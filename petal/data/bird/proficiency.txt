Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and sensitivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least sensitive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum sensitivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite sensitive. Hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of vari<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum sensitivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-sensitive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Efficient coding explains the universal law of generalization in human perception
<p>Perceptual generalization and discrimination are fundamental cognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ities. For example, if a bird eats a poisonous butterfly, it will learn to avoid preying on that species again by generalizing its past experience to new perceptual stimuli. In cognitive science, the “universal law of generalization” seeks to explain this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity and states that generalization between stimuli will follow an exponential function of their distance in “psychological space.” Here, I challenge existing theoretical explanations for the universal law and offer an alternative account based on the principle of efficient coding. I show that the universal law emerges inevitably from any information processing system (whether biological or artificial) that minimizes the cost of perceptual error subject to constraints on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to process or transmit information.</p>

Lysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging
<p>In the adult brain, the neural stem cell (NSC) pool comprises quiescent and activated populations with distinct roles. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that quiescent and activated NSCs exhibited differences in their protein homeostasis network. Whereas activated NSCs had active proteasomes, quiescent NSCs contained large lysosomes. Quiescent NSCs from young mice accumulated protein aggregates, and many of these aggregates were stored in large lysosomes. Perturbation of lysosomal activity in quiescent NSCs affected protein-aggregate accumulation and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of quiescent NSCs to activate. During aging, quiescent NSCs displayed defects in their lysosomes, increased accumulation of protein aggregates, and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to activate. Enhancement of the lysosome pathway in old quiescent NSCs cleared protein aggregates and ameliorated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of quiescent NSCs to activate, allowing them to regain a more youthful state.</p>

Heterochronic Genes Turn Back the Clock in Old Neurons
<p>Although some neuron types regenerate better than others, all neurons lose the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to regenerate with age. This intrinsic decline is the primary cause of regeneration failure even in permissive environments. This was shown in 1995 by comparing the regeneration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of retinal neurons from different aged retinas growing into tectums of different ages (<i>1</i>). Embryonic retinal axons regrew into tectum of any age, including older tectum with an inhibitory glial environment, whereas postnatal day 2 or older retinal axons failed to regrow even into embryonic tectum. This indicated a “programmed” loss of axon regeneration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity with neuron age. Similarly, young hindbrain neurons transplanted into older spinal cords could regenerate axons into a normally inhibitory myelinated environment (<i>2</i>). Despite the clear therapeutic implications of these observations, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling age-dependent regenerative capacity were unclear. On page 372 in this issue, Zou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that the highly conserved <i>let-7</i>–LIN-41 heterochronic signaling pathway is responsible for part of the age-related decline in axon regeneration in the worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Determining the Site of Action of Strigolactones during Nodulation
<p>Strigolactones (SLs) influence the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of legumes to associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. In this study, we determine the precise stage at which SLs influence nodulation. We show that SLs promote infection thread formation, as a null SL-deficient pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) mutant forms significantly fewer infection threads than wild-type plants, and this reduction can be overcome by the application of the synthetic SL GR24. We found no evidence that SLs influence physical events in the plant before or after infection thread formation, since SL-deficient plants displayed a similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to induce root hair curling in response to rhizobia or Nod lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) and SL-deficient nodules appear to fix nitrogen at a similar rate to those of wild-type plants. In contrast, an SL receptor mutant displayed no decrease in infection thread formation or nodule number, suggesting that SL deficiency may influence the bacterial partner. We found that this influence of SL deficiency was not due to altered flavonoid exudation or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of root exudates to stimulate bacterial growth. The influence of SL deficiency on infection thread formation was accompanied by reduced expression of some early nodulation genes. Importantly, SL synthesis is down-regulated by mutations in genes of the Nod LCO signaling pathway, and this requires the downstream transcription factor <i>NSP2</i> but not <i>NIN</i>. This, together with the fact that the expression of certain SL biosynthesis genes can be elevated in response to rhizobia/Nod LCOs, suggests that Nod LCOs may induce SL biosynthesis. SLs appear to influence nodulation independently of ethylene action, as SL-deficient and ethylene-insensitive double mutant plants display essentially additive phenotypes, and we found no evidence that SLs influence ethylene synthesis or vice versa.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to maintain ion and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular function and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relationship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Mediterranean Diet Improves High-Density Lipoprotein Function in High-Cardiovascular-Risk Individuals
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The biological functions of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) contribute to explaining the cardioprotective role of the lipoprotein beyond quantitative HDL cholesterol levels. A few small-scale interventions with a single antioxidant have improved some HDL functions.

We assessed the effects of both TMDs on the role of HDL particles on reverse cholesterol transport (cholesterol efflux capacity, HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to esterify cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity), HDL antioxidant properties (paraoxonase-1 arylesterase activity and total HDL antioxidant capacity on low-density lipoproteins), and HDL vasodilatory capacity (HDL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to induce the release of nitric oxide in endothelial cells).

Males exhibit competitive advantages over females of <i>Populus deltoides</i> under salinity stress
<p>Sexual competition among dioecious plants affects sex ratios and the spatial distribution of the sexes in different environments. At present, little is known about sexual dimorphisms induced by different competition patterns under salinity stress. We employed <i>Populus deltoides</i> as a model to investigate sex-related growth as well as physiological and biochemical responses to salinity stress under conditions of intrasexual and intersexual competition. Potted seedlings (two seedlings per pot; two females, two males, or one female and one male) were exposed to two salt levels (0 and 50 mM NaCl) and salinity- and competition-driven differences in growth, assimilation rate, water use, contents of leaf pigments and osmotica, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and antioxidant enzyme and nitrate reductase activity were examined. In the absence of salinity, no significant differences in competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity between males and females subjected to intrasexual competition were observed, although the growth of females was moderately greater under intersexual competition. The salinity treatment significantly increased the sex differences in competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity, especially under intersexual competition. Under salinity stress, males showed decreased height, but displayed greater capacity for osmotic adjustment, enhancement of long-term water-use efficiency and increase in antioxidant enzyme activities. The absolute values of these traits were greater in salt-stressed males than in females under intersexual competition. In addition, salt-stressed males accumulated less Cl<sup>−</sup> and had lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents than females. These data collectively demonstrate that the competitive advantage of females in non-stressed conditions is lost under salinity. Greater salinity resistance of males growing intermixed with females under salt stress can importantly affect the sex ratio of <i>P. deltoides</i> populations.</p>

Is Permanent Parasitism Reversible?—Critical Evidence from Early Evolution of House Dust Mites
<p>Long-term specialization may limit the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of a species to respond to new environmental conditions and lead to a higher likelihood of extinction. For permanent parasites and other symbionts, the most intriguing question is whether these organisms can return to a free-living lifestyle and, thus, escape an evolutionary “dead end.” This question is directly related to Dollo's law, which stipulates that a complex trait (such as being free living vs. parasitic) cannot re-evolve again in the same form. Here, we present conclusive evidence that house dust mites, a group of medically important free-living organisms, evolved from permanent parasites of warm-blooded vertebrates. A robust, multigene topology (315 taxa, 8942 nt), ancestral character state reconstruction, and a test for irreversible evolution (Dollo's law) demonstrate that house dust mites have abandoned a parasitic lifestyle, secondarily becoming free living, and then speciated in several habitats. Hence, as exemplified by this model system, highly specialized permanent parasites may drastically de-specialize to the extent of becoming free living and, thus escape from dead-end evolution. Our phylogenetic and historical ecological framework explains the limited cross-reactivity between allergens from the house dust mites and “storage” mites and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of the dust mites to inhibit host immune responses. It also provides insights into how ancestral features related to parasitism (frequent ancestral shifts to unrelated hosts, tolerance to lower humidity, and pre-existing enzymes targeting skin and keratinous materials) played a major role in reversal to the free-living state. We propose that parasitic ancestors of pyroglyphids shifted to nests of vertebrates. Later the nest-inhabiting pyroglyphids expanded into human dwellings to become a major source of allergens.

Geometric Morphometric Character Suites as Phylogenetic Data: Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Gastropod Shells
<p>Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many of the best represented constituents of the fossil record—including diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks—have mineralized skeletons with limited discrete characteristics, making morphological phylogenies difficult to construct. In contrast to their paucity of phylogenetic characters, the mineralized structures (tests and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive shapes that have long proved useful for their classification. The recent introduction of methodologies for including continuous data directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available characters, making it possible to produce phylogenies based, in whole or part, on continuous character data collected from such taxa. Geometric morphometric methods provide tools for accurately characterizing shape variation and can produce quantitative data that can therefore now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a nonarbitrary manner. Here, the marine gastropod genus <i>Conus</i> is used to evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of continuous characters—generated from a geometric morphometric analysis of shell shape—to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic hypothesis constructed using molecular and morphological data. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of continuous characters derived from geometric morphometric analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete characters into a phylogeny with their extant relatives was tested by simulating the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular partition of individual extant species to produce a “cladistic pseudofossil” with only the geometric morphometric derived characters coded. The phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then compared with its placement in the total evidence tree and a symmetric resampling tree to evaluate the degree to which morphometric characters alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33–45% of the test cases (depending upon the approach used for measuring success), it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric characters. This suggests that the incorporation of extinct <i>Conus</i> taxa into phylogenetic hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also has potential to contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions for other major components of the fossil record that lack numerous discrete characters.

Transcriptional activation of elephant shark mineralocorticoid receptor by corticosteroids, progesterone, and spironolactone
<p>The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a nuclear receptor and part of a large and diverse family of transcription factors that also includes receptors for glucocorticoids, progesterone, androgens, and estrogens. The corticosteroid aldosterone is the physiological activator of the MR in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates; however, its activator is not known in cartilaginous fish, the oldest group of extant jawed vertebrates. Here, we analyzed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of corticosteroids and progesterone to activate the full-length MR from the elephant shark (<i>Callorhinchus milii</i>). On the basis of their measured activities, aldosterone, cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxcortisol, progesterone, and 19-norprogesterone are potential physiological mineralocorticoids. However, aldosterone, the physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, is not found in cartilaginous or ray-finned fish. Although progesterone activates MRs in ray-finned fish, progesterone does not activate MRs in humans, amphibians, or alligator, suggesting that during the transition to terrestrial vertebrates, progesterone lost the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to activate the MR. Both elephant shark MR and human MR are expressed in the brain, heart, ovary, testis, and other nonepithelial tissues, suggesting that MR expression in diverse tissues evolved in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. Our data suggest that 19-norprogesterone– and progesterone-activated MR may have unappreciated functions in reproductive physiology.</p>

A defect in KCa3.1 channel activity limits the ability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from cancer patients to infiltrate an adenosine-rich microenvironment
<p>The limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of cytotoxic T cells to infiltrate solid tumors hampers immune surveillance and the efficacy of immunotherapies in cancer. Adenosine accumulates in solid tumors and inhibits tumor-specific T cells. Adenosine inhibits T cell motility through the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) and suppression of KCa3.1 channels. We conducted three-dimensional chemotaxis experiments to elucidate the effect of adenosine on the migration of peripheral blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. The chemotaxis of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was reduced in the presence of adenosine, and the effect was greater on HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells than on healthy donor (HD) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This response correlated with the in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to infiltrate tumors. The effect of adenosine was mimicked by an A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist and prevented by an A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist. We found no differences in A<sub>2A</sub>R expression, 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate abundance, or protein kinase A type 1 activity between HNSCC and HD CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We instead detected a decrease in KCa3.1 channel activity, but not expression, in HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Activation of KCa3.1 channels by 1-EBIO restored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to chemotax in the presence of adenosine. Our data highlight the mechanism underlying the increased sensitivity of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to adenosine and the potential therapeutic benefit of KCa3.1 channel activators, which could increase infiltration of these T cells into tumors.</p>

<i>Arabidopsis</i> ATXR2 deposits H3K36me3 at the promoters of <i>LBD</i> genes to facilitate cellular dedifferentiation
<p>Cellular dedifferentiation, the transition of differentiated somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells, ensures developmental plasticity and contributes to wound healing in plants. Wounding induces cells to form a mass of unorganized pluripotent cells called callus at the wound site. Explanted cells can also form callus tissues in vitro. Reversible cellular differentiation-dedifferentiation processes in higher eukaryotes are controlled mainly by chromatin modifications. We demonstrate that ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED 2 (ATXR2), a histone lysine methyltransferase that promotes the accumulation of histone H3 proteins that are trimethylated on lysine 36 (H3K36me3) during callus formation, promotes early stages of cellular dedifferentiation through activation of <i>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN</i> (<i>LBD</i>) genes. The <i>LBD</i> genes of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> are activated during cellular dedifferentiation to enhance the formation of callus. Leaf explants from <i>Arabidopsis atxr2</i> mutants exhibited a reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to form callus and a substantial reduction in <i>LBD</i> gene expression. ATXR2 bound to the promoters of <i>LBD</i> genes and was required for the deposition of H3K36me3 at these promoters. ATXR2 was recruited to <i>LBD</i> promoters by the transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF7) and ARF19. Leaf explants from <i>arf7-1arf19-2</i> double mutants were defective in callus formation and showed reduced H3K36me3 accumulation at <i>LBD</i> promoters. Genetic analysis provided further support that ARF7 and ARF19 were required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of ATXR2 to promote the expression of <i>LBD</i> genes. These observations indicate that the ATXR2-ARF-LBD axis is key for the epigenetic regulation of callus formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.</p>

The matricellular protein TSP1 promotes human and mouse endothelial cell senescence through CD47 and Nox1
<p>Senescent cells withdraw from the cell cycle and do not proliferate. The prevalence of senescent compared to normally functioning parenchymal cells increases with age, impairing tissue and organ homeostasis. A contentious principle governing this process has been the redox theory of aging. We linked matricellular protein thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) and its receptor CD47 to the activation of NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1), but not of the other closely related Nox isoforms, and associated oxidative stress, and to senescence in human cells and aged tissue. In human endothelial cells, TSP1 promoted senescence and attenuated cell cycle progression and proliferation. At the molecular level, TSP1 increased Nox1-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the increased abundance of the transcription factor p53. p53 mediated a DNA damage response that led to senescence through Rb and p21<sup>cip</sup>, both of which inhibit cell cycle progression. Nox1 inhibition blocked the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of TSP1 to increase p53 nuclear localization and p21<sup>cip</sup> abundance and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to promote senescence. Mice lacking TSP1 showed decreases in ROS production, p21<sup>cip</sup> expression, p53 activity, and aging-induced senescence. Conversely, lung tissue from aging humans displayed increases in the abundance of vascular TSP1, Nox1, p53, and p21<sup>cip</sup>. Finally, genetic ablation or pharmacological blockade of Nox1 in human endothelial cells attenuated TSP1-mediated ROS generation, restored cell cycle progression, and protected against senescence. Together, our results provide insights into the functional interplay between TSP1 and Nox1 in the regulation of endothelial senescence and suggest potential targets for controlling the aging process at the molecular level.</p>

Problem-solving males become more attractive to female budgerigars
<p>Darwin proposed that mate choice might contribute to the evolution of cognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ities. An open question is whether observing the cognitive skills of an individual makes it more attractive as a mate. In this study, we demonstrated that initially less-preferred budgerigar males became preferred after females observed that these males, but not the initially preferred ones, were able to solve extractive foraging problems. This preference shift did not occur in control experiments in which females observed males with free access to food or in which females observed female demonstrators solving these extractive foraging problems. Our results suggest that direct observation of problem-solving skills increases male attractiveness and that this could contribute to the evolution of the cognitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ities underlying such skills.</p>

Toward a chemical vaccine for malaria
<p>Despite considerable progress in combating malaria, it remains one of the world's most important infectious diseases, with 50% of the world population at risk of developing the disease and a mortality rate of ∼0.5 million annually (<i>1</i>). The lack of an effective vaccine and the relentless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite responsible for malaria to develop drug resistance has contributed to the continuing disease burden (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of current treatment regimens, but decreased effectiveness, particularly in Southeast Asia, threatens our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to control this disease. A global effort to develop new drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria is under way but not guaranteed to succeed (<i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). These efforts include a systematic attempt to target all life-cycle stages of the parasite to allow combination therapies to be developed, which are also likely to reduce the development of resistance. High-throughput screens (HTSs) designed to identify small drug-like molecules that prevent growth of blood-stage parasites (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and target-based approaches have identified new compounds that are currently in preclinical development and/or various stages of human clinical trials for treatment of malaria (<i>3</i>). Missing from these efforts has been a high-throughput technology to find liver stage–specific chemotypes. On page 1129 of this issue, Antonova-Koch <i>et al.</i> (<i>9</i>) report an HTS effort that has filled this gap. They identify a substantial number of new chemical starting points with potent liver-stage antimalarial activity, promising a new capacity to feed compounds through the drug development pipeline for chemoprotection.</p>

<p>Improving our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to construct and functionally characterize DNA sequences would broadly accelerate progress in biology. Here, we introduce DropSynth, a scalable, low-cost method to build thousands of defined gene-length constructs in a pooled (multiplexed) manner. DropSynth uses a library of barcoded beads that pull down the oligonucleotides necessary for a gene’s assembly, which are then processed and assembled in water-in-oil emulsions. We used DropSynth to successfully build more than 7000 synthetic genes that encode phylogenetically diverse homologs of two essential genes in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We tested the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase homologs to complement a knockout <i>E. coli</i> strain in multiplex, revealing core functional motifs and reasons underlying homolog incompatibility. DropSynth coupled with multiplexed functional assays allows us to rationally explore sequence-function relationships at an unprecedented scale.</p>

Wire together, fire apart
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to learn and remember new experiences lies at the heart of our existence. After all, we are our memories. It has been widely accepted that memories are formed and stored via strengthening of neural connections due to the correlated activities of neurons, where presumably one neuron is causing or at least contributing to the activity of another connecting neuron and hence becomes associated with it. This principle is known as the Hebbian learning rule (<i>1</i>): i.e., if interconnected neurons become active very close in time during a particular event, their connection strengthens and “a memory” of this event is formed (<i>1</i>). In other words, “neurons wire together, if they fire together” (<i>2</i>). Thus, neural connection must show some sort of plasticity—i.e., an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to be modified based on the mutual firing patterns of interconnected neurons—in order to form memories and associations. Indeed, it has been shown that brief (hundreds of milliseconds) stimulations of interconnected neurons significantly improve signal transmission between the two, a phenomenon known as long-term potentiation (LTP). On page 1033 of this issue, Bittner <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a different learning mechanism called behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), which spans a considerably longer time course of several seconds, implying that no causal relationship of interconnected neurons may be necessary to form long-lasting associations between them.</p>

Ravens parallel great apes in flexible planning for tool-use and bartering
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to flexibly plan for events outside of the current sensory scope is at the core of being human and is crucial to our everyday lives and society. Studies on apes have shaped a belief that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity evolved within the hominid lineage. Corvids, however, have shown evidence of planning their food hoarding, although this has been suggested to reflect a specific caching adaptation rather than domain-general planning. Here, we show that ravens plan for events unrelated to caching—tool-use and bartering—with delays of up to 17 hours, exert self-control, and consider temporal distance to future events. Their performance parallels that seen in apes and suggests that planning evolved independently in corvids, which opens new avenues for the study of cognitive evolution.</p>

A Histone Code Reader and a Transcriptional Activator Interact to Regulate Genes for Salt Tolerance
<p>Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins are involved in various developmental processes and stress responses. They recognize and bind to epigenetically modified histone H3 tail and function as histone code readers. Here we report that GmPHD6 reads low methylated histone H3K4me0/1/2 but not H3K4me3 with its N-terminal domain instead of the PHD finger. GmPHD6 does not possess transcriptional regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity but has DNA-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity. Through the PHD finger, GmPHD6 interacts with its coactivator, LHP1-1/2, to form a transcriptional activation complex. Using a transgenic hairy root system, we demonstrate that overexpression of <i>GmPHD6</i> improves stress tolerance in soybean (<i>Glycine</i> <i>max</i>) plants. Knocking down the <i>LHP1</i> expression disrupts this role of <i>GmPHD6</i>, indicating that GmPHD6 requires LHP1 functions during stress response. GmPHD6 influences expression of dozens of stress-related genes. Among these, we identified three targets of GmPHD6, including ABA-stress-ripening-induced <i>CYP75B1</i> and <i>CYP82C4</i>. Overexpression of each gene confers stress tolerance in soybean plants. GmPHD6 is recruited to H3K4me0/1/2 marks and recognizes the G-rich elements in target gene promoters, whereas LHP1 activates expression of these targets. Our study reveals a mechanism involving two partners in a complex. Manipulation of the genes in this pathway should improve stress tolerance in soybean or other legumes/crops.</p>

Plant Glandular Trichomes: Natural Cell Factories of High Biotechnological Interest
<p>Multicellular glandular trichomes are epidermal outgrowths characterized by the presence of a head made of cells that have the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to secrete or store large quantities of specialized metabolites. Our understanding of the transcriptional control of glandular trichome initiation and development is still in its infancy. This review points to some central questions that need to be addressed to better understand how such specialized cell structures arise from the plant protodermis. A key and unique feature of glandular trichomes is their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to synthesize and secrete large amounts, relative to their size, of a limited number of metabolites. As such, they qualify as true cell factories, making them interesting targets for metabolic engineering. In this review, recent advances regarding terpene metabolic engineering are highlighted, with a special focus on tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). In particular, the choice of transcriptional promoters to drive transgene expression and the best ways to sink existing pools of terpene precursors are discussed. The bioavail<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of existing pools of natural precursor molecules is a key parameter and is controlled by so-called cross talk between different biosynthetic pathways. As highlighted in this review, the exact nature and extent of such cross talk are only partially understood at present. In the future, awareness of, and detailed knowledge on, the biology of plant glandular trichome development and metabolism will generate new leads to tap the largely unexploited potential of glandular trichomes in plant resistance to pests and lead to the improved production of specialized metabolites with high industrial or pharmacological value.</p>

A Plant Cryptochrome Controls Key Features of the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Circadian Clock and Its Life Cycle
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-binding proteins that act as blue light receptors in bacteria, fungi, plants, and insects and are components of the circadian oscillator in mammals. Animal and plant cryptochromes are evolutionarily divergent, although the unicellular alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas</i> throughout) has both an animal-like cryptochrome and a plant cryptochrome (pCRY; formerly designated CPH1). Here, we show that the pCRY protein accumulates at night as part of a complex. Functional characterization of pCRY was performed based on an insertional mutant that expresses only 11% of the wild-type pCRY level. The <i>pcry</i> mutant is defective for central properties of the circadian clock. In the mutant, the period is lengthened significantly, ultimately resulting in arrhythmicity, while blue light-based phase shifts show large deviations from what is observed in wild-type cells. We also show that pCRY is involved in gametogenesis in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. pCRY is down-regulated in pregametes and gametes, and in the <i>pcry</i> mutant, there is altered transcript accumulation under blue light of the strictly light-dependent, gamete-specific gene <i>GAS28</i>. pCRY acts as a negative regulator for the induction of mating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity in the light and for the loss of mating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity in the dark. Moreover, pCRY is necessary for light-dependent germination, during which the zygote undergoes meiosis that gives rise to four vegetative cells. In sum, our data demonstrate that pCRY is a key blue light receptor in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> that is involved in both circadian timing and life cycle progression.</p>

Detainment of Tam3 Transposase at Plasma Membrane by Its BED-Zinc Finger Domain
<p>Transposable elements (TEs) are considered to be parasites of host genomes because they act as powerful mutagens. If not kept in check, they can cause gene disruption, genome rearrangement, and genomic takeover. Hence, activities of TEs are under the rigid control of hosts. To date, all identified TE regulations have been epigenetic dependent, with the exception of the DNA transposon Tam3. Blocking nuclear translocation of Tam3 transposase (TPase) is consistent with the suppression of Tam3 in <i>Antirrhinum majus</i>. In this article, we discovered that epigenetic-independent regulation of Tam3 is mediated by the BED-zinc finger (Znf-BED) domain of Tam3 TPase. The host targets the N terminus of the Znf-BED domain, which contains two highly conserved aromatic amino acids, to detain Tam3 TPase at the plasma membrane and to silence Tam3. Zinc finger proteins perform broader functions in transcriptional regulation through their DNA binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity. Our data revealed that the posttranslational epigenetic-independent silencing against TEs was a result of the protein binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of the Znf-BED domain.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Developmental Brain Gene <i>NPAS3</i> Contains the Largest Number of Accelerated Regulatory Sequences in the Human Genome
<p>To identify the evolutionary genetic novelties that contributed to shape human-specific traits such as the use of a complex language, long-term planning and exceptional learning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ities is one of the ultimate frontiers of modern biology. Evolutionary signatures of functional shifts could be detected by comparing noncoding regions that are highly conserved across mammals or primates and rapidly accumulated nucleotide substitutions only in the lineage leading to humans. As gene loci densely populated with human-accelerated elements (HAEs) are more likely to have contributed to human-specific novelties, we sought to identify the transcriptional units and genomic 1 Mb intervals of the entire human genome carrying the highest number of HAEs. To this end, we took advantage of four available data sets of human genomic accelerated regions obtained through different comparisons and algorithms and performed a meta-analysis of the combined data. We found that the brain developmental transcription factor <i>neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3</i> (<i>NPAS3</i>) contains the largest cluster of noncoding-accelerated regions in the human genome with up to 14 elements that are highly conserved in mammals, including primates, but carry human-specific nucleotide substitutions. We then tested the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of the 14 HAEs identified at the <i>NPAS3</i> locus to act as transcriptional regulatory sequences in a reporter expression assay performed in transgenic zebrafish. We found that 11 out of the 14 HAEs present in <i>NPAS3</i> act as transcriptional enhancers during development, particularly within the nervous system. As <i>NPAS3</i> is known to play a crucial role during mammalian brain development, our results indicate that the high density of HAEs present in the human <i>NPAS3</i> locus could have modified the spatiotemporal expression pattern of <i>NPAS3</i> in the developing human brain and, therefore, contributed to human brain evolution.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal vari<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity in constitutive immunity is associated with vari<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (<i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>)
<p>Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ities are widespread among vertebrates. While experiments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ities in <i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia desert. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not controlled for non-numerical continuous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli controlled for continuous quantities and half not controlled for continuous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli controlled for continuous quantities proved able to learn the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish tested with visual stimuli.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

Invasion and adaptation of a warm-adapted species to montane localities: effect of acclimation potential
<p><i>Drosophila ananassae</i> has successfully invaded the cold and dry montane localities of the Western Himalayas in recent years. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of this desiccation- and cold-sensitive tropical species to evolve in response to seasonal changes in montane localities is largely unknown. Here, we investigated how this sensitive species adapt to seasonally varying environmental conditions that are lethal to its survival. We observed change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i> in five mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000–2010). We document invasion of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities and increase in frequency of the dark morph. The stress tolerance of morphs (dark and light) remained unaffected of developmental acclimation. However, adult acclimation has shown significant effects on tolerance to various environmental stresses in morphs and effect of this acclimation persist for long durations. Desiccation and cold stress tolerance was increased after adult acclimation for respective stress in the dark morph; while tolerance of the light morph was not affected. Further, heat tolerance of the light morph was increased after adult heat acclimation with no influence on heat tolerance of the dark morph. Our results suggest a possible role of adult acclimation in successful invasion and adaptation of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities. Future experiments should be carried out to determine whether the survival in adverse conditions of low <i>versus</i> high temperature and humidity during seasonal changes is assisted by different acclimation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ities of the two morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i>.</p>

Highly efficient targeted mutagenesis in axolotl using Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease
<p>Among tetrapods, only urodele salamanders, such as the axolotl <i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>, can completely regenerate limbs as adults. The mystery of why salamanders, but not other animals, possess this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity has for generations captivated scientists seeking to induce this phenomenon in other vertebrates. Although many recent advances in molecular biology have allowed limb regeneration and tissue repair in the axolotl to be investigated in increasing detail, the molecular toolkit for the study of this process has been limited. Here, we report that the CRISPR-Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease system can efficiently create mutations at targeted sites within the axolotl genome. We identify individual animals treated with RNA-guided nucleases that have mutation frequencies close to 100% at targeted sites. We employ this technique to completely functionally ablate EGFP expression in transgenic animals and recapitulate developmental phenotypes produced by loss of the conserved gene <i>brachyury</i>. Thus, this advance allows a reverse genetic approach in the axolotl and will undoubtedly provide invaluable insight into the mechanisms of salamanders' unique regenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

‘Modern’ distal femoral locking plates allow safe, early weight-bearing with a high rate of union and low rate of failure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the distal femur can be challenging to manage and   are on the increase in the elderly osteoporotic population. Management   with casting or bracing can unacceptably limit a patient’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity   to bear weight, but historically, operative fixation has been associated   with a high rate of re-operation. In this study, we describe the outcomes   of fixation using modern implants within a strategy of early return   to function.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients treated at our centre with lateral distal femoral   locking plates (LDFLP) between 2009 and 2014 were identified. Fracture   classification and operative information including weight-bearing   status, rates of union, re-operation, failure of implants and mortality   rate, were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 127 fractures were identified in 122 patients. The   mean age was 72.8 years (16 to 101) and 92 of the patients (75%)   were female. A consultant performed the operation in 85 of the cases,   (67%) with the remainder performed under direct consultant supervision.   In total 107 patients (84%) were allowed to bear full weight immediately.   The rate of clinical and radiological union was 81/85 (95%) and   only four fractures of 127 (3%) fractures required re-operation   for failure of surgery. The 30-day, three- and 12-month mortality   rates were 6 (5%), 17 (15%) and 25 (22%), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study suggests an exponential increase in the incidence of   a fracture of the distal femur with age, analogous to the population   suffering from a proximal femoral fracture. Allowing immediate unrestricted   weight-bearing after LDFLP fixation in these elderly patients was   not associated with failure of fixation. There was a high rate of   union and low rate of re-operation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:951–7.</p></sec>

Arthroscopic decompression not recommended in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Rotator cuff tendinopathy has a multifactorial origin. Rejecting   the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning operative treatment   at initial presentation in the first line. Physiotherapy exercise   programmes are the accepted first line treatment. The aim of this   study was to assess the long-term additional benefits of subacromial decompression   in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This randomised controlled trial of 140 patients (52 men, 88   women, mean age 47.1 years; 18 to 60) with rotator cuff tendinopathy   extended previous work up to a maximum of 13 years. The patients   were randomised into two treatment groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty   and a supervised exercise treatment and a similar supervised exercise   treatment alone. Self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS)   was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures were dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity,   working <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity, pain at night, Shoulder Dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity Questionnaire   score and the number of painful days during the three months preceding   the final assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 90 patients (64%) returned questionnaires at a mean   12 years after randomisation. On an intention-to-treat basis, both   treatment groups reached statistically significant improvement compared   with the initial VAS for pain, but there was no significant difference   between groups. The same was true in the secondary outcome measures.   Due to group changes, the results were also analysed per protocol:   operated or not. No significant differences between the groups were   found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The natural history of rotator cuff tendinopathy probably plays   a significant role in the results in the long-term. Even though   the patients who underwent operative treatment had a stronger belief   in recovery, which is likely to be surgical and the effect of placebo,   the exercise group obtained similar results. In the future, an optimum   exercise regime should be searched for, as the most clinically and   cost-effective conservative treatment for rotator cuff tendinopathy.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:799–805.</p></sec>

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteoarthritis   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Our aim was to   investigate the long-term outcome of a consecutive series of patients,   some of whom had anterior knee pain and PFJ OA managed with UKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We assessed the ten-year functional outcomes and 15-year implant   survival of 805 knees (677 patients) following medial mobile-bearing   UKA. The intra-operative status of the PFJ was documented and, with   the exception of bone loss with grooving to the lateral side, neither   the clinical or radiological state of the PFJ nor the presence of   anterior knee pain were considered a contraindication. The impact   of radiographic findings and anterior knee pain was studied in a   subgroup of 100 knees (91 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no relationship between functional outcomes, at a mean   of ten years, or 15-year implant survival, and pre-operative anterior   knee pain, or the presence or degree of cartilage loss documented   intra-operatively at the medial patella or trochlea, or radiographic   evidence of OA in the medial side of the PFJ. In 6% of cases there   was full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral side of the patella.   In these cases, the overall ten-year function and 15-year survival   was similar to those without cartilage loss; however they had slightly   more difficulty with descending stairs. Radiographic signs of OA   seen in the lateral part of the PFJ were not associated with a definite   compromise in functional outcome or implant survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ with bone loss and   grooving remains a contraindication to mobile-bearing UKA. Less   severe damage to the lateral side of the PFJ and damage to the medial   side, however severe, does not compromise the overall function or   survival, so should not be considered to be a contraindication. However,   if a patient does have full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral   side of the PFJ they may have a slight compromise in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity   to descend stairs. Pre-operative anterior knee pain also does not   compromise the functional outcome or survival and should not be   considered to be a contraindication.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:632–9</p></sec>

Functional outcome of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention in periprosthetic joint infection involving the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advocates of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR)   in hip periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) argue that a procedure   not disturbing a sound prosthesis-bone interface is likely to lead   to better survival and functional outcome compared with revision.   This case-control study aims were to compare outcome of DAIRs for   infected primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with outcomes following   primary THA and two-stage revision of infected primary THAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed all DAIRs, performed for confirmed   infected primary hip arthropasty (n = 82) at out institution, between   1997 and 2013. Data recorded included full patient information and   type of surgery. Outcome measures included complications, mortality,   implant survivorship and functional outcome. Outcome was compared with   two control groups matched for gender and age; a cohort of primary   THAs (n = 120) and a cohort of two-stage revisions for infection   (n = 66).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean age at DAIR was 69 years (33 to 87) and mean follow-up was   eight years (2 to 17; standard deviation (<sc>sd)</sc> 5). A total   of 52 (63%) of DAIRs were for early PJI (less than six weeks). Greater   success in the eradication of infection with DAIR was identified   with early PJI, comprising an interval less than a week between   onset of symptoms and exchange of modular components with the DAIR   procedure. Eradication of infection, complications and re-operation   rates were similar in the DAIR and two-stage revision groups. For   hips with successful eradication of infection with DAIR, the five-year   survival (98%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 94 to 100) was similar   to the primary THA group (98%; 95% CI 95 to 100) (n = 43; p = 0.3).   The DAIR group had inferior mean Oxford Hip Scores (OHS) (38; 12   to 48) compared with the primary THA group (42; 15 to 48) (p = 0.02)   but a significantly better mean OHS compared with the two-stage   revision group (31; 0 to 48) (p = 0.008). Patients who required   only one DAIR for eradication of infection had a similar mean OHS   (41; 20 to 48) to the primary THA group (p = 0.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The DAIR procedure is associated with a similar complication   rate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to eradicate infection as two-stage revision. This   study emphasises the need for exchange of modular components for   improved chances of eradication of infection. This is the first   study showing that DAIR is better than a two-stage revision regarding   functional outcome.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:614–22.</p></sec>

Reconstruction of non-contained acetabular defects with impaction grafting, a reinforcement mesh and a cemented polyethylene acetabular component
<p>This review summarises the technique of impaction   grafting with mesh augmentation for the treatment of uncontained   acetabular defects in revision hip arthroplasty.</p><p>The ideal acetabular revision should restore bone stock, use   a small socket in the near-anatomic position, and provide durable   fixation.

The precepts of modern, revision impaction grafting are   that the segmental or cavitary defects must be supported with a   mesh; the contained cavity is filled with vigorously impacted morselised   fresh-frozen allograft; and finally, acrylic cement is used to st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ise   the graft and provide rigid, long-lasting fixation of the revised   acetabular component.</p><p>Favourable results have been published with this technique.

Draft genome sequence of an inbred line of <i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>, an allotetraploid crop with great environmental adaptability and outstanding nutritional properties
<p><i>Chenopodium quinoa</i> Willd. (quinoa) originated from the Andean region of South America, and is a pseudocereal crop of the Amaranthaceae family. Quinoa is emerging as an important crop with the potential to contribute to food security worldwide and is considered to be an optimal food source for astronauts, due to its outstanding nutritional profile and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to tolerate stressful environments. Furthermore, plant pathologists use quinoa as a representative diagnostic host to identify virus species. However, molecular analysis of quinoa is limited by its genetic heterogeneity due to outcrossing and its genome complexity derived from allotetraploidy. To overcome these obstacles, we established the inbred and standard quinoa accession Kd that enables rigorous molecular analysis, and presented the draft genome sequence of Kd, using an optimized combination of high-throughput next generation sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 and PacBio RS II sequencers. The <i>de novo</i> genome assembly contained 25 k scaffolds consisting of 1 Gbp with N50 length of 86 kbp. Based on these data, we constructed the free-access Quinoa Genome DataBase (QGDB). Thus, these findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying agronomically important traits of quinoa and the effect of allotetraploidy on genome evolution.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous system function (learning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous systems, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Precise control of miR-125b levels is required to create a regeneration-permissive environment after spinal cord injury: a cross-species comparison between salamander and rat
<p>Most spinal cord injuries lead to permanent paralysis in mammals. By contrast, the remarkable regenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ities of salamanders enable full functional recovery even from complete spinal cord transections. The molecular differences underlying this evolutionary divergence between mammals and amphibians are poorly understood. We focused on upstream regulators of gene expression as primary entry points into this question. We identified a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are conserved between the Mexican axolotl salamander (<i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>) and mammals but show marked cross-species differences in regulation patterns following spinal cord injury. We found that precise post-injury levels of one of these miRNAs (miR-125b) is essential for functional recovery, and guides correct regeneration of axons through the lesion site in a process involving the direct downstream target <i>Sema4D</i> in axolotls. Translating these results to a mammalian model, we increased miR-125b levels in the rat through mimic treatments following spinal cord transection. These treatments downregulated <i>Sema4D</i> and other glial-scar-related genes, and enhanced the animal’s functional recovery. Our study identifies a key regulatory molecule conserved between salamander and mammal, and shows that the expression of <i>miR-125b</i> and <i>Sema4D</i> must be carefully controlled in the right cells at the correct level to promote regeneration. We also show that these molecular components of the salamander’s regeneration-permissive environment can be experimentally harnessed to improve treatment outcomes for mammalian spinal cord injuries.</p>

Ligand-dependent Notch signaling strength orchestrates lateral induction and lateral inhibition in the developing inner ear
<p>During inner ear development, Notch exhibits two modes of operation: lateral induction, which is associated with prosensory specification, and lateral inhibition, which is involved in hair cell determination. These mechanisms depend respectively on two different ligands, jagged 1 (Jag1) and delta 1 (Dl1), that rely on a common signaling cascade initiated after Notch activation. In the chicken otocyst, expression of Jag1 and the Notch target Hey1 correlates well with lateral induction, whereas both Jag1 and Dl1 are expressed during lateral inhibition, as are Notch targets Hey1 and Hes5. Here, we show that Jag1 drives lower levels of Notch activity than Dl1, which results in the differential expression of Hey1 and Hes5. In addition, Jag1 interferes with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of Dl1 to elicit high levels of Notch activity. Modeling the sensory epithelium when the two ligands are expressed together shows that ligand regulation, differential signaling strength and ligand competition are crucial to allow the two modes of operation and for establishing the alternate pattern of hair cells and supporting cells. Jag1, while driving lateral induction on its own, facilitates patterning by lateral inhibition in the presence of Dl1. This novel behavior emerges from Jag1 acting as a competitive inhibitor of Dl1 for Notch signaling. Both modeling and experiments show that hair cell patterning is very robust. The model suggests that autoactivation of proneural factor Atoh1, upstream of Dl1, is a fundamental component for robustness. The results stress the importance of the levels of Notch signaling and ligand competition for Notch function.</p>

A microdevice to locally electroporate embryos with high efficiency and reduced cell damage
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity to follow and modify cell behaviour with accurate spatiotemporal resolution is a prerequisite to study morphogenesis in developing organisms. Electroporation, the delivery of exogenous molecules into targeted cell populations through electric permeation of the plasma membrane, has been used with this aim in different model systems. However, current localised electroporation strategies suffer from insufficient reproducibility and mediocre survival when applied to small and delicate organisms such as early post-implantation mouse embryos. We introduce here a microdevice to achieve localised electroporation with high efficiency and reduced cell damage. <i>In silico</i> simulations using a simple electrical model of mouse embryos indicated that a dielectric guide-based design would improve on existing alternatives. Such a device was microfabricated and its capacities tested by targeting the distal visceral endoderm (DVE), a migrating cell population essential for anterior-posterior axis establishment. Transfection was efficiently and reproducibly restricted to fewer than four visceral endoderm cells without compromising cell behaviour and embryo survival. Combining targeted mosaic expression of fluorescent markers with live imaging in transgenic embryos revealed that, like leading DVE cells, non-leading ones send long basal projections and intercalate during their migration. Finally, we show that the use of our microsystem can be extended to a variety of embryological contexts, from preimplantation stages to organ explants. Hence, we have experimentally validated an approach delivering a tailor-made tool for the study of morphogenesis in the mouse embryo. Furthermore, we have delineated a comprehensive strategy for the development of ad hoc electroporation devices.</p>

The phosphorylation status of Ascl1 is a key determinant of neuronal differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>
<p>Generation of neurons from patient fibroblasts using a combination of developmentally defined transcription factors has great potential in disease modelling, as well as ultimately for use in regeneration and repair. However, generation of physiologically mature neurons <i>in vitro</i> remains problematic. Here we demonstrate the cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of a key reprogramming transcription factor, Ascl1, on multiple serine-proline sites. This multisite phosphorylation is a crucial regulator of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ity of Ascl1 to drive neuronal differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> in the developing embryo; a phosphomutant form of Ascl1 shows substantially enhanced neuronal induction activity in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos. Mechanistically, we see that this un(der)phosphorylated Ascl1 is resistant to inhibition by both cyclin-dependent kinase activity and Notch signalling, both of which normally limit its neurogenic potential. Ascl1 is a central component of reprogramming transcription factor cocktails to generate neurons from human fibroblasts; the use of phosphomutant Ascl1 in place of the wild-type protein significantly promotes neuronal maturity after human fibroblast reprogramming <i>in vitro</i>. These results demonstrate that cell-cycle-dependent post-translational modification of proneural proteins directly regulates neuronal differentiation <i>in vivo</i> during development, and that this regulatory mechanism can be harnessed to promote maturation of neurons obtained by transdifferentiation of human cells <i>in vitro</i>.</p>

The RNA-binding protein Mex3b regulates the spatial organization of the Rap1 pathway
<p>The four related mammalian MEX-3 RNA-binding proteins are evolutionarily conserved molecules for which the <i>in vivo</i> functions have not yet been fully characterized. Here, we report that male mice deficient for the gene encoding Mex3b are subfertile. Seminiferous tubules of <i>Mex3b</i>-deficient mice are obstructed as a consequence of the disrupted phagocytic capacity of somatic Sertoli cells. In addition, both the formation and the integrity of the blood-testis barrier are compromised owing to mislocalization of N-cadherin and connexin 43 at the surface of Sertoli cells. We further establish that Mex3b acts to regulate the cortical level of activated Rap1, a small G protein controlling phagocytosis and cell-cell interaction, through the activation and transport of Rap1GAP. The active form of Rap1 (Rap1-GTP) is abnormally increased at the membrane cortex and chemically restoring Rap1-GTP to physiological levels rescues the phagocytic and adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abil</span></strong>ities of Sertoli cells. Overall, these findings implicate Mex3b in the spatial organization of the Rap1 pathway that orchestrates Sertoli cell functions.</p>

Cardiovascular Outcomes and Risks After Initiation of a Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials have shown cardiovascular benefits and potential risks from sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i).

Incidence rates, hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time to first composite end point of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure event, major adverse cardiovascular events (defined as all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke), and individual end points were evaluated using conditional Cox models comparing new SGLT2i users with other antihyperglycemic agents.

Intent-to-treat and on-treatment analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After propensity matching, 25 258 patients were followed for a median of 1.6 years. Compared with non-SGLT2i, initiation of SGLT2i was associated with a lower rate of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure (1.73 versus 3.01 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50–0.65) and major adverse cardiovascular events (2.31 versus 3.45 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60–0.75). SGLT2i initiation was also associated with an ≈2-fold higher risk of below-knee lower extremity amputation (0.17 versus 0.09 events per 100 person-years; HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12–3.51). Because of the disproportionate canagliflozin exposure in the database, the majority of amputations were observed on canagliflozin. Results were consistent in the on-treatment analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this high-risk cohort, initiation of SGLT2i was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and major adverse cardiovascular events and higher risk of below-knee lower extremity amputation. Findings underscore the potential benefit and risks to be aware of when initiating SGLT2i. It remains unclear whether the below-knee lower extremity amputation risk extends across the class of medication, because the study was not powered to make comparisons among individual treatments.</p></sec>

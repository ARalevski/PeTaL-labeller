Intense threat switches dorsal raphe serotonin neurons to a paradoxical operational mode
<p>Survival depends on the selection of behaviors adaptive for the current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the sky. Although serotonin has been implicated in adaptive behavior, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that stimulation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments but induced escape behavior in high-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe serotonin neural dynamics inverted in high-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Stimulation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, and movement-related GABA neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Thus, dorsal raphe circuits switch between distinct operational modes to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment-specific adaptive behaviors.</p>

Emergent simplicity in microbial community assembly
<p>A major unresolved question in microbiome research is whether the complex taxonomic architectures observed in surveys of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es can be explained and predicted by fundamental, quantitative principles. Bridging theory and experiment is hampered by the multiplicity of ecological processes that simultaneously affect community assembly in natural ecosystems. We addressed this challenge by monitoring the assembly of hundreds of soil- and plant-derived microbiomes in well-controlled minimal synthetic media. Both the community-level function and the coarse-grained taxonomy of the resulting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es are highly predictable and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ed by nutrient availability, despite substantial species variability. By generalizing classical ecological models to include widespread nonspecific cross-feeding, we show that these features are all emergent properties of the assembly of large microbial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es, explaining their ubiquity in natural microbiomes.</p>

The Global Cardiovascular Risk Transition
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>It is commonly assumed that cardiovascular disease risk factors are associated with affluence and Westernization. We investigated the associations of body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose, systolic blood pressure, and serum total cholesterol with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income, Western diet, and, for BMI, urbanization in 1980 and 2008.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Country-level risk factor estimates for 199 countries between 1980 and 2008 were from a previous systematic analysis of population-based data. We analyzed the associations between risk factors and per capita <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income, a measure of Western diet, and, for BMI, the percentage of the population living in urban areas. In 1980, there was a positive association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income and population mean BMI, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol. By 2008, the slope of the association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income and systolic blood pressure became negative for women and zero for men. Total cholesterol was associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income and Western diet in both 1980 and 2008. In 1980, BMI rose with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al income and then flattened at ≈Int$7000; by 2008, the relationship resembled an inverted U for women, peaking at middle-income levels. BMI had a positive relationship with the percentage of urban population in both 1980 and 2008. Fasting plasma glucose had weaker associations with these country macro characteristics, but it was positively associated with BMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The changing associations of metabolic risk factors with macroeconomic variables indicate that there will be a global pandemic of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, together with high blood pressure in low-income countries, unless effective lifestyle and pharmacological interventions are implemented.</p></sec>

Structure, spatial dynamics, and stability of novel seed dispersal mutualistic networks in Hawai<bold></bold>i
<p>Increasing rates of human-caused species invasions and extinctions may reshape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es and modify the structure, dynamics, and stability of species interactions. To investigate how such changes affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es, we performed multiscale analyses of seed dispersal networks on Oahu, Hawaii. Networks consisted exclusively of novel interactions, were largely dominated by introduced species, and exhibited specialized and modular structure at local and regional scales, despite high interaction dissimilarity across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es. Furthermore, the structure and stability of the novel networks were similar to native-dominated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es worldwide. Our findings suggest that shared evolutionary history is not a necessary process for the emergence of complex network structure, and interaction patterns may be highly conserved, regardless of species identity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. Introduced species can quickly become well integrated into novel networks, making restoration of native ecosystems more challenging than previously thought.</p>

Ocean biogeochemistry modeled with emergent trait-based genomics
<p>Marine ecosystem models have advanced to incorporate metabolic pathways discovered with genomic sequencing, but direct comparisons between models and “omics” data are lacking. We developed a model that directly simulates metagenomes and metatranscriptomes for comparison with observations. Model microbes were randomly assigned genes for specialized functions, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es of 68 species were simulated in the Atlantic Ocean. Unfit organisms were replaced, and the model self-organized to develop community genomes and transcriptomes. Emergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es from simulations that were initialized with different cohorts of randomly generated microbes all produced realistic vertical and horizontal ocean nutrient, genome, and transcriptome gradients. Thus, the library of gene functions available to the community, rather than the distribution of functions among specific organisms, drove community assembly and biogeochemical gradients in the model ocean.</p>

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment into separate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>s of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment using separate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process separate signals and perform multiple computations in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Autonomous vehicles: No driver…no regulation?
<p>According to the latest statistics from the U.S. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 37,461 people were killed on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>'s roads in 2016 (<i>1</i>).

However, proper safeguards must be established immediately by federal regulators to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong> the testing and deployment of AVs and ensure public safety. We must not undermine current safety standards for the sake of AV development. Moreover, reconsidering current requirements may be necessary to take advantage of this revolution.

If commonsense protections are not in place to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong> AV development, and problems occur, the public will reject AVs, and the opportunity this new technology presents to improve public safety will be lost.</p>

The effect of partisanship and political advertising on close family ties

Using anonymized smartphone-location data and precinct-level voting, we show that Thanksgiving dinners attended by residents from opposing-party precincts were 30 to 50 minutes shorter than same-party dinners. This decline from a mean of 257 minutes survives extensive spatial and demographic controls. Reductions in the duration of Thanksgiving dinner in 2016 tripled for travelers from media markets with heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polit</span></strong>ical advertising—an effect not observed in 2015—implying a relationship to election-related behavior.

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es can interact to organize their behavior. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the behavior of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es undergoing metabolic oscillations can become coupled through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. Coupling increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase oscillations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their behavior to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

Agriculturally dominated landscapes reduce bee phylogenetic diversity and pollination services

Ancient convergent losses of <i>Paraoxonase 1</i> yield potential risks for modern marine mammals
<p>Mammals diversified by colonizing drastically different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, with each transition yielding numerous molecular changes, including losses of protein function. Though not initially deleterious, these losses could subsequently carry deleterious pleiotropic consequences. We have used phylogenetic methods to identify convergent functional losses across independent marine mammal lineages. In one extreme case, <i>Paraoxonase 1</i> (<i>PON1</i>) accrued lesions in all marine lineages, while remaining intact in all terrestrial mammals. These lesions coincide with PON1 enzymatic activity loss in marine species’ blood plasma. This convergent loss is likely explained by parallel shifts in marine ancestors’ lipid metabolism and/or bloodstream oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment affecting PON1’s role in fatty acid oxidation. PON1 loss also eliminates marine mammals’ main defense against neurotoxicity from specific man-made organophosphorus compounds, implying potential risks in modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Anatomy of STEM teaching in North American universities

We identified CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) as being essential for the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses to intestinal fungi. CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs express antifungal receptors and activate antifungal responses in a Syk-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> MNPs in mice led to changes in gut fungal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">communiti</span></strong>es and to severe colitis that was rescued by antifungal treatment. In Crohn’s disease patients, a missense mutation in the gene encoding CX3CR1 was identified and found to be associated with impaired antifungal responses.

How the news media activate public expression and influence national agendas
<p>We demonstrate that exposure to the news media causes Americans to take public stands on specific issues, join <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al policy conversations, and express themselves publicly—all key components of democratic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polit</span></strong>ics—more often than they would otherwise. After recruiting 48 mostly small media outlets, we chose groups of these outlets to write and publish articles on subjects we approved, on dates we randomly assigned. We estimated the causal effect on proximal measures, such as website pageviews and Twitter discussion of the articles’ specific subjects, and distal ones, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>al Twitter conversation in broad policy areas. Our intervention increased discussion in each broad policy area by ~62.7% (relative to a day’s volume), accounting for 13,166 additional posts over the treatment week, with similar effects across population subgroups.</p>

An environment-dependent transcriptional network specifies human microglia identity
<p>Microglia play essential roles in central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis and influence diverse aspects of neuronal function. However, the transcriptional mechanisms that specify human microglia phenotypes are largely unknown. We examined the transcriptomes and epigenetic landscapes of human microglia isolated from surgically resected brain tissue ex vivo and after transition to an in vitro <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. Transfer to a tissue culture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment resulted in rapid and extensive down-regulation of microglia-specific genes that were induced in primitive mouse macrophages after migration into the fetal brain. Substantial subsets of these genes exhibited altered expression in neurodegenerative and behavioral diseases and were associated with noncoding risk variants. These findings reveal an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment-dependent transcriptional network specifying microglia-specific programs of gene expression and facilitate efforts to understand the roles of microglia in human brain diseases.</p>

New Ebola outbreak rings alarm bells early

HIV infections are spiking among young gay Chinese

Heterochronic Genes Turn Back the Clock in Old Neurons
<p>Although some neuron types regenerate better than others, all neurons lose the ability to regenerate with age. This intrinsic decline is the primary cause of regeneration failure even in permissive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. This was shown in 1995 by comparing the regeneration ability of retinal neurons from different aged retinas growing into tectums of different ages (<i>1</i>). Embryonic retinal axons regrew into tectum of any age, including older tectum with an inhibitory glial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, whereas postnatal day 2 or older retinal axons failed to regrow even into embryonic tectum. This indicated a “programmed” loss of axon regeneration ability with neuron age. Similarly, young hindbrain neurons transplanted into older spinal cords could regenerate axons into a normally inhibitory myelinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment (<i>2</i>). Despite the clear therapeutic implications of these observations, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling age-dependent regenerative capacity were unclear. On page 372 in this issue, Zou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that the highly conserved <i>let-7</i>–LIN-41 heterochronic signaling pathway is responsible for part of the age-related decline in axon regeneration in the worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.</p>

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or averaged across individuals. Therefore, computational methods are used to reconstruct representative prototypes using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and calculating means. The same problem applies to the root system architecture (RSA) of plants. Several computer programs are available for extracting numerical data from root images, but they usually do not offer customized data analysis or visual reconstruction of RSA. We developed Root-VIS, a free software tool that facilitates the determi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong> of means and variance of many different RSA features across user-selected sets of root images. Furthermore, Root-VIS offers several options to generate visual reconstructions of root systems from the averaged data to enable screening and modeling. We confirmed the suitability of Root-VIS, combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo, for the rapid characterization of genotype-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major mineral types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these minerals and the control that the leaf exerts over mineral deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the mineral locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the minerals, and mineral volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D mineral distribution that is preserved in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. The mineral distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

Genomic Basis of Adaptive Evolution: The Survival of Amur Ide (<i>Leuciscu</i>s <i>waleckii</i>) in an Extremely Alkaline Environment
<p>The Amur ide (<i>Leuciscus waleckii</i>) is a cyprinid fish that is widely distributed in Northeast Asia. The Lake Dali Nur population inhabits one of the most extreme aquatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments on Earth, with an alkalinity up to 50 mmol/L (pH 9.6), thus providing an exceptional model with which to characterize the mechanisms of genomic evolution underlying adaptation to extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Here, we developed the reference genome assembly for <i>L. waleckii</i> from Lake Dali Nur. Intriguingly, we identified unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> genome. We also identified expansions in genes encoding egg coat proteins and natriuretic peptide receptors, possibly underlying the adaptation to extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental stress. We further sequenced the genomes of 10 additional individuals from freshwater and 18 from Lake Dali Nur populations, and we detected a total of 7.6 million SNPs from both populations. In a genome scan and comparison of these two populations, we identified a set of genomic regions under selective sweeps that harbor genes involved in ion homoeostasis, acid-base regulation, unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species elimi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>, and urea excretion. Our findings provide comprehensive insight into the genomic mechanisms of teleost fish that underlie their adaptation to extreme alkaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Dynamic Convergent Evolution Drives the Passage Adaptation across 48 Years’ History of H3N2 Influenza Evolution
<p>Influenza viruses are often propagated in a diverse set of culturing media and additional substitutions known as passage adaptation can cause extra evolution in the target strain, leading to ineffective vaccines. Using 25,482 H3N2 HA1 sequences curated from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data and National Center for Biotechnology Information databases, we found that passage adaptation is a very dynamic process that changes over time and evolves in a seesaw like pattern. After crossing the species boundary from bird to human in 1968, the influenza H3N2 virus evolves to be better adapted to the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment and passaging them in embryonated eggs (i.e., an avian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment) leads to increasingly stronger positive selection. On the contrary, passage adaptation to the mammalian cell lines changes from positive selection to negative selection. Using two statistical tests, we identified 19 codon positions around the receptor binding domain strongly contributing to passage adaptation in the embryonated egg. These sites show strong convergent evolution and overlap extensively with positively selected sites identified in humans, suggesting that passage adaptation can confound many of the earlier studies on influenza evolution. Interestingly, passage adaptation in recent years seems to target a few codon positions in antigenic surface epitopes, which makes it difficult to produce antigenically unaltered vaccines using embryonic eggs. Our study outlines another interesting scenario whereby both convergent and adaptive evolution are working in synchrony driving viral adaptation. Future studies from sequence analysis to vaccine production need to take careful consideration of passage adaptation.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemaggluti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong>, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies
<p>Life experiences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether differences in experience could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking males that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social experience and physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> males are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. Although dominant males are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression based on experience. We hypothesized that as males mature they might hone their fighting tactics based on observation of other males fighting. We compared males of different ages and sizes in distinctly different physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments and subsequently tested their fighting skills. We found that a size difference previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that males only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that experience is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant experience than the physical complexity of the territory.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature variations experienced in its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Aging and its modulation in a long-lived worker caste of the honey bee
<p>Highly social animals provide alternative aging models in which vastly different lifespan patterns are flexible, and linked to social caste. Research in these species aims to reveal how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, including social cues, can shape the transition between short-lived and extremely long-lived phenotypes with negligible senescence. Among honey bee workers, short to intermediate lifespans are typical for summer castes, while the winter caste can live up to 10 times longer. For summer castes, experimental interventions could predictably accelerate, slow or revert functional senescence. In contrast, little is known about the partic ular conditions under which periods of negligible senescence in winter castes can be disrupted or sustained. We asked how manipulation of social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment in colonies with long-lived winter bees might alter the pace of functional senescence, measured as learning performance, as well as of cellular senescence, measured as lipofuscin accumulation. We show that behavioral senescence becomes rapidly detectable when the winter state is disrupted, and changes in social task behaviors and social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment (brood) are induced. Likewise, we found that cellular senescence was induced by such social intervention. However, cellular senescence showed marked regional differences, suggesting that particular brain regions age slower than others. Finally, by preventing post-winter colonies from brood rearing, behavioral senescence became undetectable, even after transition to the usually short-lived phenotypes had occurred. We envision that social regulation of negligible functional senescence and highly dynamic accumulation of a universal symptom of cellular aging (lipofuscin) offers rewarding perspectives to target proximate mechanisms of slowed aging.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Cardiovascular Consequences of Childhood Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure: Prevailing Evidence, Burden, and Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although public health programs have led to a substantial decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoke exposure are by no means a thing of the past. In the United States, 4 of 10 school-aged children and 1 of 3 adolescents are involuntarily exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS), with children of minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in low-socioeconomic-status households being disproportionately affected (68% and 43%, respectively). Children are particularly vulnerable, with little control over home and social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, and lack the understanding, agency, and ability to avoid SHS exposure on their own volition; they also have physiological or behavioral characteristics that render them especially susceptible to effects of SHS. Side-stream smoke (the smoke emanating from the burning end of the cigarette), a major component of SHS, contains a higher concentration of some toxins than mainstream smoke (inhaled by the smoker directly), making SHS potentially as dangerous as or even more dangerous than direct smoking. Compelling animal and human evidence shows that SHS exposure during childhood is detrimental to arterial function and structure, resulting in premature atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular consequences. Childhood SHS exposure is also related to impaired cardiac autonomic function and changes in heart rate variability. In addition, childhood SHS exposure is associated with clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Individualized interventions to reduce childhood exposure to SHS are shown to be at least modestly effective, as are broader-based policy initiatives such as community smoking bans and increased taxation.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>The purpose of this statement is to summarize the available evidence on the cardiovascular health consequences of childhood SHS exposure; this will support ongoing efforts to further reduce and eliminate SHS exposure in this vulnerable population. This statement reviews relevant data from epidemiological studies, laboratory-based experiments, and controlled behavioral trials concerning SHS and cardiovascular disease risk in children. Information on the effects of SHS exposure on the cardiovascular system in animal and pediatric studies, including vascular disruption and platelet activation, oxidation and inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular stiffness, changes in vascular structure, and autonomic dysfunction, is examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The epidemiological, observational, and experimental evidence accumulated to date demonstrates the detrimental cardiovascular consequences of SHS exposure in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications:</title><p>Increased awareness of the adverse, lifetime cardiovascular consequences of childhood SHS may facilitate the development of innovative individual, family-centered, and community health interventions to reduce and ideally eliminate SHS exposure in the vulnerable pediatric population. This evidence calls for a robust public health policy that embraces zero tolerance of childhood SHS exposure.</p></sec>

Acclimation to Fluctuating Light Impacts the Rapidity of Response and Diurnal Rhythm of Stomatal Conductance<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>Plant acclimation to growth light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment has been studied extensively; however, the majority of these studies have focused on light intensity and photo-acclimation, with few studies exploring the impact of dynamic growth light on stomatal acclimation and behavior. To assess the impact of growth light regime on stomatal acclimation, we grew Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in three different lighting regimes (with the same average daily intensity), fluctuating with a fixed pattern of light, fluctuating with a randomized pattern of light (sinusoidal), and nonfluctuating (square wave), to assess the effect of light regime dynamics on gas exchange. We demonstrated that <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> (stomatal conductance to water vapor) acclimation is influenced by both intensity and light pattern, modifying the stomatal kinetics at different times of the day and resulting in differences in the rapidity and magnitude of the <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response. We also describe and quantify the response to an internal signal that uncouples variation in <i>A</i> and <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> over the majority of the diurnal period and represents 25% of the total diurnal <i>g<sub>s</sub></i>. This <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response can be characterized by a Gaussian element and when incorporated into the widely used Ball-Berry model greatly improved the prediction of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in a dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. From these findings, we conclude that acclimation of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> to growth light could be an important strategy for maintaining carbon fixation and overall plant water status and should be considered when inferring responses in the field from laboratory-based experiments.</p>

Suboptimal Acclimation of Photosynthesis to Light in Wheat Canopies<sup>[CC-BY]</sup>
<p>Photosynthetic acclimation (photoacclimation) is the process whereby leaves alter their morphology and/or biochemistry to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and productivity according to long-term changes in the light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. The three-dimensional architecture of plant canopies imposes complex light dynamics, but the drivers for photoacclimation in such fluctuating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments are poorly understood. A technique for high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction was combined with ray tracing to simulate a daily time course of radiation profiles for architecturally contrasting field-grown wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) canopies. An empirical model of photoacclimation was adapted to predict the optimal distribution of photosynthesis according to the fluctuating light patterns throughout the canopies. While the photoacclimation model output showed good correlation with field-measured gas-exchange data at the top of the canopy, it predicted a lower optimal light-saturated rate of photosynthesis at the base. Leaf Rubisco and protein contents were consistent with the measured optimal light-saturated rate of photosynthesis. We conclude that, although the photosynthetic capacity of leaves is high enough to exploit brief periods of high light within the canopy (particularly toward the base), the frequency and duration of such sunflecks are too small to make acclimation a viable strategy in terms of carbon gain. This suboptimal acclimation renders a large portion of residual photosynthetic capacity unused and reduces photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency at the canopy level, with further implications for photosynthetic productivity. It is argued that (1) this represents an untapped source of photosynthetic potential and (2) canopy nitrogen could be lowered with no detriment to carbon gain or grain protein content.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p>Drought stress is one of the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced water availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in water-limiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to drought stress through its control of stomatal aperture and water transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the drought tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are controlled by ubiquiti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong> involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by drought stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved water use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a controlled drought-stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the control of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel control point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield potential.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>Brachypodium</i> Links Vernalization and Flowering Time Loci as Major Flowering Determinants
<p>The domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favorable developmental traits, including flowering time, which resulted in the creation of varieties with altered growth habits. Research into the pathways underlying these growth habits in cereals has highlighted the role of three main flowering regulators: <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>VRN1</i>), <i>VRN2</i>, and <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>). Previous reverse genetic studies suggested that the roles of <i>VRN1</i> and <i>FT</i> are conserved in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> yet identified considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of <i>VRN2</i>. To investigate the natural diversity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ing flowering time pathways in a nondomesticated grass, the reference <i>B. distachyon</i> accession Bd21 was crossed with the vernalization-dependent accession ABR6. Resequencing of ABR6 allowed the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic map at the F4 stage of the mapping population. Flowering time was evaluated in F4:5 families in five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental conditions, and three major loci were found to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong> flowering time. Interestingly, two of these loci colocalize with the <i>B. distachyon</i> homologs of the major flowering pathway genes <i>VRN2</i> and <i>FT</i>, whereas no linkage was observed at <i>VRN1</i>. Characterization of these candidates identified sequence and expression variation between the two parental genotypes, which may explain the contrasting growth habits. However, the identification of additional quantitative trait loci suggests that greater complexity underlies flowering time in this nondomesticated system. Studying the interaction of these regulators in <i>B. distachyon</i> provides insights into the evolutionary context of flowering time regulation in the Poaceae as well as elucidates the way humans have utilized the natural variation present in grasses to create modern temperate cereals.</p>

Apparent Overinvestment in Leaf Venation Relaxes Leaf Morphological Constraints on Photosynthesis in Arid Habitats
<p>Leaf veins supply the mesophyll with water that evaporates when stomata are open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Theoretical analyses suggest that water is optimally distributed in the mesophyll when the lateral distance between veins (<i>d</i><sub>x</sub>) is equal to the distance from these veins to the epidermis (<i>d</i><sub>y</sub>), expressed as <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ≈ 1. Although this theory is supported by observations of many derived angiosperms, we hypothesize that plants in arid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments may reduce <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> below unity owing to climate-specific functional adaptations of increased leaf thickness and increased vein density. To test our hypothesis, we assembled leaf hydraulic, morphological, and photosynthetic traits of 68 species from the <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Corymbia</i> genera (termed eucalypts) along an aridity gradient in southwestern Australia. We inferred the potential gas-exchange advantage of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> using a model that links leaf morphology and hydraulics to photosynthesis. Our observations reveal that eucalypts in arid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments have thick amphistomatous leaves with high vein densities, resulting in <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ratios that range from 1.6 to 0.15 along the aridity gradient. Our model suggests that, as leaves become thicker, the effect of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> is to offset the reduction in leaf gas exchange that would result from maintaining <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> at unity. This apparent overinvestment in leaf ve<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nation</span></strong> may be explained from the selective pressure of aridity, under which traits associated with long leaf life span, high hydraulic and thermal capacitances, and high potential rates of leaf water transport confer a competitive advantage.</p>

Fitness Trade-Offs Lead to Suppressor Tolerance in Yeast
<p>Genetic variation among individuals within a population provides the raw material for phenotypic diversity upon which natural selection operates. Some given variants can act on multiple standing genomic variations simultaneously and release previously inaccessible phenotypes, leading to increased adaptive potential upon challenging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Previously, we identified such a variant related to a tRNA nonsense suppressor in yeast. When introduced into other genetic backgrounds, the suppressor led to an increased population phenotypic variance on various culture conditions, conferring background and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment specific selective advantages. Nonetheless, most isolates are intolerant to the suppressor on rich media due to a severe fitness cost. Here, we found that the tolerance to suppressor is related to a surprising level of fitness outburst, showing a trade-off effect to accommodate the cost of carrying the suppressor. To dissect the genetic basis of such trade-offs, we crossed strains with contrasting tolerance levels on rich media, and analyzed the fitness distribution patterns in the offspring. Combining quantitative tetrad analysis and bulk segregant analysis, we identified two genes, namely <i>MKT1</i> and <i>RGA1</i>, involved in suppressor tolerance. We showed that alleles from the tolerant parent for both genes conferred a significant gain of fitness, which increased the suppressor tolerance. Our results present a detailed dissection of suppressor tolerance in yeast and provide insights into the molecular basis of trade-offs between fitness and evolutionary potential.</p>

Phylogenetic Tools for Generalized HIV-1 Epidemics: Findings from the PANGEA-HIV Methods Comparison
<p>Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modeling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first 3 months of infection correlated with the true values (Pearson correlation > 90%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods’ development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.</p>

Natural Selection in the Great Apes
<p>Natural selection is crucial for the adaptation of populations to their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Here, we present the first global study of natural selection in the <i>Hominidae</i> (humans and great apes) based on genome-wide information from population samples representing all extant species (including most subspecies). Combining several neutrality tests we create a multi-species map of signatures of natural selection covering all major types of natural selection. We find that the estimated efficiency of both purifying and positive selection varies between species and is significantly correlated with their long-term effective population size. Thus, even the modest differences in population size among the closely related <i>Hominidae</i> lineages have resulted in differences in their ability to remove deleterious alleles and to adapt to changing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Most signatures of balancing and positive selection are species-specific, with signatures of balancing selection more often being shared among species. We also identify loci with evidence of positive selection across several lineages. Notably, we detect signatures of positive selection in several genes related to brain function, anatomy, diet and immune processes. Our results contribute to a better understanding of human evolution by putting the evidence of natural selection in humans within its larger evolutionary context.

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s on yield components explaining variations in bunch number, the number of fruits per bunch and oil dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>) describing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the number of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch number and the fruit number per bunch. Variations in bunch number per month were mainly due to variations in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, variations in fruit number per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the number of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and oil concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n at the control level, without any major decrease in the concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

ERK signaling pathway regulates sleep duration through activity-induced gene expression during wakefulness
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness is accompanied by experience-dependent synaptic plasticity and an increase in activity-regulated gene transcription. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>-induced genes are certainly markers of neuronal activity and may also directly regulate the du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n of and need for sleep. We stimulated murine cortical cultures with the neuromodulatory signals that are known to control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness in the brain and found that norepinephrine alone or a mixture of these neuromodulators induced activity-regulated gene transcription. Pharmacological inhibition of the various signaling pathways involved in the regulation of gene expression indicated that the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is the principal one mediating the effects of waking neuromodulators on gene expression. In mice, ERK phosphorylation in the cortex increased and decreased with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness and sleep. Whole-body or cortical neuron–specific deletion of <i>Erk1</i> or <i>Erk2</i> significantly increased the du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness in mice, and pharmacological inhibition of ERK phosphorylation decreased sleep du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n and increased the du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness bouts. Thus, this signaling pathway, which is highly conserved from <i>Drosophila</i> to mammals, is a key pathway that links waking experience–induced neuronal gene expression to sleep du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n and quality.</p>

The paraventricular thalamus is a critical thalamic area for wakefulness
<p>Clinical observations indicate that the paramedian region of the thalamus is a critical node for controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness. However, the specific nucleus and neural circuitry for this function remain unknown. Using in vivo fiber photometry or multichannel electrophysiological recordings in mice, we found that glutamatergic neurons of the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) exhibited high activities during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness. Suppression of PVT neuronal activity caused a reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness, whereas activation of PVT neurons induced a transition from sleep to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness and an accele<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n of emergence from general anesthesia. Moreover, our findings indicate that the PVT–nucleus accumbens projections and hypocretin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus to PVT glutamatergic neurons’ projections are the effector pathways for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness control. These results demonstrate that the PVT is a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness-controlling nucleus in the thalamus.</p>

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   alignment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   forces during static and dynamic weight-bearing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact forces and moments were measured in nine   patients with instrumented knee implants. Medial force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend). Hip-knee-ankle angles in the frontal plane were analysed   using full-leg coronal radiographs. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The medial force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> strongly correlated with the tibiofemoral   alignment in the static condition of one-legged stance (R² = 0.88)   and dynamic single-limb loading (R² = 0.59) with varus malalignment   leading to increased medial force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s of up to 88%. In contrast,   the correlation between leg alignment and magnitude of medial compartment force   was much less pronounced. A lateral shift of force occurred during   activities with double-limb support and higher knee flexion angles. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The medial force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> depends on both the tibiofemoral alignment   and the nature of the activity involved. It cannot be generalised   to a single value. Higher medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s during single-limb loading   are associated with varus malalignment in TKA. The current trend   towards a ‘constitutional varus’ after joint replacement, in terms   of overall tibiofemoral alignment, should be considered carefully   with respect to the increased medial force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:779–87.</p></sec>

Quantifying the ‘law of diminishing returns’ in magnetically controlled growing rods
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) allow non-invasive   correction of the spinal deformity in the treatment of early-onset   scoliosis. Conventional growing rod systems (CGRS) need repeated   surgical distractions: these are associated with the effect of the   ‘law of diminishing returns’.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to quantify this effect in   MCGRs over sequential distractions. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 35 patients with a maximum follow-up of 57 months   were included in the study. There were 17 boys and 18 girls with   a mean age of 7.4 years (2 to 14). True Distraction (TD) was determined   by measuring the expansion gap on fluoroscopy. This was compared   with Intended Distraction (ID) and expressed as the ‘T/I’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>.   The T/I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> and the Cobb angle were calculated at several time   points during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 30 months (6 to 57). There was a significant   decrease in the mean T/I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> over time (convex rod at 3 months   0.81, <sc>sd</sc> 0.58 <i>vs</i> 51 months 0.17, <sc>sd </sc>0.16,    p = 0.0001; concave rod at 3 months 0.93, <sc>sd</sc> 0.67 <i>vs</i> 51   months 0.18, <sc>sd</sc> 0.15, p = 0.0001).

The sleep-wake cycle regulates brain interstitial fluid tau in mice and CSF tau in humans
<p>The sleep-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong> cycle regulates interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of β-amyloid (Aβ) that accumulates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Furthermore, chronic sleep deprivation (SD) increases Aβ plaques. However, tau, not Aβ, accumulation appears to drive AD neurodegene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n. We tested whether ISF/CSF tau and tau seeding and spreading were influenced by the sleep-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong> cycle and SD. Mouse ISF tau was increased ~90% during normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness versus sleep and ~100% during SD. Human CSF tau also increased more than 50% during SD. In a tau seeding-and-spreading model, chronic SD increased tau pathology spreading. Chemogenetically driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness in mice also significantly increased both ISF Aβ and tau. Thus, the sleep-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong> cycle regulates ISF tau, and SD increases ISF and CSF tau as well as tau pathology spreading.</p>

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital volume is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission volume, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case volume, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome measures were (1) process measures at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study these associations with hospital volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-volume hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process measures than higher-volume hospitals. Higher hospital volume was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher volumes with lower 6-month mortality (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective national quality improvement registry of older patients with HF indicates that hospital volume as a structural metric correlates with process measures, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up. Hospital profiling should focus on participation in systems of care, adherence to process metrics, and risk-standardized outcomes rather than on hospital volume itself.</p></sec>

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging metabolic theory of pulmonary hypertension (PH) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (PH-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, accompanied by an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these metabolic alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>ns in PH-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in PH-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, which promotes glycolysis and prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe PH (PH-Fibs) and from normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; resto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. Metabolic products were determined by mass spectrometry–based metabolomics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> in PH-Fibs compared with normal subjects. PKM2 inhibition reversed the glycolytic status of PH-Fibs, decreased their cell prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n, and attenuated macrophage interleukin-1β expression. Furthermore, normalizing the PKM2/PKM1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> in PH-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown reversed the glycolytic phenotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n. Pharmacological manipulation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In PH, miR-124, through the alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, the overall metabolic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells. This PH phenotype can be rescued with interventions at various levels of the metabolic cascade. These findings suggest a more integrated view of vascular cell metabolism, which may open unique therapeutic prospects in targeting the dynamic glycolytic and mitochondrial interactions and between mesenchymal inflammatory cells in PH.</p></sec>

Specialized Adult Congenital Heart Disease Care
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Clinical guidelines recommend specialized care for adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients. In reality, few patients receive such dedicated care. We sought to examine the impact of specialized care on ACHD patient mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined referral rates to specialized ACHD centers and ACHD patient mortality rates between 1990 and 2005 in the population-based Quebec Congenital Heart Disease database (n=71 467). This period covers several years before and after the publication of guidelines endorsing specialized care for ACHD patients. A time-series design, based on Joinpoint and Poisson regression analyses, was used to assess the changes in annual referral and patient mortality rates. The association between specialized ACHD care and all-cause mortality was assessed in both case–control and cohort studies. The time-series analysis demonstrated a significant increase in referral rates to specialized ACHD centers in 1997 (rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, +7.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], +6.6% to +8.2%). In parallel, a significant reduction in expected ACHD patient mortality was observed after year 2000 (rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, −5.0%;95% CI, −10.8% to −0.8%). In exploratory post hoc cohort and case–control analyses, specialized ACHD care was independently associated with reduced mortality (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.94) and a reduced odds of death (adjusted odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.08–0.97), respectively.

Long-Term Safety and Effectiveness of Mechanical Versus Biologic Aortic Valve Prostheses in Older Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>There is a paucity of long-term data comparing biological versus mechanical aortic valve prostheses in older individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed follow-up of patients aged 65 to 80 years undergoing aortic valve replacement with a biological (n=24 410) or mechanical (n=14 789) prosthesis from 1991 to 1999 at 605 centers within the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database using Medicare inpatient claims (mean, 12.6 years; maximum, 17 years; minimum, 8 years), and outcomes were compared by propensity methods. Among Medicare-linked patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (mean age, 73 years), both reope<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n (4.0%) and endocarditis (1.9%) were uncommon to 12 years; however, the risk for other adverse outcomes was high, including death (66.5%), stroke (14.1%), and bleeding (17.9%). Compared with those receiving a mechanical valve, patients given a bioprosthesis had a similar adjusted risk for death (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.07), higher risks for reope<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 2.14–3.03) and endocarditis (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–1.94), and lower risks for stroke (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.93) and bleeding (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.70).

Revealing the subfemtosecond dynamics of orbital angular momentum in nanoplasmonic vortices
<p>The ability of light to carry and deliver orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the form of optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vortic</span></strong>es has attracted much interest. The physical properties of light with a helical wavefront can be confined onto two-dimensional surfaces with subwavelength dimensions in the form of plasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vortic</span></strong>es, opening avenues for thus far unknown light-matter interactions. Because of their extreme rotational velocity, the ultrafast dynamics of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vortic</span></strong>es remained unexplored. Here we show the detailed spatiotemporal evolution of nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vortic</span></strong>es using time-resolved two-photon photoemission electron microscopy. We observe both long- and short-range plasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vortic</span></strong>es confined to deep subwavelength dimensions on the scale of 100 nanometers with nanometer spatial resolution and subfemtosecond time-step resolution. Finally, by measuring the angular velocity of the vortex, we directly extract the OAM magnitude of light.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Oral Anticoagulation in Very Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants (OACs) is the cornerstone for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data about the use of OACs among patients ≥90 years of age are limited. We aimed to investigate the risk of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the net clinical benefit of OAC treatment for very elderly patients with AF (≥90 years of age).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were compared between 11 064 and 14 658 patients with and without AF ≥90 years of age without antithrombotic therapy from 1996 to 2011. Patients with AF (n=15 756) were divided into 3 groups (no treatment, antiplatelet agents, and warfarin), and the risks of stroke and ICH were analyzed. The risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were further compared between patients treated with warfarin and nonvitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) from 2012 to 2015 when NOACs were available in Taiwan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with patients without AF, patients with AF had an increased risk of ischemic stroke (event number/patient number, incidence = 742/11 064, 5.75%/y versus 1399/14 658, 3.00%/y; hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.74–2.14) and similar risk of ICH (131/11 064, 0.97%/y versus 206/14 658, 0.54%/y; hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.09) in competing risk analysis for mortality. Among patients with AF, warfarin use was associated with a lower stroke risk (39/617, 3.83%/y versus 742/11 064, 5.75%/y; hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.96 in a competing risk model), with no difference in ICH risk compared with nontreatment. When compared with no antithrombotic therapy or antiplatelet drugs, warfarin was associated with a positive net clinical benefit. These findings persisted in propensity-matched analyses. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were associated with a lower risk of ICH (4/978, 0.42%/y versus 19/768, 1.63%/y; hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.10–0.97 in a competing risk model), with no difference in risk of ischemic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with AF ≥90 years of age, warfarin was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke and positive net clinical benefit. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were associated with a lower risk of ICH. Thus, OACs may still be considered as thromboprophylaxis for elderly patients, with NOACs being the more favorable choice.</p></sec>

The primary study end point was time to death or cardiac transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 80 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a median age at diagnosis of 0.48 (interquartile range, 0.1, 2.5) years. Freedom from death/transplantation was 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.0–92.0) 1 year after presentation, 80% (95% CI, 69.0–87.0) at 10 years, and 78% (95% CI, 67.0–86.0) at 20 years. From multivariable analyses, risk factors for death/transplantation included symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of diagnosis (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.60–11.05; <i>P</i>=0.004), Noonan syndrome (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.02–8.08; <i>P</i>=0.045), higher posterior wall thickness <i>z</i> score (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.22–1.73; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower fractional shortening <i>z</i> score (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74–0.95; <i>P</i>=0.005) during follow-up. Nineteen (23%) subjects underwent left ventricular myectomy. At a median of 15.7 years of follow-up, 27 (42%) of 63 survivors were treated with β-blocker, and 13 (21%) had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The highest risk of death or transplantation for children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is within 1 year after diagnosis, with low attrition rates thereafter.

Duct Stenting Versus Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt in Neonates With Duct-Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Infants born with cardiac abnormalities causing dependence on the arterial duct for pulmonary blood flow are often palliated with a shunt usually between the subclavian artery and either pulmonary artery. A so-called modified Blalock-Taussig shunt allows progress through early life to an age and weight at which repair or further more stable palliation can be safely achieved. Modified Blalock-Taussig shunts continue to present concern for postprocedural instability and early mortality such that other alternatives continue to be explored. Duct stenting (DS) is emerging as one such alternative with potential for greater early stability and improved survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The purpose of this study was to compare postprocedural outcomes and survival to next-stage palliative or reparative surgery between patients undergoing a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS in infants with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow. All patients undergoing cardiac surgery and congenital interventions in the United Kingdom are prospectively recruited to an externally validated national outcome audit. From this audit, participating UK centers identified infants <30 days of age undergoing either a Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS for cardiac conditions with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow between January 2012 and December 31, 2015. One hundred seventy-one patients underwent a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, and in 83 patients, DS was attempted. Primary and secondary outcomes of survival and need for extracorporeal support were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Longer-term mortality before repair and reintervention were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression. All multivariable analyses accommodated a propensity score to balance patient characteristics between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There was an early (to discharge) survival advantage for infants before next-stage surgery in the DS group (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 4.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.37–13.14; <i>P</i>=0.012). There was also a difference in the need for postprocedural extracorporeal support in favor of the DS group (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.058). Longer-term survival outcomes showed a reduced risk of death before repair in the DS group (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.85; <i>P</i>=0.026) but a slightly increased risk of reintervention (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–2.64; <i>P</i>=0.165).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>DS is emerging as a preferred alternative to a surgical shunt for neonatal palliation with evidence for greater postprocedural stability and improved patient survival to destination surgical treatment.</p></sec>

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a genetic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other diseases. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were associated with coronary heart disease using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial disease (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006). In a mediation analysis, the effect of the genetic score on decreased coronary heart disease risk extended beyond its effect on blood pressure. Conversely, rare variants that inactivate the <i>NOS3</i> or <i>GUCY1A3</i> genes were associated with a 23 mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (95% CI, 12-34; <i>P</i>=5.6*10<sup>–5</sup>) and a 3-fold higher risk of coronary heart disease (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.29-7.12; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling is associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke. Pharmacological stimulation of nitric oxide signaling may prove useful in the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec>

Time to Epinephrine Administration and Survival From Nonshockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Among Children and Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that earlier epinephrine administ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n is associated with improved survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable initial rhythms. However, the effect of epinephrine timing on patients with nonshockable initial rhythms is unclear. The objective of this study was to measure the association between time to epinephrine administ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n and survival in adults and children with emergency medical services (EMS)–treated OHCA with nonshockable initial rhythms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of OHCAs prospectively identified by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium network from June 4, 2011, to June 30, 2015. We included patients of all ages with an EMS-treated OHCA and an initial nonshockable rhythm. We excluded those with return of spontaneous circulation in <10 minutes. We conducted a subgroup analysis involving patients <18 years of age. The primary exposure was time (minutes) from arrival of the first EMS agency to the first dose of epinephrine. Secondary exposure was time to epinephrine dichotomized as early (<10 minutes) or late (≥10 minutes). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. We adjusted for Utstein covariates and Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium study site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 55 568 EMS-treated OHCAs, 32 101 patients with initial nonshockable rhythms were included.

After adjusting for potential confounders, each minute from EMS arrival to epinephrine administ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n was associated with a 4% decrease in odds of survival for adults, odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>=0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.98).

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease

The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of diagnosis of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-intensity statins with lower amputation and death risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-intensity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-based study to show that high-intensity statin use at the time of PAD diagnosis is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and mortality in comparison with low-to-moderate–intensity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as well.</p></sec>

Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction and Myocardial Injury

Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) and noncardiovascular death. To explore competing risks, cause-specific hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s were obtained using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The adjudicated index diagnosis was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively. At 5 years, all-cause death rates were higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (62.5%) or myocardial injury (72.4%) compared with type 1 myocardial infarction (36.7%). The majority of excess deaths in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were because of noncardiovascular causes (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.92–2.81 versus type 1 myocardial infarction).

Participants 45 to 64 years of age in ARIC (men=6479, women=8488) and REGARDS (men=5296, women=7822), and ≥65 years of age in CHS (men=1836, women=2790) and REGARDS (men=3381, women=4112), all without a history of CHD, were analyzed. Fatal and nonfatal CHD incidence was assessed from baseline (ARIC=1987–1989, CHS=1989–1990, REGARDS=2003–2007) through up to 11 years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Age-adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s comparing black versus white men 45 to 64 years of age in ARIC and REGARDS were 2.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.42–3.06) and 2.11 (1.32–3.38), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 0.82 (0.64–1.05) and 0.94 (0.69–1.28), respectively, for nonfatal CHD. After adjustment for social determinants of health and cardiovascular risk factors, hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s in ARIC and REGARDS were 1.19 (95% confidence interval, 0.74–1.92) and 1.09 (0.62–1.93), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 0.64 (0.47–0.86) and 0.67 (0.48–0.95), respectively, for nonfatal CHD.

Body Mass Index and Mortality Among Adults Undergoing Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In an apparent paradox, morbidity and mortality are lower in obese patients undergoing cardiac surgery, although the nature of this association is unclear. We sought to determine whether the obesity paradox observed in cardiac surgery is attributable to reverse epidemiology, bias, or confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the National Adult Cardiac Surgery registry for all cardiac surgical procedures performed between April 2002 and March 2013 were extracted. A parallel systematic review and meta-analysis (MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library) through June 2015 were also accomplished. Exposure of interest was body mass index categorized into 6 groups according to the World Health Organization classification.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 401 227 adult patients in the cohort study and 557 720 patients in the systematic review were included. A U-shaped association between mortality and body mass index classes was observed in both studies, with lower mortality in overweight (adjusted odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.83) and obese class I and II (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.86; and odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.94) patients relative to normal-weight patients and increased mortality in underweight individuals (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.41–1.62). In the cohort study, a U-shaped relationship was observed for stroke and low cardiac output syndrome but not for renal replacement therapy or deep sternal wound infection. Counter to the reverse epidemiology hypotheses, the protective effects of obesity were less in patients with severe chronic renal, lung, or cardiac disease and greater in older patients and in those with complications of obesity, including the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. Adjustments for important confounders did not alter our results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Obesity is associated with lower risks after cardiac surgery, with consistent effects noted in multiple analyses attempting to address residual confounding and reverse causation.</p></sec>

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart disease, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart disease (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart disease (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

Impact of Computed Tomography Perfusion Imaging on the Response to Tenecteplase in Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We pooled 2 clinical trials of tenecteplase compared with alteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, 1 that demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase and the other that showed no difference between the treatments in patient clinical outcomes. We tested the hypotheses that reperfusion therapy with tenecteplase would be superior to alteplase in improving functional outcomes in the group of patients with target mismatch as identified with advanced imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated whether tenecteplase-treated patients had a different 24-hour reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and a favorable odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 1 versus 2 to 6 compared with alteplase-treated patients using linear regression to generate odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s. Imaging outcomes included rates of vessel recanalization and infarct growth at 24 hours and occurrence of large parenchymal hematoma. Baseline computed tomography perfusion was analyzed to assess whether patients met the target mismatch criteria (absolute mismatch volume >15 mL, mismatch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> >1.8, baseline ischemic core <70 mL, and volume of severely hypoperfused tissue <100 mL). Patients meeting target mismatch criteria were analyzed as a subgroup to identify whether they had different treatment responses from the pooled group.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 146 pooled patients, 71 received alteplase and 75 received tenecteplase. Tenecteplase-treated patients had greater early clinical improvement (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score change: tenecteplase, 7; alteplase, 2; <i>P</i>=0.018) and less parenchymal hematoma (2 of 75 versus 10 of 71; <i>P</i>=0.02). The pooled group did not show improved patient outcomes when treated with tenecteplase (modified Rankin scale score 0–1: odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–3.51; <i>P</i>=0.102) compared with alteplase therapy. However, in patients with target mismatch (33 tenecteplase, 35 alteplase), treatment with tenecteplase was associated with greater early clinical improvement (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score change: tenecteplase, 6; alteplase, 1; <i>P</i><0.001) and better late independent recovery (modified Rankin scale score 0–1: odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 2.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–5.94; <i>P</i>=0.032) than those treated with alteplase.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tenecteplase may offer an improved efficacy and safety profile compared with alteplase, benefits possibly exaggerated in patients with baseline computed tomography perfusion–defined target mismatch.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Regist<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Cardiovascular death at 30 days occurred in 221 of 9155 patients (2.4%) randomized to thrombus aspi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n and 262 of 9151 (2.9%) randomized to PCI alone (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.06).

Multimodality Strategy for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment among adults without known CVD are limited by suboptimal performance and a narrow focus on only atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). We hypothesized that a strategy combining promising biomarkers across multiple different testing modalities would improve global and atherosclerotic CVD risk assessment among individuals without known CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) (n=6621) and the Dallas Heart Study (n=2202) who were free from CVD and underwent measurement of left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Associations of test results with the global composite CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary or peripheral revascularization, incident heart failure, or atrial fibrillation) and ASCVD (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) were assessed over >10 years of follow-up. Multivariable analyses for the primary global CVD end point adjusted for traditional risk factors plus statin use and creatinine (base model).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each test result was independently associated with global composite CVD events in MESA after adjustment for the components of the base model and the other test results (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). When the 5 tests were added to the base model, the c-statistic improved from 0.74 to 0.79 (<i>P</i>=0.001), significant integrated discrimination improvement (0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.08, <i>P</i><0.001) and category free net reclassification improvement (0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–0.56; <i>P</i>=0.003) were observed, and the model was well calibrated (χ<sup>2</sup>=12.2, <i>P</i>=0.20). Using a simple integer score counting the number of abnormal tests, compared with those with a score of 0, global CVD risk was increased among participants with a score of 1 (adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6), 2 (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.3–4.4), 3 (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.4–6.5), and ≥4 (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 7.5; 95% CI, 5.2–10.6).

Cardiac Outcomes After Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Insulin resistance is highly prevalent among patients with atherosclerosis and is associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. The IRIS trial (Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke) demonstrated that pioglitazone decreased the composite risk for fatal or nonfatal stroke and MI in patients with insulin resistance without diabetes mellitus, after a recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. The type and severity of cardiac events in this population and the impact of pioglitazone on these events have not been described.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of the effects of pioglitazone, in comparison with placebo, on acute coronary syndromes (MI and unstable angina) among IRIS participants. All potential acute coronary syndrome episodes were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an independent clinical events committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study cohort was composed of 3876 IRIS participants, mean age 63 years, 65% male, 89% white race, and 12% with a history of coronary artery disease. Over a median follow-up of 4.8 years, there were 225 acute coronary syndrome events, including 141 MIs and 84 episodes of unstable angina. The MIs included 28 (19%) with ST-segment elevation. The majority of MIs were type 1 (94, 65%), followed by type 2 (45, 32%). Serum troponin was 10× to 100× upper limit of normal in 49 (35%) and >100× upper limit of normal in 39 (28%). Pioglitazone reduced the risk of acute coronary syndrome (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.54–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.02).

Transplantation-Free Survival and Interventions at 3 Years in the Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>In the Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) trial, 1-year transplantation-free survival was better for the Norwood procedure with right ventricle–to–pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS) compared with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS). At 3 years, we compared transplantation-free survival, echocardiographic right ventricular ejection fraction, and unplanned interventions in the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Vital status and medical history were ascertained from annual medical records, death indexes, and phone interviews. The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial. Transplantation-free survival for the RVPAS versus MBTS groups did not differ at 3 years (67% versus 61%; <i>P</i>=0.15) or with all available follow-up of 4.8±1.1 years (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.14). Pre-Fontan right ventricular ejection fraction was lower in the RVPAS group than in the MBTS group (41.7<i>±</i>5.1% versus 44.7<i>±</i>6.0%; <i>P</i>=0.007), and right ventricular ejection fraction deteriorated in RVPAS (<i>P</i>=0.004) but not MBTS (<i>P</i>=0.40) subjects (pre-Fontan minus 14-month mean, −3.25±8.24% versus 0.99±8.80%; <i>P</i>=0.009). The RVPAS versus MBTS treatment effect had nonproportional hazards (<i>P</i>=0.004); the hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> favored the RVPAS before 5 months (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>=0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.88) but the MBTS beyond 1 year (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>=2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–4.62).

Survey of a Protocol to Increase Appropriate Implementation of Dispatcher-Assisted Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR) attempts to improve the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by laypersons who are unable to recognize cardiac arrest and are unfamiliar with CPR. Therefore, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of our new DA-CPR protocol for achieving implementation of bystander CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims not already receiving bystander CPR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Since 2007, we have applied a new DA-CPR protocol that uses supplementary key words. Fire departments prospectively collected baseline data on DA-CPR from January 2009 to December 2011. DA-CPR was attempted in 2747 patients; of these, 417 (15.2%) did not experience cardiac arrest. The sensitivity and specificity of the 2007 protocol versus estimated values of the previous standard protocol were 72.9% versus 50.3% and 99.6% versus 99.8%, respectively. We identified key words that may be useful for detecting out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the occurrence of cardiac arrest after an emergency call (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 16.85) and placing an emergency call away from the scene of the arrest (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 11.04) were potentially associated with failure to provide DA-CPR. Furthermore, at-home cardiac arrest (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.61) and family members as bystanders (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.55) were associated with bystander noncompliance with DA-CPR. No complications were reported in the 417 patients who received DA-CPR but did not have cardiac arrest.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Our 2007 protocol is safe and highly specific and may be more sensitive than the standard protocol. Understanding the factors associated with failure of bystanders to provide DA-CPR and implementing public education are necessary to increase the benefit of DA-CPR.</p></sec>

Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow test kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow test kit for the diagnosis of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion criteria were all clinical studies where the diagnosis   of PJI was uncertain. All studies selected used the Musculoskeletal   Infection Society (MSIS) or modified MSIS criteria. Two independent   reviewers reviewed the studies and extracted data. A meta-analysis   of results was carried out: pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive   and negative likelihood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, heterogeneity and areas under curves   are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ten studies (759 patients) were included. Of these, seven studies   (640 patients) evaluated the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay   and three (119 patients) the lateral flow test. The pooled sensitivity   and specificity of the qualitative α-defensin laboratory immunoassay   was 0.953 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.984) and 0.965 (95%   CI 0.943 to 0.979) respectively. The pooled positive likelihood   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> (PLR) and negative likelihood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> (NLR) were 34.86 (95%   CI 19.34 to 62.85) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.11). The pooled sensitivity   and specificity of the lateral flow test were 0.774 (95% CI 0.637   to 0.870) and 0.913 (95% CI 0.828 to 0.958), respectively. The pooled   PLR and NLR were 8.675 (95% CI 4.229 to 17.794) and 0.248 (95% CI   0.147 to 0.418), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the lateral flow test   were lower than those of the   α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay test. Hence, care must be   taken with interpretation of the lateral flow test when relying   on its results for the intra-operative diagnosis of PJI.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:66–72.</p></sec>

Comparison of Reduced-Dose Prasugrel and Standard-Dose Clopidogrel in Elderly Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes Undergoing Early Percutaneous Revascularization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elderly patients are at elevated risk of both ischemic and bleeding complications after an acute coronary syndrome and display higher on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity compared with younger patients. Prasugrel 5 mg provides more predictable platelet inhibition compared with clopidogrel in the elderly, suggesting the possibility of reducing ischemic events without increasing bleeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded end point trial, we compared a once-daily maintenance dose of prasugrel 5 mg with the standard clopidogrel 75 mg in patients >74 years of age with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The primary end point was the composite of mortality, myocardial infarction, disabling stroke, and rehospitalization for cardiovascular causes or bleeding within 1 year. The study was designed to demonstrate superiority of prasugrel 5 mg over clopidogrel 75 mg.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enrollment was interrupted, according to prespecified criteria, after a planned interim analysis, when 1443 patients (40% women; mean age, 80 years) had been enrolled with a median follow-up of 12 months, because of futility for efficacy. The primary end point occurred in 121 patients (17%) with prasugrel and 121 (16.6%) with clopidogrel (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.007; 95% confidence interval, 0.78–1.30; <i>P</i>=0.955). Definite/probable stent thrombosis rates were 0.7% with prasugrel versus 1.9% with clopidogrel (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.13–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.06).

Long-Term Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Women Who Have Had Infants With Heart Defects
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The possibility that congenital heart defects signal a familial predisposition to cardiovascular disease has not been investigated. We aimed to determine whether the risk of cardiovascular disorders later in life was higher for women who have had newborns with congenital heart defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied a cohort of 1 084 251 women who had delivered infants between 1989 and 2013 in Quebec, Canada. We identified women whose infants had critical, noncritical, or no heart defects, and tracked the women over time for future hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease, with follow-up extending up to 25 years past pregnancy. We calculated the incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization per 1000 person-years, and used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between infant heart defects and risk of maternal cardiovascular hospitalization. Models were adjusted for age, parity, preeclampsia, comorbidity, material deprivation, and time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Women whose infants had heart defects had a higher overall incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization. There were 3.38 cardiovascular hospitalizations per 1000 person-years for those with critical defects (95% CI, 2.67–4.27), 3.19 for noncritical defects (95% CI, 2.96–3.45), and 2.42 for no heart defects (95% CI, 2.39–2.44). In comparison with no heart defects, women whose infants had critical defects had a hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.13–1.82) for any cardiovascular hospitalization, and women whose infants had noncritical defects had a hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.15–1.34), in adjusted models. Risks of specific causes of cardiovascular hospitalization, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, and other atherosclerotic disorders, were also greater for mothers of infants with congenital heart defects than with no defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Women whose infants have congenital heart defects have a greater risk of cardiovascular hospitalization later in life. Congenital heart defects in offspring may be an early marker of predisposition to cardiovascular disease.</p></sec>

Six-Year Changes in Physical Activity and the Risk of Incident Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher physical activity (PA) is associated with lower heart failure (HF) risk; however, the effect of changes in PA on HF risk is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We evaluated 11 351 ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) participants (mean age 60 years) who attended visit 3 (1993–1995) and did not have a history of cardiovascular disease. Exercise PA was assessed using a modified Baecke questionnaire and categorized according to American Heart Association guidelines as recommended, intermediate, or poor. We used Cox regression models to characterize the association of 6-year changes in PA between the first (1987–1989) and third ARIC visits and HF risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During a median of 19 years of follow-up, 1750 HF events occurred. Compared with those with poor activity at both visits, the lowest HF risk was seen for those with persistently recommended activity (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.60–0.80). However, those whose PA increased from poor to recommended also had reduced HF risk (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.77; 95% confidence interval 0.63–0.93). Among participants with poor baseline activity, each 1 SD higher PA at 6 years (512.5 METS*minutes/week, corresponding to ≈30 minutes of brisk walking 4 times per week) was associated with significantly lower future HF risk (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.89, 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.96).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although maintaining recommended activity levels is associated with the lowest HF risk, initiating and increasing PA, even in late middle age, are also linked to lower HF risk. Augmenting PA may be an important component of strategies to prevent HF.</p></sec>

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart disease mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract.

Angiography Versus Hemodynamics to Predict the Natural History of Coronary Stenoses
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Among patients with documented stable coronary artery disease and in whom no revascularization was performed, we compared the respective values of angiographic diameter stenosis (DS) and fractional flow reserve (FFR) in predicting natural history.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The present analysis included the 607 patients from the FAME 2 trial (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography in Multivessel Evaluation 2) in whom no revascularization was performed. FFR varied from 0.20 to 1.00 (average 0.74±0.16), and DS (by quantitative coronary analysis) varied from 8% to 98% (average 53±15). The primary end point, defined as vessel-oriented clinical end point (VOCE) at 2 years, was a composite of prospectively adjudicated cardiac death, vessel-related myocardial infarction, vessel-related urgent, and not urgent revascularization. The stenoses were divided into 4 groups according to FFR and %DS values: positive concordance (FFR≤0.80; DS≥50%), negative concordance (FFR>0.80; DS<50%), positive mismatch (FFR≤0.80; DS<50%), and negative mismatch (FFR>0.80; DS≥50%).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rate of VOCE was highest in the positive concordance group (log rank: X<sup>2</sup>=80.96; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lowest in the negative concordance group.

Effect of Intensive Blood Pressure Lowering on Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in Patients With Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is currently unknown whether intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering beyond that recommended would lead to more lowering of the risk of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with hypertension and whether reducing the risk of LVH explains the reported cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefits of intensive BP lowering in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This analysis included 8164 participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 35.3% women; 31.2% blacks) with hypertension but no diabetes mellitus from the SPRINT trial (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial): 4086 randomly assigned to intensive BP lowering (target SBP <120 mm Hg) and 4078 assigned to standard BP lowering (target SBP <140 mm Hg). Progression and regression of LVH as defined by Cornell voltage criteria derived from standard 12-lead ECGs recorded at baseline and biannually were compared between treatment arms during a median follow-up of 3.81 years. The effect of intensive (versus standard) BP lowering on the SPRINT primary CVD outcome (a composite of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart failure, and CVD death) was compared before and after adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among SPRINT participants without baseline LVH (n=7559), intensive (versus standard) BP lowering was associated with a 46% lower risk of developing LVH (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>=0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.68). Similarly, among SPRINT participants with baseline LVH (n=605, 7.4%), those assigned to the intensive (versus standard) BP lowering were 66% more likely to regress/improve their LVH (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>=1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.11). Adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate did not substantially attenuate the effect of intensive BP therapy on CVD events (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of intensive versus standard BP lowering on CVD, 0.76 [95% confidence interval, 0.64–0.90] and 0.77 [95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.91] before and after adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with hypertension but no diabetes mellitus, intensive BP lowering (target systolic BP <120 mm Hg) compared with standard BP lowering (target systolic BP <140 mm Hg) resulted in lower rates of developing new LVH in those without LVH and higher rates of regression of LVH in those with existing LVH.

Genetic Obesity and the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies have identified an association between body mass index (BMI) and incident atrial fibrillation (AF). Inferring causality from observational studies, however, is subject to residual confounding, reverse causation, and bias. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the causal association between BMI and AF by using genetic predictors of BMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified 51 646 individuals of European ancestry without AF at baseline from 7 prospective population-based cohorts initiated between 1987 and 2002 in the United States, Iceland, and the Netherlands with incident AF ascertained between 1987 and 2012. Cohort-specific mean follow-up ranged from 7.4 to 19.2 years, over which period there was a total of 4178 cases of incident AF. We performed a Mendelian randomization with instrumental variable analysis to estimate a cohort-specific causal hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> for the association between BMI and AF. Two genetic instruments for BMI were used: <i>FTO</i> genotype (rs1558902) and a BMI gene score comprising 39 single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified by genome-wide association studies to be associated with BMI. Cohort-specific estimates were combined by random-effects, inverse variance–weighted meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In age- and sex-adjusted meta-analysis, both genetic instruments were significantly associated with BMI (<i>FTO</i>: 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.32–0.54] kg/m<sup>2</sup> per A-allele, <i>P</i><0.001; BMI gene score: 1.05 [95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.20] kg/m<sup>2</sup> per 1-U increase, <i>P</i><0.001) and incident AF (<i>FTO</i>, hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.07 [1.02–1.11] per A-allele, <i>P</i>=0.004; BMI gene score, hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.11 [1.05–1.18] per 1-U increase, <i>P</i><0.001). Age- and sex-adjusted instrumental variable estimates for the causal association between BMI and incident AF were hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.15 (1.04–1.26) per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i>=0.005 (<i>FTO</i>) and 1.11 (1.05–1.17) per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i><0.001 (BMI gene score).

Low-Dose Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The long-term efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are still inconclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The JPAD trial (Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis With Aspirin for Diabetes) was a randomized, open-label, standard care–controlled trial examining whether low-dose aspirin affected cardiovascular events in 2539 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without preexisting cardiovascular disease. Patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily; aspirin group) or no aspirin (no-aspirin group) in the JPAD trial. After that trial ended in 2008, we followed up with the patients until 2015, with no attempt to change the previously assigned therapy. Primary end points were cardiovascular events, including sudden death, fatal or nonfatal coronary artery disease, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. For the safety analysis, hemorrhagic events, consisting of gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, and bleeding from any other sites, were also analyzed. The primary analysis was conducted for cardiovascular events among patients who retained their original allocation (a per-protocol cohort).

Low-dose aspirin did not reduce cardiovascular events in the per-protocol cohort (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.42). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, sex, glycemic control, kidney function, smoking status, hypertension, and dyslipidemia showed similar results (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.30), with no heterogeneity of efficacy in subgroup analyses stratified by each of these factors (all interaction <i>P</i>>0.05). Sensitivity analyses on the intention-to-treat cohort yielded consistent results (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.25). Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 25 patients (2%) in the aspirin group and 12 (0.9%) in the no-aspirin group (<i>P</i>=0.03), and the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke was not different between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Low-dose aspirin did not affect the risk for cardiovascular events but increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a primary prevention setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Regist<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Sex Differences in 1-Year All-Cause Rehospitalization in Patients After Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with men, women are at higher risk of rehospitalization in the first month after discharge for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, it is unknown whether this risk extends to the full year and varies by age. Explanatory factors potentially mediating the relationship between sex and rehospitalization remain unexplored and are needed to reduce readmissions. The aim of this study was to assess sex differences and factors associated with 1-year rehospitalization rates after AMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We recruited 3536 patients (33% women) ≥18 years of age hospitalized with AMI from 24 US centers into the TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients’ Health Status). Data were obtained by medical record abstraction and patient interviews, and a physician panel adjudicated hospitalizations within the first year after AMI. We compared sex differences in rehospitalization using a Cox proportional hazards model, following sequential adjustment for covariates and testing for an age-sex interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One-year crude all-cause rehospitalization rates for women were significantly higher than men after AMI (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.29 for women; 95% confidence interval, 1.12−1.48). After adjustment for demographics and clinical factors, women had a persistent 26% higher risk of rehospitalization (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.08−1.47). However, after adjustment for health status and psychosocial factors (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.96−1.35), the association was attenuated. No significant age-sex interaction was found for 1-year rehospitalization, suggesting that the increased risk applied to both older and younger women.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Regardless of age, women have a higher risk of rehospitalization compared with men over the first year after AMI. Although the increased risk persisted after adjustment for clinical factors, the poorer health and psychosocial state of women attenuated the difference.</p></sec>

Treatment With Tissue Plasminogen Activator in the Golden Hour and the Shape of the 4.5-Hour Time-Benefit Curve in the National United States Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier tissue plasminogen activator treatment improves ischemic stroke outcome, but aspects of the time-benefit relationship still not well delineated are: (1) the degree of additional benefit accrued with treatment in the first 60 minutes after onset, and (2) the shape of the time-benefit curve through 4.5 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed patients who had acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4.5 hours of onset from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke US national program. Onset-to-treatment time was analyzed as a continuous, potentially nonlinear variable and as a categorical variable comparing patients treated within 60 minutes of onset with later epochs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 65 384 tissue plasminogen activator–treated patients, the median onset-to-treatment time was 141 minutes (interquartile range, 110–173) and 878 patients (1.3%) were treated within the first 60 minutes. Treatment within 60 minutes, compared with treatment within 61 to 270 minutes, was associated with increased odds of discharge to home (adjusted odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.45), independent ambulation at discharge (adjusted odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.45), and freedom from disability (modified Rankin Scale 0–1) at discharge (adjusted odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.21–2.46), without increased hemorrhagic complications or in-hospital mortality. The pace of decline in benefit of tissue plasminogen activator from onset-to-treatment times of 20 through 270 minutes was mildly nonlinear for discharge to home, with more rapid benefit loss in the first 170 minutes than later, and linear for independent ambulation and in-hospital mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Thrombolysis started within the first 60 minutes after onset is associated with best outcomes for patients with acute ischemic stroke, and benefit declined more rapidly early after onset for the ability to be discharged home. These findings support intensive efforts to organize stroke systems of care to improve the timeliness of thrombolytic therapy in acute ischemic stroke.</p></sec>

Fractional Flow Reserve and Cardiac Events in Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We evaluated the prognosis of deferred and revascularized coronary stenoses after fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement to assess its revascularization threshold in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The IRIS-FFR registry (Interventional Cardiology Research In-coope<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n Society Fractional Flow Reserve) prospectively enrolled 5846 patients with ≥1coronary lesion with FFR measurement. Revascularization was deferred in 6468 lesions and performed in 2165 lesions after FFR assessment. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization) at a median follow-up of 1.9 years and analyzed on a per-lesion basis. A marginal Cox model accounted for correlated data in patients with multiple lesions, and a model to predict per-lesion outcomes was adjusted for confounding factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>For deferred lesions, the risk of major adverse cardiac events demonstrated a significant, inverse relationship with FFR (adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.08; <i>P</i><0.001). However, this relationship was not observed in revascularized lesions (adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.70). For lesions with FFR ≥0.76, the risk of major adverse cardiac events was not significantly different between deferred and revascularized lesions. Conversely, in lesions with FFR ≤0.75, the risk of major adverse cardiac events was significantly lower in revascularized lesions than in deferred lesions (for FFR 0.71–0.75, adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.021; for FFR ≤0.70, adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–0.84; <i>P</i>=0.012).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This large, prospective registry showed that the FFR value was linearly associated with the risk of cardiac events in deferred lesions. In addition, revascularization for coronary artery stenosis with a low FFR (≤0.75) was associated with better outcomes than the deferral, whereas for a stenosis with a high FFR (≥0.76), medical treatment would be a reasonable and safe treatment strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Regist<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Temporal Trends in Adverse Events After Everolimus-Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold Versus Everolimus-Eluting Metallic Stent Implantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bioresorbable coronary stents have been introduced into clinical practice to improve the outcomes of patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. The everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) is the most studied of these stent platforms; however, recent trials comparing BVS with everolimus-eluting metallic stents (EES) raised concerns about BVS safety. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of BVS versus EES in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, scientific sessions abstracts, and relevant Web sites for randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years investigating percutaneous coronary interventions with BVS versus EES. The primary outcomes of our analysis were definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST) and target lesion failure (TLF; device-oriented composite end point of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization [TLR]). Secondary outcomes were target vessel myocardial infarction, TLR, and cardiac death. We calculated the risk estimates for main outcomes according to a fixed-effect model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 7 trials comprising data for 5583 patients randomized to receive either a BVS (n=3261) or an EES (n=2322). Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 24–36 months). Patients treated with BVS had a higher risk of definite/probable ST compared with patients treated with EES (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 3.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.97–5.62; <i>P</i><0.00001). In particular, patients with BVS had a higher risk of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the risk of acute ST was similar. Patients treated with BVS compared with EES had a higher risk at 2 years of TLF (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.90; <i>P</i>=0.003), driven mainly by an increased risk of target vessel myocardial infarction (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.28; <i>P</i>=0.0001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%) and of TLR (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.05). Of importance, the risk of TLF and TLR for patients with BVS was higher between 1 and 2 years, whereas there was no difference in the first year. Risk of cardiac death was similar between the 2 groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our meta-analysis of randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years demonstrated a higher risk of ST and of TLF in patients treated with BVS compared with EES. Of note, BVS had a higher risk of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the risk of TLF and TLR was higher between 1 and 2 years.</p></sec>

Association of Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Venous Thromboembolism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Much controversy surrounds the association of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors with venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an individual level random-effect meta-analysis including 9 prospective studies with measured baseline cardiovascular disease risk factors and validated VTE events. Definitions were harmonized across studies. Traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors were modeled categorically and continuously using restricted cubic splines. Estimates were obtained for overall VTE, provoked VTE (ie, VTE occurring in the presence of 1 or more established VTE risk factors), and unprovoked VTE, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The studies included 244 865 participants with 4910 VTE events occurring during a mean follow-up of 4.7 to 19.7 years per study. Age, sex, and body mass index-adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s for overall VTE were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89−1.07) for hypertension, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88−1.08) for hyperlipidemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89−1.15) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08−1.32) for current smoking. After full adjustment, these estimates were numerically similar. When modeled continuously, an inverse association was observed for systolic blood pressure (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>=0.79 [95% CI: 0.68−0.92] at systolic blood pressure 160 vs 110 mm Hg) but not for diastolic blood pressure or lipid measures with VTE. An important finding from VTE subtype analyses was that cigarette smoking was associated with provoked but not unprovoked VTE. Fully adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s for the associations of current smoking with provoked and unprovoked VTE were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.22−1.52) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.90−1.29), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Except for the association between cigarette smoking and provoked VTE, which is potentially mediated through comorbid conditions such as cancer, the modifiable traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors are not associated with increased VTE risk. Higher systolic blood pressure showed an inverse association with VTE.</p></sec>

Genetic Polymorphisms and Clopidogrel Efficacy for Acute Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The association of genetic polymorphisms and clopidogrel efficacy in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) remains controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between genetic polymorphisms, especially <i>CYP2C19</i> genotype, and clopidogrel efficacy for ischemic stroke or TIA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE from their inceptions to June 24, 2016. Studies that reported clopidogrel-treated patients with stroke or TIA and with information on genetic polymorphisms were included. The end points were stroke, composite vascular events, and any bleeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 15 studies of 4762 patients with stroke or TIA treated with clopidogrel, carriers of <i>CYP2C19</i> loss-of-function alleles (*2, *3, and *8) were at increased risk of stroke in comparison with noncarriers (12.0% versus 5.8%; risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.92, 95% confidence interval, 1.57–2.35; <i>P</i><0.001). Composite vascular events were also more frequent in carriers of <i>CYP2C19</i> loss-of-function alleles than in noncarriers (13.7% versus 9.4%; risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.51, 95% confidence interval, 1.10–2.06; <i>P</i>=0.01), whereas bleeding rates were similar (2.4% versus 3.1%; risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.89, 95% confidence interval, 0.58–1.35; <i>P</i>=0.59). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity among the included studies for stroke, but there was for composite vascular events. Genetic variants other than <i>CYP2C19</i> were not associated with clinical outcomes, with the exception that significant associations of <i>PON1</i>, <i>P2Y12</i>, and <i>COX-1</i> with outcomes were observed in 1 study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Carriers of <i>CYP2C19</i> loss-of-function alleles are at greater risk of stroke and composite vascular events than noncarriers among patients with ischemic stroke or TIA treated with clopidogrel.</p></sec>

Three Arterial Grafts Improve Late Survival
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little evidence shows whether a third arterial graft provides superior outcomes compared with the use of 2 arterial grafts in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. A meta-analysis of all the propensity score-matched observational studies comparing the long-term outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting with the use of 2-arterial versus 3-arterial grafts was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science to identify relevant articles. Long-term mortality in the propensity score-matched populations was the primary end point. Secondary end points were in-hospital/30-day mortality for the propensity score-matched populations and long-term mortality for the unmatched populations. In the matched population, time-to-event outcome for long-term mortality was extracted as hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s, along with their variance. Statistical pooling of survival (time-to-event) was performed according to a random effect model, computing risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight propensity score-matched studies reporting on 10 287 matched patients (2-arterial graft: 5346; 3-arterial graft: 4941) were selected for final comparison. The mean follow-up time ranged from 37.2 to 196.8 months. The use of 3 arterial grafts was not statistically associated with early mortality (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–1.22; <i>P</i>=0.62). The use of 3 arterial grafts was associated with statistically significantly lower hazard for late death (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.87; <i>P</i><0.001), irrespective of sex and diabetic mellitus status.

Use of Intravenous Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke Who Take Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants Before Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Intravenous rt-PA (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator) is effective in improving outcomes in ischemic stroke; however, there are few data on the use of rt-PA in patients who are receiving a non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using data from the American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Registry, we examined the outcomes of use of thrombolytic therapy in patients with ischemic stroke who received anticoagulation with NOACs versus those on warfarin (international normalized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> <1.7) or not on anticoagulation from 1289 registry hospitals between October 2012 and March 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 42 887 patients with ischemic stroke treated with intravenous rt-PA within 4.5 hours, 251 were taking NOACs (dabigatran 87, rivaroxaban 129, and apixaban 35) before their stroke, 1500 were taking warfarin, and 41 136 were on neither. Patients on NOACs or warfarin were older, had more comorbid conditions, and experienced more severe strokes than did those who were not on anticoagulation (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 12, 13, and 9, respectively). Unadjusted rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the NOAC, warfarin, and none groups were 4.8%, 4.9%, and 3.9%, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.11). In comparison with those not on anticoagulation, the adjusted odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> for symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage for those on NOACs was 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.51–1.65) and for those on warfarin the adjusted odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> was 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.10). There were also no significant differences in the risk for life-threatening/serious systemic hemorrhage, any rt-PA complication, in-hospital mortality, and modified Rankin Scale at discharge across 3 groups. Similar results were also found after propensity score matching.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although experience of using rt-PA in patients with ischemic stroke on a NOAC is limited, these preliminary observations suggest that rt-PA appears to be reasonably well tolerated without prohibitive risks for adverse events among selected NOAC-treated patients. Future studies should evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous rt-PA in patients with ischemic stroke who are taking NOACs.</p></sec>

ATM directs DNA damage responses and proteostasis via genetically separable pathways
<p>The protein kinase ATM is a master regulator of the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response but also responds directly to oxidative stress. Loss of ATM causes ataxia telangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder with pleiotropic symptoms that include cerebellar dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, and premature aging. We genetically separated the activation of ATM by DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e from that by oxidative stress using separation-of-function mutations. We found that deficient activation of ATM by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and DNA double-strand breaks resulted in loss of cell viability, checkpoint activation, and DNA end resection in response to DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. In contrast, loss of oxidative activation of ATM had minimal effects on DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e–related outcomes but blocked ATM-mediated initiation of checkpoint responses after oxidative stress and resulted in deficiencies in mitochondrial function and autophagy. In addition, expression of a variant ATM incapable of activation by oxidative stress resulted in widespread protein aggregation. These results indicate a direct relationship between the mechanism of ATM activation and its effects on cellular metabolism and DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e responses in human cells and implicate ATM in the control of protein homeostasis.</p>

Estimating economic damage from climate change in the United States
<p>Estimates of climate change <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>es that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>es between 2 and 20% of county income (90% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).</p>

Function of the Plant DNA Polymerase Epsilon in Replicative Stress Sensing, a Genetic Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Faithful transmission of the genetic information is essential in all living organisms. DNA replication is therefore a critical step of cell proliferation, because of the potential occurrence of replication errors or DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e when progression of a replication fork is hampered causing replicative stress. Like other types of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, replicative stress activates the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response, a signaling cascade allowing cell cycle arrest and repair of lesions. The replicative DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) was shown to activate the S-phase checkpoint in yeast in response to replicative stress, but whether this mechanism functions in multicellular eukaryotes remains unclear. Here, we explored the genetic interaction between Pol ε and the main elements of the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that mutations affecting the polymerase domain of Pol ε trigger ATR-dependent signaling leading to SOG1 activation, WEE1-dependent cell cycle inhibition, and tolerance to replicative stress induced by hydroxyurea, but result in enhanced sensitivity to a wide range of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ing agents. Using knock-down lines, we also provide evidence for the direct role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing. Together, our results demonstrate that the role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing is conserved in plants, and provide, to our knowledge, the first genetic dissection of the downstream signaling events in a multicellular eukaryote.</p>

Recovery of otoacoustic emissions after high-level noise exposure in the American bullfrog
<p>The American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) has an amphibian papilla (AP) that senses airborne, low-frequency sound and generates distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) similar to other vertebrate species. Although ranid frogs are typically found in noisy environments, the effects of noise on the AP have not been studied. First, we determined the noise levels that diminished DPOAE at 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub> using an <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> stimulus level at 80 dB SPL and that also produced morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e of the sensory epithelium. Second, we compared DPOAE (2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub>) responses with histopathologic changes occurring in bullfrogs after noise exposure. Consistent morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, such as fragmented hair cells and missing bundles, as well as elimination of DPOAE responses were seen only after very high-level (>150 dB SPL) sound exposures. The morphological response of hair cells to noise differed along the mediolateral AP axis: medial hair cells were sensitive to noise and lateral hair cells were relatively insensitive to noise. Renewed or repaired hair cells were not observed until 9 days post-exposure. Following noise exposure, DPOAE responses disappeared within 24 h and then recovered to normal pre-exposure levels within 3–4 days. Our results suggest that DPOAEs in the bullfrog are sensitive to the initial period of hair cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. After noise-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, the bullfrog AP has functional recovery mechanisms that do not depend on substantial hair cell regeneration or repair. Thus, the bullfrog auditory system might serve as an interesting model for investigation of ways to prevent noise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e.</p>

These markers were separately measured in the same operators but this time wearing leg lead shielding in addition to upper body protection and compared with those operating with unprotected legs.

There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM expression after open repair. Leg protection abrogated γ-H2AX and pATM response after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair.

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of elevated ozone (1.4× ambient) and temperature (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. Temperature treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. Elevated temperature caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by elevated temperature and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. Elevated temperature increased cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e in early winter and visible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e in spring, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air temperature elevation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone elevation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but temperatures are low can increase the risk of severe seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Modeling chemotherapy-induced stress to identify rational combination therapies in the DNA damage response pathway
<p>Cells respond to DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e by activating complex signaling networks that decide cell fate, promoting not only DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e repair and survival but also cell death.

The computational model was trained and calibrated on extensive data from U2OS osteosarcoma cells, including the cell cycle distribution of the initial cell population, signaling data measured by Western blotting, and cell fate data in response to chemotherapy treatment measured by time-lapse microscopy. The resulting mechanistic model predicted the cellular responses to chemotherapy alone and in combination with targeted inhibitors of the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response pathway, which we confirmed experimentally. Computational models such as the one presented here can be used to understand the molecular basis that defines the complex interplay between cell survival and cell death and to rationally identify chemotherapy-potentiating drug combinations.</p>

Mitochondrial redox sensing by the kinase ATM maintains cellular antioxidant capacity
<p>Mitochondria are integral to cellular energy metabolism and ATP production and are involved in regulating many cellular processes. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which not only can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e cellular components but also participate in signal transduction. The kinase ATM, which is mutated in the neurodegenerative, autosomal recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), is a key player in the nuclear DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e response. However, ATM also performs a redox-sensing function mediated through formation of ROS-dependent disulfide-linked dimers. We found that mitochondria-derived hydrogen peroxide promoted ATM dimerization. In HeLa cells, ATM dimers were localized to the nucleus and inhibited by the redox regulatory protein thioredoxin 1 (TRX1), suggesting the existence of a ROS-mediated, stress-signaling relay from mitochondria to the nucleus. ATM dimer formation did not affect its association with chromatin in the absence or presence of nuclear DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, consistent with the separation of its redox and DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e signaling functions. Comparative analysis of U2OS cells expressing either wild-type ATM or the redox sensing–deficient C2991L mutant revealed that one function of ATM redox sensing is to promote glucose flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by increasing the abundance and activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), thereby increasing cellular antioxidant capacity. The PPP produces the coenzyme NADPH needed for a robust antioxidant response, including the regeneration of TRX1, indicating the existence of a regulatory feedback loop involving ATM and TRX1. We propose that loss of the mitochondrial ROS-sensing function of ATM may cause cellular ROS accumulation and oxidative stress in A-T.</p>

K63-linked polyubiquitin chains bind to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair
<p>Polyubiquitylation is canonically viewed as a posttranslational modification that governs protein stability or protein-protein interactions, in which distinct polyubiquitin linkages ultimately determine the fate of modified protein(s). We explored whether polyubiquitin chains have any nonprotein-related function. Using in vitro pull-down assays with synthetic materials, we found that polyubiquitin chains with the Lys<sup>63</sup> (K63) linkage bound to DNA through a motif we called the “DNA-interacting patch” (DIP), which is composed of the adjacent residues Thr<sup>9</sup>, Lys<sup>11</sup>, and Glu<sup>34</sup>. Upon DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, the binding of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to DNA enhanced the recruitment of repair factors through their interaction with an Ile<sup>44</sup> patch in ubiquitin to facilitate DNA repair. Furthermore, experimental or cancer patient–derived mutations within the DIP impaired the DNA binding capacity of ubiquitin and subsequently attenuated K63-linked polyubiquitin chain accumulation at sites of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, thereby resulting in defective DNA repair and increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ing agents. Our results therefore highlight a critical physiological role for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in binding to DNA to facilitate DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e repair.</p>

DNGR-1 in dendritic cells limits tissue damage by dampening neutrophil recruitment
<p>Host injury triggers feedback mechanisms that limit tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. Conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) express dendritic cell natural killer lectin group receptor-1 (DNGR-1), encoded by the gene <i>Clec9a</i>, which senses tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e and favors cross-presentation of dead-cell material to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Here we find that DNGR-1 additionally reduces host-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ing inflammatory responses induced by sterile and infectious tissue injury in mice. DNGR-1 deficiency leads to exacerbated caerulein-induced necrotizing pancreatitis and increased pathology during systemic <i>Candida albicans</i> infection without affecting fungal burden. This effect is B and T cell–independent and attributable to increased neutrophilia in DNGR-1–deficient settings. Mechanistically, DNGR-1 engagement activates SHP-1 and inhibits MIP-2 (encoded by <i>Cxcl2</i>) production by cDC1s during <i>Candida</i> infection. This consequently restrains neutrophil recruitment and promotes disease tolerance. Thus, DNGR-1–mediated sensing of injury by cDC1s serves as a rheostat for the control of tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, innate immunity, and immunopathology.</p>

Key-and-lock commodity self-healing copolymers
<p>Self-healing materials are notable for their ability to recover from physical or chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. We report that commodity copolymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate)/n-butyl acrylate [p(MMA/nBA)] and their derivatives, can self-heal upon mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. This behavior occurs in a narrow compositional range for copolymer topologies that are preferentially alternating with a random component (alternating/random) and is attributed to favorable interchain van der Waals forces forming key-and-lock interchain junctions. The use of van der Waals forces instead of supramolecular or covalent rebonding or encapsulated reactants eliminates chemical and physical alterations and enables multiple recovery upon mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e without external intervention. Unlike other self-healing approaches, perturbation of ubiquitous van der Waals forces upon mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e is energetically unfavorable for interdigitated alternating/random copolymer motifs that facilitate self-healing under ambient conditions.</p>

Triggered recruitment of ESCRT machinery promotes endolysosomal repair
<p>Endolysosomes can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed by diverse materials. Terminally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed compartments are degraded by lysophagy, but pathways that repair salvageable organelles are poorly understood. Here we found that the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, known to mediate budding and fission on endolysosomes, also plays an essential role in their repair. ESCRTs were rapidly recruited to acutely injured endolysosomes through a pathway requiring calcium and ESCRT-activating factors that was independent of lysophagy. We used live-cell imaging to demonstrate that ESCRTs responded to small perforations in endolysosomal membranes and enabled compartments to recover from limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. Silica crystals that disrupted endolysosomes also triggered ESCRT recruitment. ESCRTs thus provide a defense against endolysosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e likely to be relevant in physiological and pathological contexts.</p>

Hawkmoths use nectar sugar to reduce oxidative damage from flight

SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE1 Links DNA Damage Response to Organ Regeneration

In contrast to wild-type plants, <i>sog1</i> plants, which are defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e-induced programmed cell death, maintain the cell identities and stereotypical structure of the stem cell niche after irradiation, but these cells fail to undergo cell division, terminating root growth.

High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice
<p>Increased oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of reproduction. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e during reproduction. We tested whether the link between reproduction and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and antioxidative capacity. We studied the effect of reproduction on OS in females of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR females showed higher oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR females. Reproduction did not affect oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e to lipids in either line; however, it reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e to DNA in L-BMR females. Reproduction increased catalase activity in liver (significantly stronger in L-BMR females) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of reproduction on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e to lipids, proteins and DNA. Antioxidants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as antioxidants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

Inflammation, necrosis, and the kinase RIP3 are key mediators of AAG-dependent alkylation-induced retinal degeneration
<p>DNA-alkylating agents are commonly used to kill cancer cells, but the base excision repair (BER) pathway they trigger can also produce toxic intermediates that cause tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, such as retinal degeneration (RD). Apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death, is assumed to be the main mechanism of this alkylation-induced photoreceptor (PR) cell death in RD. Here, we studied the involvement of necroptosis (another programmed cell death process) and inflammation in alkylation-induced RD. Male mice exposed to a methylating agent exhibited a reduced number of PR cell rows, active gliosis, and cytokine induction and macrophage infiltration in the retina. Dying PRs exhibited a necrotic morphology, increased 8-hydroxyguanosine abundance (an oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e marker), and overexpression of the necroptosis-associated genes <i>Rip1</i> and <i>Rip3</i>. The activity of PARP1, which mediates BER, cell death, and inflammation, was increased in PR cells and associated with the release of proinflammatory chemokine HMGB1 from PR nuclei. Mice lacking the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 exhibited more severe RD, whereas deficiency of RIP3 (also known as RIPK3) conferred partial protection. Female mice were partially protected from alkylation-induced RD, showing reduced necroptosis and inflammation compared to males. PRs in mice lacking the BER-initiating DNA glycosylase AAG did not exhibit alkylation-induced necroptosis or inflammation. Our findings show that AAG-initiated BER at alkylated DNA bases induces sex-dependent RD primarily by triggering necroptosis and activating an inflammatory response that amplifies the original <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e and, furthermore, reveal new potential targets to prevent this side effect of chemotherapy.</p>

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as oscillations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance oscillated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ing chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

A target to suppress inflammation
<p>Tissues that are stressed by injury or by invading pathogens elicit signals for the recruitment of inflammatory immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, which consequently release reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) as part of the innate immune response (<i>1</i>). This flood of RONS is important for directly attacking invading pathogens and for warding off infection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed tissue. But the efficiency of RONS in inactivating invading cells and viruses creates an Achilles heel of the innate immune response, namely that RONS are also able to kill and mutate cells in healthy tissues. Although inflammatory responses are usually counterbalanced over time by an opposing anti-inflammatory response, achieving the optimal balance with minimal collateral tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e is difficult even in healthy individuals, and virtually impossible in individuals with certain disease conditions such as ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis (<i>2</i>). Therefore, the development of anti-inflammatory drugs, targeting inflammation from a variety of different angles, has flourished in recent decades. On page 834 of this issue, Visnes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) present an entirely new approach to suppressing the inflammatory response. Counter-intuitively, this approach involves the inhibition of the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) DNA repair enzyme that recognizes and initiates the base excision repair of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), one of the major types of DNA base <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e induced by RONS.</p>

A friendly danger
<p>Tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e leads to the production of danger signals that regulate inflammatory responses (<i>1</i>). These danger signals are detected by an array of cellular receptors on innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells, that enable them to respond to tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e appropriately. Dendritic cell NK lectin group receptor-1 (DNGR-1) is a C-type lectin receptor (CLR) that can sense F-actin, which becomes exposed when cells lose plasma membrane integrity (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). On page 351 of this issue, del Fresno <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) reveal that upon sensing this danger signal, DNGR-1 restricts innate inflammation during both infectious and noninfectious tissue injury, so as to limit excessive immunopathology. Their findings have implications for our understanding of how our immune system regulates responses to tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e.</p>

Nuclear Prohibitin3 Maintains Genome Integrity and Cell Proliferation in the Root Meristem through Minichromosome Maintenance 2
<p>The nucleo-mitochondrial dual-localized proteins can act as gene expression regulators; however, few instances of these proteins have been described in plants. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PROHIBITIN 3 (PHB3) is involved in stress responses and developmental processes, but it is unknown how these roles are achieved at the molecular level in the nucleus. In this study, we show that nucleo-mitochondrial PHB3 plays an essential role in regulating genome stability and cell proliferation. <i>PHB3</i> is up-regulated by DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e agents, and the stress-induced PHB3 proteins accumulate in the nucleus. Loss of function of <i>PHB3</i> results in DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e and defective maintenance of the root stem cell niche. Subsequently, the expression patterns and levels of the root stem cell regulators are altered and down-regulated, respectively. In addition, the <i>phb3</i> mutant shows aberrant cell division and altered expression of cell cycle–related genes, such as <i>CycB1</i> and <i>Cyclin dependent kinase 1</i>. Moreover, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) genes, e.g. <i>MCM2</i>, <i>MCM3</i>, <i>MCM4</i>, <i>MCM5</i>, <i>MCM6</i>, and <i>MCM7</i>, are up-regulated in the <i>phb3</i> mutant. Reducing the <i>MCM2</i> expression level substantially recovers the DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e in the <i>phb3</i> mutant and partially rescues the altered cell proliferation and root deficiency of <i>phb3</i> seedlings. PHB3 acts as a transcriptional coregulator that represses <i>MCM2</i> expression by competitively binding to the promoter E2F–cis-acting elements with E2Fa so as to modulate primary root growth. Collectively, these findings indicate that nuclear-localized PHB3 acts as a transcriptional coregulator that suppresses <i>MCM2</i> expression to sustain genome integrity and cell proliferation for stem cell niche maintenance in Arabidopsis.</p>

Selective Elimination of Membrane-Damaged Chloroplasts via Microautophagy
<p>Plant chloroplasts constantly accumulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e caused by visible wavelengths of light during photosynthesis. Our previous study revealed that entire photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed chloroplasts are subjected to vacuolar digestion through an autophagy process termed chlorophagy; however, how this process is induced and executed remained poorly understood. In this study, we monitored intracellular induction of chlorophagy in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves and found that mesophyll cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed by high visible light displayed abnormal chloroplasts with a swollen shape and 2.5 times the volume of normal chloroplasts. In wild-type plants, the activation of chlorophagy decreased the number of swollen chloroplasts. In the autophagy-deficient <i>autophagy</i> mutants, the swollen chloroplasts persisted, and dysfunctional chloroplasts that had lost chlorophyll fluorescence accumulated in the cytoplasm. Chloroplast swelling and subsequent induction of chlorophagy were suppressed by the application of exogenous mannitol to increase the osmotic pressure outside chloroplasts or by overexpression of VESICLE INDUCING PROTEIN IN PLASTID1, which maintains chloroplast envelope integrity. Microscopic observations of autophagy-related membranes showed that swollen chloroplasts were partly surrounded by autophagosomal structures and were engulfed directly by the tonoplast, as in microautophagy. Our results indicate that an elevation in osmotic potential inside the chloroplast due to high visible light-derived envelope <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e results in chloroplast swelling and serves as an induction factor for chlorophagy, and this process mobilizes entire chloroplasts via tonoplast-mediated sequestering to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of dysfunctional chloroplasts.</p>

The Transcriptional Coactivator ADA2b Recruits a Structural Maintenance Protein to Double-Strand Breaks during DNA Repair in Plants
<p>DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e occurs in all cells and can hinder chromosome stability and cell viability. Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes5/6 (SMC5/6) is a protein complex that functions as an evolutionarily conserved chromosomal ATPase critical for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, the mechanisms regulating this complex in plants are poorly understood. Here, we identified the transcriptional coactivator ALTERATION/DEFICIENCY IN ACTIVATION2B (ADA2b) as an interactor of SMC5 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). ADA2b is a conserved component of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase complex, which functions in transcriptional regulation. Characterization of mutant and knockdown Arabidopsis lines showed that disruption of either <i>SMC5</i> or <i>ADA2b</i> resulted in enhanced DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. Both SMC5 and ADA2b were associated with γ-H2AX, a marker of DSBs, and the recruitment of SMC5 onto DSBs was dependent on ADA2b. In addition, overexpression of <i>SMC5</i> in the <i>ada2b</i> mutant background stimulated cell death. Collectively, our results show that the interaction between ADA2b and SMC5 mediates DNA repair in plant cells, suggesting a functional association between these conserved proteins and further elucidating mechanisms of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e repair in plants.</p>

Mitochondria Affect Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Photosensitivity in a Green Alga
<p>Photosynthetic organisms use sunlight as the primary source of energy to support their metabolism. In eukaryotes, reactions responsible of the conversion of light into chemical energy occur in specific organelles, the chloroplasts. In this study, we showed that mitochondria also have a seminal influence on cells’ energy metabolism and on photosynthetic reactions. This is illustrated by the observation that the strong photosensitivity of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> cells depleted of the chloroplast protein PGRL1 was rescued by the introduction of a mitochondrial mutation affecting respiratory complex I. Functional analysis showed that such a reduced respiratory activity influenced chloroplast electron transport with consequent overreduction of plastoquinone and donor-side limitation of photosystem I (PSI). As a consequence, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e due to excess light affected more photosystem II (PSII) rather than PSI. Double mutant cells are able to grow under excess illumination, while single <i>pgrl1</i> are not, thanks to the presence of an efficient repair mechanism of PSII. These results also underline the seminal biological relevance of the regulation of electron transport reactions within the photosynthetic complexes. Photosynthetic organisms evolved a strategy to respond to excess light where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e is targeting preferentially to a specific complex, PSII. Cells are able to endure extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e targeting this complex thanks to an efficient repair mechanisms, while if PSI is affected, there are drastic consequences on growth.</p>

YAP-mediated mechanotransduction determines the podocyte’s response to damage
<p>Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells of the kidney filtration barrier. They are subjected to physiological filtration pressure and considerable mechanical strain, which can be further increased in various kidney diseases. When injury causes cytoskeletal reorganization and morphological alterations of these cells, the filtration barrier may become compromised and allow proteins to leak into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Using time-resolved proteomics, we showed that podocyte injury stimulated the activity of the transcriptional coactivator YAP and the expression of YAP target genes in a rat model of glomerular disease before the development of proteinuria. Although the activities of YAP and its ortholog TAZ are activated by mechanical stress in most cell types, injury reduced YAP and TAZ activity in cultured human and mouse podocyte cell lines grown on stiff substrates. Culturing these cells on soft matrix or inhibiting stress fiber formation recapitulated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e-induced YAP up-regulation observed in vivo, indicating a mechanotransduction-dependent mechanism of YAP activation in podocytes. YAP overexpression in cultured podocytes increased the abundance of extracellular matrix–related proteins that can contribute to fibrosis. YAP activity was increased in mouse models of diabetic nephropathy, and the YAP target <i>CTGF</i> was highly expressed in renal biopsies from glomerular disease patients. Although overexpression of human YAP in mice induced mild proteinuria, pharmacological inhibition of the interaction between YAP and its partner TEAD in rats ameliorated glomerular disease and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e-induced mechanosignaling in the glomeruli. Thus, perturbation of YAP-dependent mechanosignaling is a potential therapeutic target for treating some glomerular diseases.</p>

Severing enzymes amplify microtubule arrays through lattice GTP-tubulin incorporation
<p>Spastin and katanin sever and destabilize microtubules. Paradoxically, despite their destructive activity they increase microtubule mass in vivo. We combined single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy to show that the elemental step in microtubule severing is the generation of nanoscale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e throughout the microtubule by active extraction of tubulin heterodimers. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e sites are repaired spontaneously by guanosine triphosphate (GTP)–tubulin incorporation, which rejuvenates and stabilizes the microtubule shaft. Consequently, spastin and katanin increase microtubule rescue rates. Furthermore, newly severed ends emerge with a high density of GTP-tubulin that protects them against depolymerization. The stabilization of the newly severed plus ends and the higher rescue frequency synergize to amplify microtubule number and mass. Thus, severing enzymes regulate microtubule architecture and dynamics by promoting GTP-tubulin incorporation within the microtubule shaft.</p>

Edonerpic bound to collapsin-response-mediator-protein 2 (CRMP2) and failed to augment recovery in CRMP2-deficient mice.

A mitosis-specific and R loop–driven ATR pathway promotes faithful chromosome segregation
<p>The ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase is crucial for DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e and replication stress responses. Here, we describe an unexpected role of ATR in mitosis. Acute inhibition or degradation of ATR in mitosis induces whole-chromosome missegregation. The effect of ATR ablation is not due to altered cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity, DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e responses, or unscheduled DNA synthesis but to loss of an ATR function at centromeres. In mitosis, ATR localizes to centromeres through Aurora A–regulated association with centromere protein F (CENP-F), allowing ATR to engage replication protein A (RPA)–coated centromeric R loops. As ATR is activated at centromeres, it stimulates Aurora B through Chk1, preventing formation of lagging chromosomes. Thus, a mitosis-specific and R loop–driven ATR pathway acts at centromeres to promote faithful chromosome segregation, revealing functions of R loops and ATR in suppressing chromosome instability.</p>

DJ-1–depleted cells displayed increased levels of glycated DNA, DNA strand breaks, and phosphorylated p53. Deglycase-deficient bacterial mutants displayed increased levels of glycated DNA and RNA and exhibited strong mutator phenotypes.

Inflammation by way of macrophage metabolism
<p>Although inflammation is an essential component of immunity, an excessive response can lead to tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e and autoimmune pathologies. In most cases, this is avoided with parallel, integrated regulatory responses that allow healing to commence. A central mediator of this regulatory response is the cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). IL-10 is particularly important in mucosal tissues, such as the intestine, where it limits macrophage proinflammatory functions. On page 513 of this issue, Ip <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report that IL-10 alters macrophage function by promoting the clearance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed mitochondria and modulating cellular metabolism to limit inflammation.</p>

The DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome controls radiation-induced cell death and tissue injury
<p>Acute exposure to ionizing radiation induces massive cell death and severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e to tissues containing actively proliferating cells, including bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology remain controversial. Here, we show that mice deficient in the double-stranded DNA sensor AIM2 are protected from both subtotal body irradiation–induced gastrointestinal syndrome and total body irradiation–induced hematopoietic failure. AIM2 mediates the caspase-1–dependent death of intestinal epithelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to double-strand DNA breaks caused by ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents. Mechanistically, we found that AIM2 senses radiation-induced DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e in the nucleus to mediate inflammasome activation and cell death. Our results suggest that AIM2 may be a new therapeutic target for ionizing radiation exposure.</p>

PINK1-Phosphorylated Mitofusin 2 Is a Parkin Receptor for Culling Damaged Mitochondria
<sec><title>Where Parkin Parks</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed mitochondria are removed from cells in a process known as mitophagy. Failure of this quality-control mechanism contributes to Parkinson's disease. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed mitochondria lose membrane depolarization, the protein kinase, PINK1, accumulates on the mitochondrial surface, recruits Parkin, and promotes mitophagy. <bold>Chen and Dorn</bold> (p. 471) describe another component of this process, mitofusin 2, which appears to function as the receptor for Parkin on the surface of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>ed mitochondria.</p></sec>

The Linker Histone GH1-HMGA1 Is Involved in Telomere Stability and DNA Damage Repair
<p>Despite intensive searches, few proteins involved in telomere homeostasis have been identified in plants. Here, we used pull-down assays to identify potential telomeric interactors in the model plant species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We identified the candidate protein GH1-HMGA1 (also known as HON4), an uncharacterized linker histone protein of the High Mobility Group Protein A (HMGA) family in plants. HMGAs are architectural transcription factors and have been suggested to function in DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e repair, but their precise biological roles remain unclear. Here, we show that GH1-HMGA1 is required for efficient DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e repair and telomere integrity in Arabidopsis. GH1-HMGA1 mutants exhibit developmental and growth defects, accompanied by ploidy defects, increased telomere dysfunction-induced foci, mitotic anaphase bridges, and degraded telomeres. Furthermore, mutants have a higher sensitivity to genotoxic agents such as mitomycin C and γ-irradiation. Our work also suggests that GH1-HMGA1 is involved directly in the repair process by allowing the completion of homologous recombination.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During oxygenic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to oxygen, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

The Liverwort, <i>Marchantia</i>, Drives Alternative Electron Flow Using a Flavodiiron Protein to Protect PSI
<p>The diffusion efficiency of oxygen in the atmosphere, like that of CO<sub>2</sub>, is approximately 10<sup>4</sup> times greater than that in aqueous environments. Consequently, terrestrial photosynthetic organisms need mechanisms to protect against potential oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e. The liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, a basal land plant, has habitats where it is exposed to both water and the atmosphere. Furthermore, like cyanobacteria, <i>M. polymorpha</i> has genes encoding flavodiiron proteins (FLV). In cyanobacteria, FLVs mediate oxygen-dependent alternative electron flow (AEF) to suppress the production of reactive oxygen species. Here, we investigated whether FLVs are required for the protection of photosynthesis in <i>M. polymorpha</i>. A mutant deficient in the FLV1 isozyme (Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>) sustained photooxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e to photosystem I (PSI) following repetitive short-saturation pulses of light. Compared with the wild type (Takaragaike-1), Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> showed the same photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate but a lower electron transport rate during the induction phase of photosynthesis. Additionally, the reaction center chlorophyll in PSI, P700, was highly reduced in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i> but not in Takaragaike-1. These results indicate that the gene product of <i>MpFlv1</i> drives AEF to oxidize PSI, as in cyanobacteria. Furthermore, FLV-mediated AEF supports the production of a proton motive force to possibly induce the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and suppress electron transport in the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub>/<i>f</i> complex. After submerging the thalli, a decrease in photosystem II operating efficiency was observed, particularly in Δ<i>MpFlv1</i>, which implies that species living in these sorts of habitats require FLV-mediated AEF.</p>

Capping Protein Modulates Actin Remodeling in Response to Reactive Oxygen Species during Plant Innate Immunity
<p>Plants perceive microbe-associated molecular patterns and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e-associated molecular patterns to activate innate immune signaling events, such as bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The actin cytoskeleton remodels during the first 5 min of innate immune signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) epidermal cells; however, the immune signals that impinge on actin cytoskeleton and its response regulators remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that rapid actin remodeling upon elicitation with diverse microbe-associated molecular patterns and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e-associated molecular patterns represent a conserved plant immune response. Actin remodeling requires ROS generated by the defense-associated NADPH oxidase, RBOHD. Moreover, perception of flg22 by its cognate receptor complex triggers actin remodeling through the activation of RBOHD-dependent ROS production. Our genetic studies reveal that the ubiquitous heterodimeric capping protein transduces ROS signaling to the actin cytoskeleton during innate immunity. Additionally, we uncover a negative feedback loop between actin remodeling and flg22-induced ROS production.</p>

The effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
<p>The effects of flight behavior on physiology and senescence may be profound in insects because of the extremely high metabolic costs of flight. Flight capacity in insects decreases with age; in contrast, limiting flight behavior extends lifespan and slows the age-related loss of antioxidant capacity and accumulation of oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e in flight muscles. In this study, we tested the effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity by measuring wingbeat frequency, the ability to fly in a hypo-dense gas mixture, and metabolic rate in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Specifically, 5-day-old adult flies were separated into three life-long treatments: (1) those not allowed to fly (no flight), (2) those allowed – but not forced – to fly (voluntary flight) and (3) those mechanically stimulated to fly (induced flight). Flight capacity senesced earliest in flies from the no-flight treatment, followed by the induced-flight group and then the voluntary flight group. Wingbeat frequency senesced with age in all treatment groups, but was most apparent in the voluntary- and induced-flight groups. Metabolic rate during agitated flight senesced earliest and most rapidly in the induced flight group, and was low and uniform throughout age in the no-flight group. Early senescence in the induced-flight group was likely due to the acceleration of deleterious aging phenomena such as the rapid accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damag</span></strong>e at the cellular level, while the early loss of flight capacity and low metabolic rates in the no-flight group demonstrate that disuse effects can also significantly alter senescence patterns of whole-insect performance.</p>

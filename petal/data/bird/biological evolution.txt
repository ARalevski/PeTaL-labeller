The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in cancer genomes, providing new insights into how and in what ways cancer can develop and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic errors in cancer cells that reveal basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes gone awry that are required for cancer initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic changes that are present in their tumors (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that cancer genomes harbor many additional “passenger” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (<i>4</i>). Patterns of driver and passenger DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions derived from cancer genomes have provided clues about the different ways that cancer can manifest as a disease of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental carcinogens (for example, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion patterns caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional patterns can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a tumor to develop (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in normal tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions arise in normal tissues but do not necessarily lead to cancer.</p>

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic basis. Heterozygous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the gene encoding the bone morpho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of diagnosis were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>BMPR2</i> were identified in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at diagnosis (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be identified reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at diagnosis suggests the underlying molecular diagnosis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic testing can identify these misclassified patients, allowing appropriate management and early referral for lung transplantation.</p></sec>

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in cancer genomics is identifying “driver” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions from the many neutral “passenger” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions within a given tumor. To identify driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that would otherwise be lost within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 tumor-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were identified on the basis of amino acid conservation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-cancer analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, despite its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional frequency falling within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional noise for this cancer type. The majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric cancer cells harboring LOF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric cancer. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional cancer driver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and define the JNK pathway as tumor-suppressive in gastric cancer.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y, disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics, and conservation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. To estimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates and evaluate the effect of selection on new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, we propagated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. We observed a surprisingly high level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are central to evolution, providing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variation upon which selection acts. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion’s effect on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variation, complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic disease, the accumulation of deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional tolerance, and evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional effects on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

Novel Desmin Mutation p.Glu401Asp Impairs Filament Formation, Disrupts Cell Membrane Integrity, and Causes Severe Arrhythmogenic Left Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Desmin (<i>DES</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions cause severe skeletal and cardiac muscle disease with heterogeneous phenotypes.

Genetic Risk Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation

We examined associations between AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk scores and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents. Scores were based on 11 to 719 common variants (≥5%) associated with AF at <i>P</i> values ranging from <1×10<sup>−3</sup> to <1×10<sup>−8</sup> in a prior independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic association study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Incident AF occurred in 1032 individuals (5.5%).

Common Genetic Variant Risk Score Is Associated With Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Risk

Mutation dynamics and fitness effects followed in single cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions have been investigated for more than a century but remain difficult to observe directly in single cells, which limits the characterization of their dynamics and fitness effects. By combining microfluidics, time-lapse imaging, and a fluorescent tag of the mismatch repair system in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, we visualized the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in single cells, revealing Poissonian dynamics. Concomitantly, we tracked the growth and life span of single cells, accumulating ~20,000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions genome-wide over hundreds of generations. This analysis revealed that 1% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were lethal; nonlethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions displayed a heavy-tailed distribution of fitness effects and were dominated by quasi-neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions with an average cost of 0.3%. Our approach has enabled the investigation of single-cell individuality in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion fitness costs, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion interactions.</p>

Identification of a New Host Factor Required for Antiviral RNAi and Amplification of Viral siRNAs
<p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are processed from virus-specific dsRNA to direct antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) in diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic hosts. We have recently performed a sensitized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and identified two related phospholipid flippases required for antiviral RNAi and the amplification of virus-derived siRNAs by plant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase1 (RDR1) and RDR6. Here we report the identification and cloning of <i>ANTIVIRAL RNAI</i>-<i>DEFECTIVE2</i> (<i>AVI2</i>) from the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic screen. <i>AVI2</i> encodes a multispan transmembrane protein broadly conserved in plants and animals with two homologous human proteins known as magnesium transporters. We show that <i>avi2</i> mutant plants display no developmental defects and develop severe disease symptoms after infection with a mutant <i>Cucumber mosaic virus</i> (CMV) defective in RNAi suppression. <i>AVI2</i> is induced by CMV infection, particularly in veins, and is required for antiviral RNAi and RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s of viral siRNAs. AVI2 is also necessary for Dicer-like2-mediated amplification of 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs induced in <i>dcl4</i> mutant plants by infection, but dispensable for RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s of endogenous transacting siRNAs. Further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic studies illustrate that AVI2 plays a partially redundant role with AVI2H, the most closely related member in the <i>AVI2</i> gene family, in RDR1-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s of viral siRNAs and the endogenous virus-activated siRNAs (vasi-RNAs). Interestingly, we discovered a specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interaction of AVI2 with AVI1 flippase that is critical for plant development. We propose that AVI1 and AVI2 participate in the virus-induced formation of the RDR1/RDR6-specific, membrane-bound RNA synthesis compartment, essential for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s of highly abundant viral siRNAs and vasi-RNAs.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutagen</span></strong>ized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutagen</span></strong>esis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) as a model system, we discovered that a transgene exogenously expressing histone 3 Lys-36 to Met <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion (K36M) acts in a dominant-negative manner to cause global reduction of H3K36 methylation. Remarkably, this dominant repressive activity is dosage-dependent and causes strong developmental perturbations including extreme branching and early flowering by affecting the expression of genes involved in developmental and metabolic processes. Besides the established pathological roles of K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in tumor cells, we demonstrate a physiological outcome for K-to-M induced H3K36 hypomethylation. This study provides evidence for a conserved dominant-negative inhibitory role of histone K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion across the plant and animal kingdoms. We also highlight the unique ability of K36M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions to alter plant developmental processes leading to severe pleiotropic phenotypes. Finally, our data suggests K-to-M <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions may provide a useful strategy for altering epi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic landscapes in organisms where histone methyltransferases are uncharacterized.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutagen</span></strong>ic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates suggests an approximate constancy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate in insects.</p>

Genome-Wide Biases in the Rate and Molecular Spectrum of Spontaneous Mutations in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>
<p>The vast diversity in nucleotide composition and architecture among bacterial genomes may be partly explained by inherent biases in the rates and spectra of spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions. Bacterial genomes with multiple chromosomes are relatively unusual but some are relevant to human health, none more so than the causative agent of cholera, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Here, we present the genome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion spectra in wild-type and mismatch repair (MMR) defective backgrounds of two <i>Vibrio</i> species, the low-%GC squid symbiont <i>V. fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>V. cholerae</i>, collected under conditions that greatly minimize the efficiency of natural selection. In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have among the lowest rates for base-substitution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (bpsms) and insertion–deletion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions (indels) that have been measured, below 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup>/genome/generation. <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion spectra, but both are AT-biased and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion spectra of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion patterns. Bpsm and indel rates varied among genome regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary rates of genes on chromosome 2, which likely result from weaker purifying selection. More generally, the very low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates of <i>Vibrio</i> species correlate inversely with their immense population sizes and suggest that selection may not only have maximized replication fidelity but also optimized other polygenic traits relative to the constraints of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic drift.</p>

Genetics, Lifestyle, and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in Young and Apparently Healthy Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerosis starts in childhood but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a causal risk factor, is mostly studied and dealt with when clinical events have occurred. Women are usually affected later in life than men and are underdiagnosed, undertreated, and understudied in cardiovascular trials and research. This study aims at a better understanding of lifestyle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic factors that affect LDL-C in young women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We randomly selected for every year of age 8 women with LDL-C ≤1st percentile (≤50 mg/dL) and 8 women with LDL-C ≥99th percentile (≥186 mg/dL) from 28 000 female participants aged between 25 to 40 years of a population-based cohort study. The resulting groups include 119 and 121 women, respectively, of an average 33 years of age.

Gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 induce hydrocephalus in a catalytically dependent manner
<p>Catalytically activating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>Ptpn11</i>, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause 50% of Noonan syndrome (NS) cases, whereas inactivating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>Ptpn11</i> are responsible for nearly all cases of the similar, but distinct, developmental disorder Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML; formerly called LEOPARD syndrome). However, both types of disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are gain-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions because they cause SHP2 to constitutively adopt an open conformation. We found that the catalytic activity of SHP2 was required for the pathogenic effects of gain-of-function, disease-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions on the development of hydrocephalus in the mouse. Targeted pan-neuronal knockin of a <i>Ptpn11</i> allele encoding the active SHP2 E76K mutant resulted in hydrocephalus due to aberrant development of ependymal cells and their cilia. These pathogenic effects of the E76K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion were suppressed by the additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion C459S, which abolished the catalytic activity of SHP2. Moreover, ependymal cells in NSML mice bearing the inactive SHP2 mutant Y279C were also unaffected. Mechanistically, the SHP2 E76K mutant induced developmental defects in ependymal cells by enhancing dephosphorylation and inhibition of the transcription activator STAT3. Whereas STAT3 activity was reduced in <i>Ptpn11</i><sup><i>E76K/+</i></sup> cells, the activities of the kinases ERK and AKT were enhanced, and neural cell–specific <i>Stat3</i> knockout mice also manifested developmental defects in ependymal cells and cilia. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic and biochemical data demonstrate a catalytic-dependent role of SHP2 gain-of-function disease mutants in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus.</p>

Tissue-specificity in cancer: The rule, not the exception
<p>We are in the midst of a renaissance in cancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics. Over the past several decades, candidate-based targeted sequencing efforts provided a steady stream of information on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic drivers for certain cancer types. However, with recent technological advances in DNA sequencing, this stream has become a torrent of unbiased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic information revealing the frequencies and patterns of point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions and copy number variations (CNVs) across the entire spectrum of cancers. One of the most important observations from this work is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic alterations in bona fide cancer drivers (those genes that, when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ed, promote tumorigenesis) show a remarkable spectrum of tissue specificity: Alterations in certain driver genes appear only in cancers derived from one or a few tissue types (<i>1</i>). Only a handful of cancer drivers [such as telomerase reverse transcriptase (<i>TERT</i>), <i>TP53</i>, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (<i>CDKN2A</i>) locus, and <i>MYC</i>] show broad tissue spectrums. Here, we discuss the concept of tissue specificity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic alterations in cancer and provide general hypotheses to help explain this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical phenomenon.</p>

Exploring genetic suppression interactions on a global scale
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic suppression occurs when the phenotypic defects caused by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in a particular gene are rescued by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in a second gene. To explore the principles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic suppression, we examined both literature-curated and unbiased experimental data, involving systematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mapping and whole-genome sequencing, to generate a large-scale suppression network among yeast genes. Most suppression pairs identified novel relationships among functionally related genes, providing new insights into the functional wiring diagram of the cell. In addition to suppressor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, we identified frequent secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions,in a subset of genes, that likely cause a delay in the onset of stationary phase, which appears to promote their enrichment within a propagating population. These findings allow us to formulate and quantify general mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic suppression.</p>

One brain, many genomes
<p>We each begin life as a single cell harboring a single genome, which—over the course of development—gives rise to the trillions of cells that make up the body. From skin cells to heart cells to neurons of the brain, each bears a copy of the original cell's genome. But as anyone who has used a copy machine or played the childhood game of “telephone” knows, copies are never perfect. Every cell in an individual actually has a unique genome, an imperfect copy of its cellular ancestor differentiated by inevitable somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions arising from errors in DNA replication and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutagen</span></strong>ic forces (<i>1</i>). Somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion is the fundamental process leading to all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic diseases, including cancer; every inherited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic disease also has its origins in such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion events that occurred in an ancestor's germline cells. Yet how many and what kinds of somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions accumulate in our cells as we develop and age has long been unknown and a blind spot in our understanding of the origins of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic disease.</p>

Scanning for New BRI1 Mutations via TILLING Analysis
<p>The identification and characterization of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional spectrum for a specific protein can help to elucidate its detailed cellular functions. BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), a multidomain transmembrane receptor-like kinase, is a major receptor of brassinosteroids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Within the last two decades, over 20 different <i>bri1</i> mutant alleles have been identified, which helped to determine the significance of each domain within BRI1. To further understand the molecular mechanisms of BRI1, we tried to identify additional alleles via targeted induced local lesions in genomes. Here, we report our identification of 83 new point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>BRI1</i>, including nine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that exhibit an allelic series of typical <i>bri1</i> phenotypes, from subtle to severe morphological alterations. We carried out biochemical analyses to investigate possible mechanisms of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in affecting brassinosteroid signaling. A number of interesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions have been isolated via this study. For example, <i>bri1-702</i>, the only weak allele identified so far with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in the activation loop, showed reduced autophosphorylation activity. <i>bri1-705</i>, a subtle allele with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in the extracellular portion, disrupts the interaction of BRI1 with its ligand brassinolide and coreceptor BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1. <i>bri1-706</i>, with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion in the extracellular portion, is a subtle defective mutant. Surprisingly, root inhibition analysis indicated that it is largely insensitive to exogenous brassinolide treatment. In this study, we found that <i>bri1-301</i> possesses kinase activity in vivo, clarifying a previous report arguing that kinase activity may not be necessary for the function of BRI1. These data provide additional insights into our understanding of the early events in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to observe an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions including common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions confer resistance providing a large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional target—we estimate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be estimated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> estimated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously underestimated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may underestimate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously estimated.</p>

Mutated clones are the new normal

How harmful they are depends on which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ed genes they contain. On page 970 of this issue, Yizhak <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) add to the evidence that normal tissues are not so normal after all. Examining a substantial number of healthy tissues from almost 500 individuals, they found a large number of acquired (somatic) DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions—some of which are typically associated with cancer—and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional clones of macroscopic size, in the absence of cancer pathology.

Somatic mutant clones colonize the human esophagus with age

We found strong positive selection of clones carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in 14 cancer genes, with tens to hundreds of clones per square centimeter.

Human mutation rate a legacy from our past
<p>Humans should be more like paramecia. That's because their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate is orders of magnitude lower than a human's. Those rates increase when genes involved in copying or repairing DNA stop working correctly. Although some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are good for generating variety that allows organisms to adapt to changing environments, too many can cause disease and birth defects. At a meeting in Tempe, Arizona, researchers documented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates in dozens of species and found that the species's specific rate is inversely related to the so-called "effective population" size. Small populations are less able to get rid of or compensate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic changes that increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate. In the past, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates were thought to be so stable that they were "molecular clocks" useful for dating species' divergences. But researchers are now recognizing that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rates vary from species to species.</p>

<i>NLR</i> Mutations Suppressing Immune Hybrid Incompatibility and Their Effects on Disease Resistance
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic divergence between populations can lead to reproductive isolation. Hybrid incompatibilities (HI) represent intermediate points along a continuum toward speciation. In plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variation in disease resistance (<i>R</i>) genes underlies several cases of HI. The progeny of a cross between Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>, Poland) and Kashmir2 (Kas2, central Asia) exhibits immune-related HI. This incompatibility is due to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interaction between a cluster of eight <i>TNL (TOLL/INTERLEUKIN1 RECEPTOR-NUCLEOTIDE BINDING-LEU RICH REPEAT</i>) <i>RPP1</i> (<i>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA1)</i>-<i>like</i> genes (<i>R1</i>–<i>R8</i>) from L<i>er</i> and central Asian alleles of a <i>Strubbelig</i>-family receptor-like kinase (<i>SRF3</i>) from Kas2. In characterizing mutants altered in L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI, we mapped multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions to the <i>RPP1</i>-like L<i>er</i> locus. Analysis of these <i>suppressor of Ler/Kas2 incompatibility</i> (<i>sulki</i>) mutants reveals complex, additive and epistatic interactions underlying <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus activity. The effects of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions were measured on basal defense, global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion, primary metabolism, and disease resistance to a local <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i> isolate (<i>Hpa</i> Gw) collected from Gorzéáéáów (Gw), where the Landsberg accession originated. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion sectors and metabolic hallmarks identified for HI are both dependent and independent of <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> members. We establish that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions suppressing immune-related L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI do not compromise resistance to <i>Hpa</i> Gw. QTL mapping analysis of <i>Hpa</i> Gw resistance point to <i>RPP7</i> as the causal locus. This work provides insight into the complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic architecture of the <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus and immune-related HI in Arabidopsis and into the contributions of <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> genes to HI and defense.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) genes on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these gene families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> genes moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in the <i>TCP4</i> gene conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> genes, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> genes cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream gene transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Small molecules are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in screens designed with a basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ics approach.</p>

Genetic Predisposition to High Blood Pressure and Lifestyle Factors
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of mortality worldwide.

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome

Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 proteins might identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic determinants of risk-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score–associated proteins using linear mixed-effects models in 2 population-based cohorts.

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative risk reduction with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative risk reduction among a subgroup at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic risk score derived from up to 57 common DNA sequence variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk (top quintile of polygenic risk score) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic risk score and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk, statin therapy was associated with a relative risk reduction of 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22–60; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas in all others, the relative risk reduction was 24% (95% CI, 8–37; <i>P</i>=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary prevention, relative risk reduction in those at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic risk was 46% versus 26% in all others (<i>P</i> for heterogeneity=0.05).

A calcium-sensing receptor mutation causing hypocalcemia disrupts a transmembrane salt bridge to activate β-arrestin–biased signaling
<p>The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals through G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> to stimulate cytosolic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub>) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling to control extracellular calcium homeostasis. Studies of loss- and gain-of-function <i>CASR</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions, which cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1) and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1), respectively, have revealed that the CaSR signals in a biased manner. Thus, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions associated with FHH1 lead to signaling predominantly through the MAPK pathway, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions associated with ADH1 preferentially enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> responses. We report a previously unidentified ADH1-associated R680G CaSR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion, which led to the identification of a CaSR structural motif that mediates biased signaling. Expressing CaSR<sup>R680G</sup> in HEK 293 cells showed that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion increased MAPK signaling without altering Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> responses. Moreover, this gain of function in MAPK activity occurred independently of G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> and was mediated instead by a noncanonical pathway involving β-arrestin proteins. Homology modeling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutagen</span></strong>esis studies showed that the R680G CaSR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion selectively enhanced β-arrestin signaling by disrupting a salt bridge formed between Arg<sup>680</sup> and Glu<sup>767</sup>, which are located in CaSR transmembrane domain 3 and extracellular loop 2, respectively. Thus, our results demonstrate CaSR signaling through β-arrestin and the importance of the Arg<sup>680</sup>-Glu<sup>767</sup> salt bridge in mediating signaling bias.</p>

Characterizing mutagenic effects of recombination through a sequence-level genetic map
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic diversity arises from recombination and de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion (DNM). Using a combination of microarray genotype and whole-genome sequence data on parent-child pairs, we identified 4,531,535 crossover recombinations and 200,435 DNMs. The resulting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic map has a resolution of 682 base pairs. Crossovers exhibit a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutagen</span></strong>ic effect, with overrepresentation of DNMs within 1 kilobase of crossovers in males and females. In females, a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate is observed up to 40 kilobases from crossovers, particularly for complex crossovers, which increase with maternal age. We identified 35 loci associated with the recombination rate or the location of crossovers, demonstrating extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic control of meiotic recombination, and our results highlight genes linked to the formation of the synaptonemal complex as determinants of crossovers.</p>

Heterogeneity in efflux pump expression predisposes antibiotic-resistant cells to mutation
<p>Antibiotic resistance is often the result of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that block drug activity; however, bacteria also evade antibiotics by transiently expressing genes such as multidrug efflux pumps. A crucial question is whether transient resistance can promote permanent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic changes. Previous studies have established that antibiotic treatment can select tolerant cells that then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>e to achieve permanent resistance. Whether these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions result from antibiotic stress or preexist within the population is unclear. To address this question, we focused on the multidrug pump AcrAB-TolC. Using time-lapse microscopy, we found that cells with higher <i>acrAB</i> expression have lower expression of the DNA mismatch repair gene <i>mutS</i>, lower growth rates, and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion frequencies. Thus, transient antibiotic resistance from elevated <i>acrAB</i> expression can promote spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions within single cells.</p>

The chromatin of cancer
<p>Developments in modern genomics tools have led to rapid progress in our understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic basis of cancer. Recent large-scale efforts have primarily focused on two types of analysis: mapping acquired somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions by whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>), and identification of common inherited variants that increase cancer risk using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (<i>3</i>). Despite the power of these technologies, we are still far from understanding how the variants and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions found in individual tumors precisely drive the oncogenic process. A large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic variants increase risk for cancer, but most explain only a very small fraction of the risk. Furthermore, although acquired somatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions are found in almost all tumors, most do not carry complete sets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions that, according to our present mechanistic understanding, would be sufficient to cause cancer. On page 420 of this issue, Corces <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) show how a third type of genomics approach—functional genomic analyses of primary human tumors—can begin to bridge this gap in our mechanistic understanding of the tumorigenic process.</p>

Systematic analysis of complex genetic interactions
<p>To systematically explore complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interactions, we constructed ~200,000 yeast triple mutants and scored negative trigenic interactions. We selected double-mutant query genes across a broad spectrum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes, spanning a range of quantitative features of the global digenic interaction network and tested for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interaction with a third <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion. Trigenic interactions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic network. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic interactions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic interactions. We estimate that the global trigenic interaction network is ~100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interactions to affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y of inheritance, including the genotype-to-phenotype relationship.</p>

<p>Although dynamics underlie many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes, our ability to robustly and accurately profile time-varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals and regulatory programs remains limited. Here we describe a framework for storing temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical information directly in the genomes of a cell population. We developed a “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical tape recorder” in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then recorded by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable recording over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously record the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical events on a large scale.</p>

Use of CRISPR-modified human stem cell organoids to study the origin of mutational signatures in cancer
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional processes underlie cancer initiation and progression. Signatures of these processes in cancer genomes may explain cancer etiology and could hold diagnostic and prognostic value. We developed a strategy that can be used to explore the origin of cancer-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional signatures. We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair genes in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion accumulation in organoids deficient in the mismatch repair gene <i>MLH1</i> is driven by replication errors and accurately models the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion profiles observed in mismatch repair–deficient colorectal cancers. Application of this strategy to the cancer predisposition gene <i>NTHL1</i>, which encodes a base excision repair protein, revealed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ional footprint (signature 30) previously observed in a breast cancer cohort. We show that signature 30 can arise from germline <i>NTHL1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions.</p>

An Anthropocene map of genetic diversity
<p>The Anthropocene is witnessing a loss of biodiversity, with well-documented declines in the diversity of ecosystems and species. For intraspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic diversity, however, we lack even basic knowledge on its global distribution. We georeferenced 92,801 mitochondrial sequences for >4500 species of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic diversity is 27% higher in the tropics than in nontropical regions. Overall, habitats that are more affected by humans hold less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic diversity than wilder regions, although results for mammals are sensitive to choice of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic locus. Our study associates geographic coordinates with publicly available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic sequences at a massive scale, yielding an opportunity to investigate both the drivers of this component of biodiversity and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic consequences of the anthropogenic modification of nature.</p>

A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring diagram of cellular function
<p>We generated a global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interaction network for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interactions. This comprehensive network maps <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interactions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates how coherent sets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interactions connect protein complex and pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.</p>

Ribosomal RNA Biogenesis and Its Response to Chilling Stress in <i>Oryza sativa</i>
<p>Ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s is crucial for plant growth and environmental acclimation. Processing of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) is an essential step in ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s and begins with transcription of the rDNA. The resulting precursor-rRNA (pre-rRNA) transcript undergoes systematic processing, where multiple endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic cleavages remove the external and internal transcribed spacers (ETS and ITS). The processing sites and pathways for pre-rRNA processing have been deciphered in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and, to some extent, in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, mammalian cells, and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the processing sites and pathways remain largely unknown in crops, particularly in monocots such as rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), one of the most important food resources in the world. Here, we identified the rRNA precursors produced during rRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s and the critical endonucleolytic cleavage sites in the transcribed spacer regions of pre-rRNAs in rice. We further found that two pre-rRNA processing pathways, distinguished by the order of 5′ ETS removal and ITS1 cleavage, coexist in vivo. Moreover, exposing rice to chilling stress resulted in the inhibition of rRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s mainly at the pre-rRNA processing level, suggesting that these energy-intensive processes may be reduced to increase acclimation and survival at lower temperatures. Overall, our study identified the pre-rRNA processing pathway in rice and showed that ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s is quickly inhibited by low temperatures, which may shed light on the link between ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s and environmental acclimation in crop plants.</p>

Function of the Plant DNA Polymerase Epsilon in Replicative Stress Sensing, a Genetic Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Faithful transmission of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic information is essential in all living organisms. DNA replication is therefore a critical step of cell proliferation, because of the potential occurrence of replication errors or DNA damage when progression of a replication fork is hampered causing replicative stress. Like other types of DNA damage, replicative stress activates the DNA damage response, a signaling cascade allowing cell cycle arrest and repair of lesions. The replicative DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) was shown to activate the S-phase checkpoint in yeast in response to replicative stress, but whether this mechanism functions in multicellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es remains unclear. Here, we explored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic interaction between Pol ε and the main elements of the DNA damage response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ions affecting the polymerase domain of Pol ε trigger ATR-dependent signaling leading to SOG1 activation, WEE1-dependent cell cycle inhibition, and tolerance to replicative stress induced by hydroxyurea, but result in enhanced sensitivity to a wide range of DNA damaging agents. Using knock-down lines, we also provide evidence for the direct role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing. Together, our results demonstrate that the role of Pol ε in replicative stress sensing is conserved in plants, and provide, to our knowledge, the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">genet</span></strong>ic dissection of the downstream signaling events in a multicellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>e.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Silicon Transport in Eukaryotes
<p>Biosilicification (the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical structures from silica) occurs in diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic lineages, plays a major role in global biogeochemical cycles, and has significant biotechnological applications. Silicon (Si) uptake is crucial for biosilicification, yet the evolutionary history of the transporters involved remains poorly known. Recent evidence suggests that the SIT family of Si transporters, initially identified in diatoms, may be widely distributed, with an extended family of related transporters (SIT-Ls) present in some nonsilicified organisms. Here, we identify SITs and SIT-Ls in a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es, including major silicified lineages (radiolarians and chrysophytes) and also bacterial SIT-Ls. Our evidence suggests that the symmetrical 10-transmembrane-domain SIT structure has independently evolved multiple times via duplication and fusion of 5-transmembrane-domain SIT-Ls. We also identify a second gene family, similar to the active Si transporter Lsi2, that is broadly distributed amongst siliceous and nonsiliceous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es. Our analyses resolve a distinct group of Lsi2-like genes, including plant and diatom Si-responsive genes, and sequences unique to siliceous sponges and choanoflagellates. The SIT/SIT-L and Lsi2 transporter families likely contribute to biosilicification in diverse lineages, indicating an ancient role for Si transport in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es. We propose that these Si transporters may have arisen initially to prevent Si toxicity in the high Si Precambrian oceans, with subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ically induced reductions in Si concentrations of Phanerozoic seas leading to widespread losses of SIT, SIT-L, and Lsi2-like genes in diverse lineages. Thus, the origin and diversification of two independent Si transporter families both drove and were driven by ancient ocean Si levels.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Roles of Mutation, Selection, and Expression in Determining Relative Rates of Evolution in Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genomes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es rely on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) genomes, which interact within multisubunit complexes such as oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes. Although selection is thought to be less efficient on the asexual mt genome, in bilaterian animals the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<i>ω</i>) is lower in mt- compared with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, suggesting <i>stronger</i> effects of purifying selection in the mt genome. Because high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion constrain protein sequence evolution, one proposed resolution to this paradox is that mt genes are expressed more highly than nuclear genes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated expression and sequence evolution of mt and nuclear genes from 84 diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es that vary in mt gene content and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate. We found that the relationship between mt and nuclear <i>ω</i> values varied dramatically across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>es. In contrast, transcript abundance is consistently higher for mt genes than nuclear genes, regardless of which genes happen to be in the mt genome. Consequently, expression levels cannot be responsible for the differences in <i>ω</i>. Rather, 84% of the variance in the ratio of <i>ω</i> values between mt and nuclear genes could be explained by differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion rate between the two genomes. We relate these findings to the hypothesis that high rates of mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mutat</span></strong>ion select for compensatory changes in the nuclear genome. We also propose an explanation for why mt transcripts consistently outnumber their nuclear counterparts, with implications for mitonuclear protein imbalance and aging.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prokaryot</span></strong>es in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene express</span></strong>ion and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

The AAA-ATPase MIDASIN 1 Functions in Ribosome Biogenesis and Is Essential for Embryo and Root Development
<p>Ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s is an orchestrated process that relies on many assembly factors. The AAA-ATPase Midasin 1 (Mdn1) functions as a ribosome assembly factor in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>), but the roles of MDN1 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we showed that the Arabidopsis null mutant of <i>MDN1</i> is embryo-lethal. Using the weak mutant <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i>, which maintains viability, we found that MDN1 is critical for the regular pattern of auxin maxima in the globular embryo and functions in root meristem maintenance. By detecting the subcellular distribution of ribosome proteins, we noted that <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> impairs nuclear export of the pre-60S ribosomal particle. The processing of ribosomal precusor RNAs, including 35S, 27SB, and 20S, is also affected in this mutant. MDN1 physically interacts with PESCADILLO2 (PES2), an essential assembly factor of the 60S ribosome, and the observed mislocalization of PES2 in <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> further implied that MDN1 plays an indispensable role in 60S ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s. Therefore, the observed hypersensitivity of <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eukaryot</span></strong>ic translation inhibitor and high-sugar conditions might be associated with the defect in ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s. Overall, this work establishes a role of Arabidopsis MDN1 in ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biogenesi</span></strong>s, which agrees with its roles in embryogenesis and root development.</p>

Fate map of the chicken otic placode
<p>The inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> is an intricate three-dimensional sensory organ that arises from a flat, thickened portion of the ectoderm termed the otic placode. There is evidence that the ontogenetic steps involved in the progressive specification of the highly specialized inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> of vertebrates involve the concerted actions of diverse patterning signals that originate from n<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>by tissues, providing positional identity and instructive context. The topology of the prospective inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> portions at placode stages when such patterning begins has remained largely unknown. The chick-quail model was used to perform a comprehensive fate mapping study of the chick otic placode, shedding light on the precise topological position of each presumptive inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> component relative to the dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes of the otic placode and, implicitly, to the possible sources of inducing signals. The findings reveal the existence of three dorsoventrally arranged anteroposterior domains from which the endolymphatic system, the maculae and basilar papilla, and the cristae develop. This study provides new bases for the interpretation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>lier and future descriptive and experimental studies that aim to understand the molecular genetic mechanisms involved in otic placode patterning.</p>

Zebrafish Foxi1 provides a neuronal ground state during inner ear induction preceding the Dlx3b/4b-regulated sensory lineage
<p>Vertebrate inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> development is a complex process that involves the induction of a common territory for otic and epibranchial precursors and their subsequent segregation into otic and epibranchial cell fates. In zebrafish, the otic-epibranchial progenitor domain (OEPD) is induced by Fgf signaling in a Foxi1- and Dlx3b/4b-dependent manner, but the functional differences of Foxi1 and Dlx3b/4b in subsequent cell fate specifications within the developing inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> are poorly understood. Based on pioneer tracking (PioTrack), a novel Cre-dependent genetic lineage tracing method, and genetic data, we show that the competence to embark on a neuronal or sensory fate is provided sequentially and very <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly during otic placode induction. Loss of Foxi1 prevents neuronal precursor formation without affecting hair cell specification, whereas loss of Dlx3b/4b inhibits hair cell but not neuronal precursor formation. Consistently, in Dlx3b/4b- and Sox9a-deficient <i>b380</i> mutants almost all otic epithelial fates are absent, including sensory hair cells, and the remaining otic cells adopt a neuronal fate. Furthermore, the progenitors of the anterior lateral line ganglia also arise from the OEPD in a Foxi1-dependent manner but are unaffected in the absence of Dlx3b/4b or in <i>b380</i> mutants. Thus, in addition to otic fate Foxi1 provides neuronal competence during OEPD induction prior to and independently of the Dlx3b/4b-mediated sensory fate of the developing inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>.</p>

Shifting habitat mosaics and fish production across river basins
<p>Watersheds are complex mosaics of habitats whose conditions vary across space and time as landscape features filter overriding climate forcing, yet the extent to which the reliability of ecosystem services depends on these dynamics remains unknown. We quantified how shifting habitat mosaics are expressed across a range of spatial scales within a large, free-flowing river, and how they stabilize the production of Pacific salmon that support valuable fisheries. The strontium isotope records of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> stones (otoliths) show that the relative productivity of locations across the river network, as both natal- and juvenile-r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ing habitat, varies widely among y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s and that this variability is expressed across a broad range of spatial scales, ultimately stabilizing the interannual production of fish at the scale of the entire basin.</p>

A gut feeling
<p>The anatomist Friedrich S. Merkel predicted in 1880 that sensory systems are composed of epithelial cells and sensory nerves, which together transform environmental cues into neural signals that trigger our rich sensory experiences (<i>1</i>). We now know that this hypothesis mostly holds true for the canonical senses of vision, h<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ing, taste, and touch. Perhaps surprisingly, the peripheral outposts of these classical sensory systems (eyes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s, tongue, and skin) are dwarfed by the human body's largest sensory organ—the gut. Enteroendocrine cells, which are rare epithelial cells that decorate the gut lining, have long been suspected to be sensory receptor cells that inform the brain about ingested nutrients (<i>2</i>). Since their description, these cells were assumed to play a role in metabolism and gut physiology by releasing slow-acting peptide hormones that stimulate neurons throughout the gut and in the brain. On page 1219 of this issue, Kaelberer <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) challenge this view by demonstrating that gut enteroendocrine cells locally excite sensory nerves through release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. A recent study of enterochromaffin cells, a subset of enteroendocrine cells, also found that gut signals are transmitted at epithelial-neural synapses through release of the neurotransmitter serotonin (<i>4</i>). Together, these findings overturn a decades-old dogma that enteroendocrine cells signal exclusively through hormones.</p>

The histone demethylase KDM6B regulates temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species
<p>Temperature-dependent sex determination is a notable model of phenotypic plasticity. In many reptiles, including the red-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ed slider turtle <i>Trachemys scripta elegans</i> (<i>T. scripta</i>), the individual’s sex is determined by the ambient temperature during egg incubation. In this study, we show that the histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase KDM6B exhibits temperature-dependent sexually dimorphic expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly <i>T. scripta</i> embryos before the gonad is distinct. Knockdown of <i>Kdm6b</i> at 26°C (a temperature at which all offspring develop into males) triggers male-to-female sex reversal in >80% of surviving embryos. KDM6B directly promotes the transcription of the male sex-determining gene <i>Dmrt1</i> by eliminating the trimethylation of H3K27 n<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> its promoter. Additionally, overexpression of <i>Dmrt1</i> is sufficient to rescue the sex reversal induced by disruption of <i>Kdm6b</i>. This study establishes causality and a direct genetic link between epigenetic mechanisms and temperature-dependent sex determination in a turtle species.</p>

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) isotope compositions in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative conditions in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fraction, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2-Mediated Transcriptional Repression Regulates Vegetative and Reproductive Architecture
<p>Transcriptional repression in multicellular organisms orchestrates dynamic and precise gene expression changes that enable complex developmental patterns. Here, we present phenotypic and molecular characterization of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) transcriptional corepressor RAMOSA1 ENHANCER LOCUS2 (REL2), a unique member of the highly conserved TOPLESS (TPL) family. Analysis of single recessive mutations in <i>rel2</i> revealed an array of vegetative and reproductive phenotypes, many related to defects in meristem initiation and maintenance. To better understand how REL2-mediated transcriptional complexes relate to <i>rel2</i> phenotypes, we performed protein interaction assays and transcriptional profiling of mutant inflorescences, leading to the identification of different maize transcription factors and regulatory pathways that employ REL2 repression to control traits directly impacting maize yields. In addition, we used our REL2 interaction data to catalog conserved repression motifs present on REL2 interactors and showed that two of these, RLFGV- and DLN-type motifs, interact with the C-terminal WD40 domain of REL2 rather than the N terminus, which is known to bind LxLxL EAR motifs. These findings establish that the WD40 domain of TPL family proteins is an independent protein interaction surface that may work together with the N-terminal domain to allow the formation of large macromolecular complexes of functionally related transcription factors.</p>

LNK1 and LNK2 Corepressors Interact with the MYB3 Transcription Factor in Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Subgroup 4 of R2R3-MYB transcription factors consists of four members, MYB3, MYB4, MYB7, and MYB32, which possess the conserved EAR repression motif (pdLHLD/LLxiG/S) in their C termini. Here, we show that MYB3 is a newly identified repressor in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. However, the repression mechanism of MYB3 is completely different from MYB4, MYB7, and MYB32. Yeast two-hybrid screening using MYB3 as a bait isolates NIGHT LIGHT-INDUCIBLE AND CLOCK-REGULATED1 (LNK1) and LNK2, members of a small family of four LNK proteins. The repression activity of MYB3 to cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (<i>C4H</i>) gene expression is directly regulated by corepressors LNK1 and LNK2, which could facilitate binding of MYB3 with <i>C4H</i> promoter. The two conserved Asp residues in both region 1 and 2 domain of LNKs are essential to mediate protein-protein interaction. Importantly, the Extra N-terminal Tail domain plays a negative role in LNK-MYB3 transcription complex-dependent repression of the <i>C4H</i> gene. We conclude that LNK1 and LNK2 act as transcriptional corepressors necessary for expression of the phenylpropanoids biosynthesis gene <i>C4H</i> through recruitment to its promoter via interaction with MYB3.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle motion, with particle motion dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle motion component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

At rest, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of normothermic resting bats was negatively correlated with <i>T</i><sub>a</sub>, with maximum <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of 803 beats min<sup>−1</sup> (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>=5°C). During torpor, the relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>a</sub> was curvilin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>, and at low <i>T</i><sub>sub</sub> (~6°C), <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> fell to a minimum average of 8 beats min<sup>−1</sup>. The minimum average values for both [Formula] and <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in torpor reported here were among the lowest recorded for bats. The relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and [Formula] was significant for both resting (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.64, <i>P</i><0.001) and torpid bats (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.84, <i>P</i><0.001), with no overlap between the two states. These variables were also significantly correlated (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.44, <i>P</i><0.001) for entire torpor bouts. Moreover, estimates of [Formula] from <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> did not differ significantly from measured values during the different physiological states. Our study is the first to investigate the accuracy of <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> as a predictor of [Formula] during torpor and indicates the reliability of this method as a potential measure of energy expenditure in the field. Nevertheless, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> should only be used to predict [Formula] within the range of activities for which robust correlations have been established.</p>

Complexes of Usher proteins preassemble at the endoplasmic reticulum and are required for trafficking and ER homeostasis
<p>Usher syndrome (USH), the leading cause of hereditary combined h<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ing and vision loss, is characterized by sensorineural deafness and progressive retinal degeneration. Mutations in several different genes produce USH, but the proximal cause of sensory cell death remains mysterious. We adapted a proximity ligation assay to analyze associations among three of the USH proteins, Cdh23, Harmonin and Myo7aa, and the microtubule-based transporter Ift88 in zebrafish inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> mechanosensory hair cells. We found that the proteins are in close enough proximity to form complexes and that these complexes preassemble at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Defects in any one of the three USH proteins disrupt formation and trafficking of the complex and result in diminished levels of the other proteins, generalized trafficking defects and ER stress that triggers apoptosis. ER stress, thus, contributes to sensory hair cell loss and provides a new target to explore for protective therapies for USH.</p>

Sepsis otopathy: experimental sepsis leads to significant hearing impairment due to apoptosis and glutamate excitotoxicity in murine cochlea
<p>H<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ing loss is frequent in intensive care patients and can be due to several causes. However, sepsis has not been examined as a possible cause. The aim of this study is to assess the influence of experimental sepsis on h<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ing thresholds and to evaluate pathological changes in the cochlea. The cecal ligation puncture technique was used to induce sepsis in 18 mice. Results were compared with those from 13 sham-operated and 13 untreated control mice. The h<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ing thresholds of the animals were evaluated with auditory evoked brainstem responses prior to the induction of sepsis and again at the peak of the disease. Immediately after the second measurement, the mice were sacrificed and the inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s harvested and prepared for further evaluation. The cochleae were examined with light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry for Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2.

Induction of apoptosis could be shown in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti. Furthermore, excitotoxicity could be shown at the basal pole of the inner hair cells. In this murine model, sepsis leads to significant h<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ing impairment. The physiological alteration could be linked to apoptosis in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti and to a disturbance of the synapses of the inner hair cells.</p>

Ligand-dependent Notch signaling strength orchestrates lateral induction and lateral inhibition in the developing inner ear
<p>During inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> development, Notch exhibits two modes of operation: lateral induction, which is associated with prosensory specification, and lateral inhibition, which is involved in hair cell determination. These mechanisms depend respectively on two different ligands, jagged 1 (Jag1) and delta 1 (Dl1), that rely on a common signaling cascade initiated after Notch activation. In the chicken otocyst, expression of Jag1 and the Notch target Hey1 correlates well with lateral induction, whereas both Jag1 and Dl1 are expressed during lateral inhibition, as are Notch targets Hey1 and Hes5. Here, we show that Jag1 drives lower levels of Notch activity than Dl1, which results in the differential expression of Hey1 and Hes5. In addition, Jag1 interferes with the ability of Dl1 to elicit high levels of Notch activity. Modeling the sensory epithelium when the two ligands are expressed together shows that ligand regulation, differential signaling strength and ligand competition are crucial to allow the two modes of operation and for establishing the alternate pattern of hair cells and supporting cells. Jag1, while driving lateral induction on its own, facilitates patterning by lateral inhibition in the presence of Dl1. This novel behavior emerges from Jag1 acting as a competitive inhibitor of Dl1 for Notch signaling. Both modeling and experiments show that hair cell patterning is very robust. The model suggests that autoactivation of proneural factor Atoh1, upstream of Dl1, is a fundamental component for robustness. The results stress the importance of the levels of Notch signaling and ligand competition for Notch function.</p>

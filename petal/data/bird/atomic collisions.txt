Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s cooperatively emit photons. Demonstration of controlled collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions has resulted from the ability to directly imprint correlations with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> superradiance: Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with predefined correlation traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s). Enhanced collective photoemission of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> number was less than unity. The correlation among single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s was achieved by nanometer-precision position control and phase-aligned state manipulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s by using a nanohole-array aperture. Our results demonstrate a platform for phase-controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions.</p>

Hyperfine interaction of individual atoms on a surface
<p>Taking advantage of nuclear spins for electronic structure analysis, magnetic resonance imaging, and quantum devices hinges on knowledge and control of the surrounding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic-scale environment. We measured and manipulated the hyperfine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of individual iron and titanium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s placed on a magnesium oxide surface by using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> electron spin resonance. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> manipulation to move single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, we found that the hyperfine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion strongly depended on the binding configuration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>. We could extract <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>- and position-dependent information about the electronic ground state, the state mixing with neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, and properties of the nuclear spin. Thus, the hyperfine spectrum becomes a powerful probe of the chemical environment of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and nanostructures.</p>

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host gene-NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in causing disease. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Systematic analysis of complex genetic interactions
<p>To systematically explore complex genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, we constructed ~200,000 yeast triple mutants and scored negative trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. We selected double-mutant query genes across a broad spectrum of biological processes, spanning a range of quantitative features of the global digenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network and tested for a genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with a third mutation. Trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions often occurred among functionally related genes, and essential genes were hubs on the trigenic network. Despite their functional enrichment, trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions tended to link genes in distant bioprocesses and displayed a weaker magnitude than digenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. We estimate that the global trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network is ~100 times as large as the global digenic network, highlighting the potential for complex genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions to affect the biology of inheritance, including the genotype-to-phenotype relationship.</p>

Generation of specific inhibitors of SUMO-1– and SUMO-2/3–mediated protein-protein interactions using Affimer (Adhiron) technology
<p>Because protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions underpin most biological processes, developing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the development of therapeutics is an important task. SUMOylation is the posttranslational covalent attachment of proteins in the SUMO family (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3), and it regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated proteins are recognized by proteins with SUMO-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion motifs (SIMs) that facilitate noncovalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with SUMO. We describe the use of the Affimer system of peptide display for the rapid isolation of synthetic binding proteins that inhibit SUMO-dependent protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions mediated by SIMs both in vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic proteins did not prevent SUMO conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific analysis of SUMO-mediated protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. Furthermore, through structural analysis and molecular modeling, we explored the molecular mechanisms that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO-1–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions mediated by either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Not only will these reagents enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, but the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding proteins could also be exploited to design or validate reagents or therapeutics that target other protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions.</p>

Loss of Cardioprotective Effects at the <i>ADAMTS7</i> Locus as a Result of Gene-Smoking Interactions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Common diseases such as coronary heart disease (CHD) are complex in etiology.

Isoscapes resolve species-specific spatial patterns in plant–plant interactions in an invaded Mediterranean dune ecosystem
<p>Environmental heterogeneity and plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions are key factors shaping plant communities. However, the spatial dimension of plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions has seldom been addressed in field studies. This is at least partially rooted in a lack of methods that can accurately resolve functional processes in a spatially explicit manner. Isoscapes, that is, spatially explicit representations of stable isotope data, provide a versatile means to trace functional changes on spatial scales, for example, related to N-cycling (foliar δ<sup>15</sup>N) and water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub>, foliar δ<sup>13</sup>C). In a case study in a nutrient-depleted Mediterranean dune ecosystem, we analysed the spatial impact of the invasive N<sub>2</sub>-fixing <i>Acacia longifolia</i> on three native species of different functional types using δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Isoscapes revealed strong spatial patterns in δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C with pronounced species-specific differences, demonstrating distinct spatial ranges of plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. A coniferous tree and an ericaceous dwarf shrub showed significant enrichment in δ<sup>15</sup>N within a range of 5–8 m surrounding the canopy of <i>A. longifolia</i>, indicating input of N originating from symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation by the invader. In the dwarf shrub, which was most responsive to invader influence, enrichment in δ<sup>13</sup>C additionally demonstrated spatially explicit changes to WUE<sub>i</sub>, while a native N<sub>2</sub>-fixer was unresponsive to the presence of the invader. Furthermore, δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes yielded different patterns, indicating that plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions can have distinct spatial distributions and ranges based on the process measured. Additionally, the magnitude of the effect differed between field situations with high and low invasion pressure. This study highlights that the spatial scale must be accounted for when assessing the effects and outcome of species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. Functional tracers such as stable isotopes enable us to quantify spatial ranges of plant–plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, providing empirical data that can help to better understand and predict complex species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in multifaceted natural environments.</p>

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-molecule Feshbach resonances are identified by observing an enhancement of the loss. We have observed 11 resonances in the magnetic field range of 43 to 120 gauss. The observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-molecule Feshbach resonances at ultralow temperatures probe the three-body potential energy surface with exceptional resolution and will help to improve understanding of ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collis</span></strong>ions.</p>

Creation of a Bose-condensed gas of <sup>87</sup>Rb by laser cooling
<p>Protocols for attaining quantum degeneracy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic gases almost exclusively rely on evaporative cooling, a time-consuming final step associated with substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. We demonstrate direct laser cooling of a gas of rubidium-87 (<sup>87</sup>Rb) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s to quantum degeneracy. The method is fast and induces little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s are trapped in a two-dimensional optical lattice that enables cycles of compression to increase the density, followed by Raman sideband cooling to decrease the temperature.

A global genetic interaction network maps a wiring diagram of cellular function
<p>We generated a global genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, constructing more than 23 million double mutants, identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. This comprehensive network maps genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions for essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected hubs.

Negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions connected functionally related genes, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene pairs, rather than shared functionality.

pTAC10, a Key Subunit of Plastid-Encoded RNA Polymerase, Promotes Chloroplast Development
<p>Regulation of photosynthetic gene expression by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) is essential for chloroplast development. The activity of PEP largely relies on at least 12 PEP-associated proteins (PAPs) encoded in the nuclear genome of plant cells. A recent model proposed that these PAPs regulate the establishment of the PEP complex through broad PAP-PEP or PAP-PAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. In this study, we identified the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedling-lethal mutant <i>ptac10-1</i>, which has defects in chloroplast development, and found that the mutant phenotype is caused by the suppression of <i>PLASTID S1 RNA-BINDING DOMAIN PROTEIN</i> (<i>pTAC10/PAP3</i>). Analysis of the heterozygous mutant and <i>pTAC10</i>-overexpressing transgenic plants indicated that the expression level of <i>pTAC10</i> is tightly linked to chloroplast development. Characterization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of pTAC10 with PAPs revealed that pTAC10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>s with other PAPs, such as FSD2, FSD3, TrxZ, pTAC7, and pTAC14, but it does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with PEP core enzymes, such as rpoA and rpoB. Analysis of pTAC10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions using truncated pTAC10 proteins showed that the pTAC10 carboxyl-terminal region downstream of the S1 domain is involved in the pTAC10-PAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion. Furthermore, overexpression of truncated <i>pTAC10s</i> lacking the C-terminal regions downstream of the S1 domain could not rescue the <i>ptac10-1</i> mutant phenotype and induced an abnormal whitening phenotype in Columbia-0 plants. Our observations suggested that these pTAC10-PAP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions are essential for the formation of the PEP complex and chloroplast development.</p>

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression
<p>Ion channels regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in normal and neoplastic cells through cell-cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) transmembrane receptors called integrins. K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human ether-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) channel shapes action potential firing in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in tumors, where it modulates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human cancer cells. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion. Although open hERG1 channels did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed channels, current flow through hERG1 channels was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and cancer cells. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in breast cancer cells expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas metastasis of breast cancer cells was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion was disrupted. We conclude that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 channels in cancer cells stimulated distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of tumor progression.</p>

If two deletions don't stop growth, try three
<p>How many and which genes does an organism need at a minimum to sustain growth? With the identification of essential genes in a variety of organisms such as yeast (<i>1</i>), worms (<i>2</i>), and human cultured cells (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>), the answer may seem obvious: Remove all nonessential genes, and the organism should be able to continue to survive and grow. In the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the workhorse of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion mapping, ∼1000 of the ∼6000 (∼17%) protein-coding genes are essential for viability (<i>1</i>). So theoretically, one might think that one could remove the other ∼5000 nonessential genes and still have a growing yeast. The reason this does not work is that genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with each other to drive different traits, including viability and growth. On page 283 of this issue, Kuzmin <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) provide the first systematic analysis of trigenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in yeast in which three gene deletions are combined in individual strains in order to ascertain the importance of multigene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions for growth.

Photon correlation and conditional phase measurements reveal the distinct bunching and phase features associated with three-photon and two-photon bound states.

<p>Strontium optical lattice clocks have the potential to simultaneously interrogate millions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with a high spectroscopic quality factor of 4 × 10<sup>17</sup>. Previously, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong></span></strong>ions have forced a compromise between clock stability, which benefits from a large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, and accuracy, which suffers from density-dependent frequency shifts. Here we demonstrate a scalable solution that takes advantage of the high, correlated density of a degenerate Fermi gas in a three-dimensional (3D) optical lattice to guard against on-site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion shifts. We show that contact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions are resolved so that their contribution to clock shifts is orders of magnitude lower than in previous experiments. A synchronous clock comparison between two regions of the 3D lattice yields a measurement precision of 5 × 10<sup>–19</sup> in 1 hour of averaging time.</p>

Angular momentum–induced delays in solid-state photoemission enhanced by intra-atomic interactions
<p>Attosecond time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that photoemission from solids is not yet fully understood. The relative emission delays between four photoemission channels measured for the van der Waals crystal tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) can only be explained by accounting for both propagation and intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic delays. The intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic delay depends on the angular momentum of the initial localized state and is determined by intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong></span></strong>ions. For the studied case of WSe<sub>2</sub>, the photoemission events are time ordered with rising initial-state angular momentum. Including intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic electron-electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion and angular momentum of the initial localized state yields excellent agreement between theory and experiment. This has required a revision of existing models for solid-state photoemission, and thus, attosecond time-resolved photoemission from solids provides important benchmarks for improved future photoemission models.</p>

A dedicated network for social interaction processing in the primate brain
<p>Primate cognition requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion processing. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions can reveal otherwise hidden properties of intentional agents, such as thoughts and feelings, and of inanimate objects, such as mass and material. Where and how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion analyses are implemented in the brain is unknown. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging in macaque monkeys, we discovered a network centered in the medial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex that is exclusively engaged in social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion analysis. Exclusivity of specialization was found for no other function anywhere in the brain. Two additional networks, a parieto-premotor and a temporal one, exhibited both social and physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion preference, which, in the temporal lobe, mapped onto a fine-grain pattern of object, body, and face selectivity. Extent and location of a dedicated system for social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion analysis suggest that this function is an evolutionary forerunner of human mind-reading capabilities.</p>

SIPP, a Novel Mitochondrial Phosphate Carrier, Mediates in Self-Incompatibility
<p>In Solanaceae, the <i>S</i>-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between the pistil S-RNase and the pollen <i>S</i>-Locus F-box protein controls self-incompatibility (SI). Although this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion defines the specificity of the pollen rejection response, the identification of three pistil essential modifier genes unlinked to the <i>S</i>-locus (<i>HT-B</i>, <i>120K</i>, and <i>NaStEP</i>) unveils a higher degree of complexity in the pollen rejection pathway. We showed previously that NaStEP, a stigma protein with homology with Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, is essential to SI in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. During pollination, NaStEP is taken up by pollen tubes, where potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with pollen tube proteins might underlie its function. Here, we identified NaSIPP, a mitochondrial protein with phosphate transporter activity, as a novel NaStEP-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing protein. Coexpression of NaStEP and NaSIPP in pollen tubes showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion in the mitochondria, although when expressed alone, NaStEP remains mostly cytosolic, implicating NaSIPP-mediated translocation of NaStEP into the organelle. The <i>NaSIPP</i> transcript is detected specifically in mature pollen of <i>Nicotiana</i> spp.; however, in self-compatible plants, this gene has accumulated mutations, so its coding region is unlikely to produce a functional protein. RNA interference suppression of NaSIPP in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. pollen grains disrupts the SI by preventing pollen tube inhibition. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model whereby the NaStEP and NaSIPP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion, in incompatible pollen tubes, might destabilize the mitochondria and contribute to arrest pollen tube growth.</p>

The DUF1669 domain of FAM83 family proteins anchor casein kinase 1 isoforms
<p>Members of the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of serine-threonine protein kinases are implicated in the regulation of many cellular processes, including the cell cycle, circadian rhythms, and Wnt and Hedgehog signaling. Because these kinases exhibit constitutive activity in biochemical assays, it is likely that their activity in cells is controlled by subcellular localization, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions with inhibitory proteins, targeted degradation, or combinations of these mechanisms. We identified members of the FAM83 family of proteins as partners of CK1 in cells. All eight members of the FAM83 family (FAM83A to FAM83H) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the α and α-like isoforms of CK1; FAM83A, FAM83B, FAM83E, and FAM83H also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with the δ and ε isoforms of CK1. We detected no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between any FAM83 member and the related CK1γ1, CK1γ2, and CK1γ3 isoforms. Each FAM83 protein exhibited a distinct pattern of subcellular distribution and colocalized with the CK1 isoform(s) to which it bound. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of FAM83 proteins with CK1 isoforms was mediated by the conserved domain of unknown function 1669 (DUF1669) that characterizes the FAM83 family. Mutations in FAM83 proteins that prevented them from binding to CK1 interfered with the proper subcellular localization and cellular functions of both the FAM83 proteins and their CK1 binding partners. On the basis of its function, we propose that DUF1669 be renamed the polypeptide anchor of CK1 domain.</p>

Global assessment of its network dynamics reveals that the kinase Plk1 inhibits the phosphatase PP6 to promote Aurora A activity
<p>Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an essential protein kinase that promotes faithful mitotic progression in eukaryotes. The subcellular localization and substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions of Plk1 are tightly controlled and require its binding to phosphorylated residues. To identify phosphorylation-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions within the Plk1 network in human mitotic cells, we performed quantitative proteomics on HeLa cells cultured with kinase inhibitors or expressing a Plk1 mutant that was deficient in phosphorylation-dependent substrate binding. We found that many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions were abolished upon kinase inhibition; however, a subset was protected from phosphatase opposition or was unopposed, resulting in persistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of the substrate with Plk1. This subset includes phosphoprotein phosphatase 6 (PP6), whose activity toward Aurora kinase A (Aurora A) was inhibited by Plk1. Our data suggest that this Plk1-PP6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion generates a feedback loop that coordinates and reinforces the activities of Plk1 and Aurora A during mitotic entry and is terminated by the degradation of Plk1 during mitotic exit. Thus, we have identified a mechanism for the previously puzzling observation of the Plk1-dependent regulation of Aurora A.</p>

RAF1/BRAF dimerization integrates the signal from RAS to ERK and ROKα
<p>Downstream of growth factor receptors and of the guanine triphosphatase (GTPase) RAS, heterodimers of the serine/threonine kinases BRAF and RAF1 are critical upstream kinases and activators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) module containing the mitogen-activated and extracellular signal–regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and their targets, the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) family. Either direct or scaffold protein–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions among the components of the ERK module (the MAPKKKs BRAF and RAF1, MEK, and ERK) facilitate signal transmission. RAF1 also has essential functions in the control of tumorigenesis and migration that are mediated through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion with the kinase ROKα, an effector of the GTPase RHO and regulator of cytoskeletal rearrangements. We combined mutational and kinetic analysis with mathematical modeling to show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of RAF1 with ROKα is coordinated with the role of RAF1 in the ERK pathway. We found that the phosphorylated form of RAF1 that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ed with and inhibited ROKα was generated during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of RAF1 with the ERK module. This mechanism adds plasticity to the ERK pathway, enabling signal diversification at the level of both ERK and RAF. Furthermore, by connecting ERK activation with the regulation of ROKα and cytoskeletal rearrangements by RAF1, this mechanism has the potential to precisely coordinate the proper timing of proliferation with changes in cell shape, adhesion, or motility.</p>

Gene duplication can impart fragility, not robustness, in the yeast protein interaction network

The Extra-Pathway Interactome of the TCA Cycle: Expected and Unexpected Metabolic Interactions
<p>The plant tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle provides essential precursors for respiration, amino acid biosynthesis, and general nitrogen metabolism; moreover, it is closely involved in biotic stress responses and cellular redox homeostasis. To further understand the in vivo function of the TCA cycle enzymes, we combined affinity purification with proteomics to generate a comprehensive extra-pathway protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion network of the plant TCA cycle. We identified 125 extra-pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mostly related to the mitochondrial electron transport complex/ATP synthesis and amino acid metabolism but also to proteins associated with redox stress. We chose three high-scoring and two low-scoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions for complementary bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays, which highlighted the reliability of our approach, supported the intimate involvement of TCA cycle enzymes within many biological processes, and reflected metabolic changes reported previously for the corresponding mutant lines. To analyze the function of a subset of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, we selected two mutants of mitochondrial glutaredoxin S15 and Amidase, which have not yet been analyzed with respect to their TCA cycle function, and performed metabolite profiling and flux analysis. Consistent with their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions identified in this study, TCA cycle metabolites and the relative TCA flux of the two mutants were altered significantly.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross sect</span></strong>ions of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cross sect</span></strong>ions with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 protein of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein family, which also includes the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible proteins, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix proteins and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible proteins. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion, and integration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong> with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple protein-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion analyses suggest the direct physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their protein products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both intestinal water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

High-temperature pairing in a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas

In the strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing regime, the pairing energy in the normal phase considerably exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing in this regime is driven by many-body correlations, rather than two-body physics.

Structural mechanisms of centromeric nucleosome recognition by the kinetochore protein CENP-N

Mutational analyses demonstrate analogous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions in <i>Xenopus</i>, which are further supported by residue-swapping experiments involving the L1 loop of CENP-A. Our results are consistent with the coevolution of CENP-N and CENP-A and establish the structural basis for recognition of the CENP-A nucleosome to enable kinetochore assembly and centromeric chromatin organization.</p>

Photoionization in the time and frequency domain
<p>Ultrafast processes in matter, such as the electron emission after light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion, can now be studied using ultrashort light pulses of attosecond duration (10<sup>−18</sup> seconds) in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range. The lack of spectral resolution due to the use of short light pulses has raised issues in the interpretation of the experimental results and the comparison with theoretical calculations. We determine photoionization time delays in neon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s over a 40–electron volt energy range with an interferometric technique combining high temporal and spectral resolution. We spectrally disentangle direct ionization from ionization with shake-up, in which a second electron is left in an excited state, and obtain excellent agreement with theoretical calculations, thereby solving a puzzle raised by 7-year-old measurements.</p>

Gating of social reward by oxytocin in the ventral tegmental area
<p>The reward generated by social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions is critical for promoting prosocial behaviors. Here we present evidence that oxytocin (OXT) release in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key node of the brain’s reward circuitry, is necessary to elicit social reward. During social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions, activity in paraventricular nucleus (PVN) OXT neurons increased. Direct activation of these neurons in the PVN or their terminals in the VTA enhanced prosocial behaviors. Conversely, inhibition of PVN OXT axon terminals in the VTA decreased social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions. OXT increased excitatory drive onto reward-specific VTA dopamine (DA) neurons. These results demonstrate that OXT promotes prosocial behavior through direct effects on VTA DA neurons, thus providing mechanistic insight into how social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions can generate rewarding experiences.</p>

Electronic crystal growth
<p>Interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s or molecules condense into liquid, and, when cooled further, they form a crystal. The time evolution of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic or molecular ordering has been widely studied as a nonequilibrium emergence of order from a supercooled liquid or a glass. Interacting electrons in a variety of correlated electron systems also form crystals, but observing the time evolution of electronic crystallization has been experimentally challenging. Here, working with an organic conductor exhibiting a supercooled charge liquid or charge glass as a metastable state, we observed electronic crystal growth through resistivity and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The temperature profile of the crystal growth is similar to those observed in classical systems and reveals two distinct regimes for the mechanism of electronic crystallization.</p>

Higher predation risk for insect prey at low latitudes and elevations
<p>Biotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions underlie ecosystem structure and function, but predicting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion outcomes is difficult. We tested the hypothesis that biotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion strength increases toward the equator, using a global experiment with model caterpillars to measure predation risk. Across an 11,660-kilometer latitudinal gradient spanning six continents, we found increasing predation toward the equator, with a parallel pattern of increasing predation toward lower elevations. Patterns across both latitude and elevation were driven by arthropod predators, with no systematic trend in attack rates by birds or mammals. These matching gradients at global and regional scales suggest consistent drivers of biotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion strength, a finding that needs to be integrated into general theories of herbivory, community organization, and life-history evolution.</p>

Deterministic entanglement generation from driving through quantum phase transitions
<p>Many-body entanglement is often created through the system evolution, aided by nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions between the constituting particles. These very dynamics, however, can also lead to fluctuations and degradation of the entanglement if the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions cannot be controlled. Here, we demonstrate near-deterministic generation of an entangled twin-Fock condensate of ~11,000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s by driving a<sub> </sub>arubidium-87 Bose-Einstein condensate undergoing spin mixing through two consecutive quantum phase transitions (QPTs). We directly observe number squeezing of 10.7 ± 0.6 decibels and normalized collective spin length of 0.99 ± 0.01. Together, these observations allow us to infer an entanglement-enhanced phase sensitivity of ~6 decibels beyond the standard quantum limit and an entanglement breadth of ~910 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. Our work highlights the power of generating large-scale useful entanglement by taking advantage of the different entanglement landscapes separated by QPTs.</p>

Emergence of hierarchical structural complexities in nanoparticles and their assembly
<p>We demonstrate that nanoparticle self-assembly can reach the same level of hierarchy, complexity, and accuracy as biomolecules. The precise assembly structures of gold nanoparticles (246 gold core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with 80 <i>p</i>-methylbenzenethiolate surface ligands) at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic, molecular, and nanoscale levels were determined from x-ray diffraction studies. We identified the driving forces and rules that guide the multiscale assembly behavior. The protecting ligands self-organize into rotational and parallel patterns on the nanoparticle surface via C-H⋅⋅⋅π <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion, and the symmetry and density of surface patterns dictate directional packing of nanoparticles into crystals with orientational, rotational, and translational orders. Through hierarchical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions and symmetry matching, the simple building blocks evolve into complex structures, representing an emergent phenomenon in the nanoparticle system.</p>

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom
<p>Integrated nonreciprocal optical components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagation direction, are key for routing signals in photonic circuits. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum optical circulator operated by a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ion between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> controls the operation direction of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level. This enables, for example, photon number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable integrated optical circuits.</p>

Single-molecule optomechanics in “picocavities”
<p>Trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffraction limit and can confine light to volumes typically on the order of 30 cubic nanometers. We found that individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features inside the gap of a plasmonic nanoassembly can localize light to volumes well below 1 cubic nanometer (“picocavities”), enabling optical experiments on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic scale. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features are dynamically formed and disassembled by laser irradiation. Although unstable at room temperature, picocavities can be stabilized at cryogenic temperatures, allowing single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic cavities to be probed for many minutes. Unlike traditional optomechanical resonators, such extreme optical confinement yields a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> enhancement of optomechanical coupling between the picocavity field and vibrations of individual molecular bonds. This work sets the basis for developing nanoscale nonlinear quantum optics on the single-molecule level.</p>

Ultrafast many-body interferometry of impurities coupled to a Fermi sea
<p>The fastest possible collective response of a quantum many-body system is related to its excitations at the highest possible energy. In condensed matter systems, the time scale for such “ultrafast” processes is typically set by the Fermi energy. Taking advantage of fast and precise control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions between ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, we observed nonequilibrium dynamics of impurities coupled to an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic Fermi sea. Our interferometric measurements track the nonperturbative quantum evolution of a fermionic many-body system, revealing in real time the formation dynamics of quasi-particles and the quantum interference between attractive and repulsive states throughout the full depth of the Fermi sea. Ultrafast time-domain methods applied to strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ing quantum gases enable the study of the dynamics of quantum matter under extreme nonequilibrium conditions.</p>

Realization of two-dimensional spin-orbit coupling for Bose-Einstein condensates
<p>Cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with laser-induced spin-orbit (SO) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions provide a platform to explore quantum physics beyond natural conditions of solids. Here we propose and experimentally realize two-dimensional (2D) SO coupling and topological bands for a rubidium-87 degenerate gas through an optical Raman lattice, without phase-locking or fine-tuning of optical potentials. A controllable crossover between 2D and 1D SO couplings is studied, and the SO effects and nontrivial band topology are observed by measuring the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic cloud distribution and spin texture in momentum space. Our realization of 2D SO coupling with advantages of small heating and topological stability opens a broad avenue in cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s to study exotic quantum phases, including topological superfluids.</p>

Real-space imaging of molecular structure and chemical bonding by single-molecule inelastic tunneling probe
<p>The arrangement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and bonds in a molecule influences its physical and chemical properties. The scanning tunneling microscope can provide electronic and vibrational signatures of single molecules. However, these signatures do not relate simply to the molecular structure and bonding. We constructed an inelastic tunneling probe based on the scanning tunneling microscope to sense the local potential energy landscape of an adsorbed molecule with a carbon monoxide (CO)–terminated tip. The skeletal structure and bonding of the molecule are revealed from imaging the spatial variations of a CO vibration as the CO-terminated tip probes the core of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interact</span></strong>ions between adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. An application of the inelastic tunneling probe reveals the sharing of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s among multiple centers in intramolecular and extramolecular bonding.</p>

Edge Nonlinear Optics on a MoS<sub>2</sub> Atomic Monolayer
<sec><title>Optics On the Edge</title><p>The ability to isolate stable materials just one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> thick has provided the impetus for a new generation of thin films technologies. Often, the materials are conceptually imaged in the form of an artist's impression as single continuous layers—a single crystal sheet of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. Scanning probe and transmission electron microscopies reveal the reality, however, where the material resembles a patchwork quilt with polycrystals of different orientation and size separated by grain boundaries forming a mosaic. These structures play an influential role in determining the transport and optical properties of the membrane. <bold>Yin <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 488; see the Perspective by <bold>Neshev and Kivshar</bold>) demonstrate a simple microscopy technique based on the nonlinear optical response of the materials to probe and characterize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin layers of MoS<sub>2</sub>. The technique should prove useful during the characterization and optimization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin membranes.</p></sec>

Aging impairs both primary and secondary RIG-I signaling for interferon induction in human monocytes
<p>Adults older than 65 account for most of the deaths caused by respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infections, but the underlying mechanisms for this susceptibility are poorly understood. IAV RNA is detected by the cytosolic sensor retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I), which induces the production of type I interferons (IFNs) that curtail the spread of the virus and promote the elimination of infected cells. We have previously identified a marked defect in the IAV-inducible secretion of type I IFNs, but not proinflammatory cytokines, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older (>65 years) healthy human donors. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older adults exhibited decreased abundance of the adaptor protein TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3) because of its increased proteasomal degradation with age, thereby impairing the primary RIG-I signaling pathway for the induction of type I IFNs. We determined that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older adults also failed to effectively stimulate the production of the IFN regulatory transcription factor IRF8, which compromised IFN induction through secondary RIG-I signaling. IRF8 played a central role in IFN induction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es, because knocking down IRF8 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from younger adults was sufficient to replicate the IFN defects observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older adults, whereas restoring IRF8 expression in older adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es was sufficient to restore RIG-I–induced IFN responses. Aging thus compromises both the primary and secondary RIG-I signaling pathways that govern expression of type I IFN genes, thereby impairing antiviral resistance to IAV.</p>

Transferrin receptor 1 is a reticulocyte-specific receptor for <i>Plasmodium vivax</i>
<p><i>Plasmodium vivax</i> shows a strict host tropism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reticulocyt</span></strong>es. We identified transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) as the receptor for <i>P. vivax</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reticulocyt</span></strong>e-binding protein 2b (PvRBP2b). We determined the structure of the N-terminal domain of PvRBP2b involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood cel</span></strong></span></strong>l binding, elucidating the molecular basis for TfR1 recognition. We validated TfR1 as the biological target of PvRBP2b engagement by means of TfR1 expression knockdown analysis. TfR1 mutant cells deficient in PvRBP2b binding were refractory to invasion of <i>P. vivax</i> but not to invasion of <i>P. falciparum</i>. Using Brazilian and Thai clinical isolates, we show that PvRBP2b monoclonal antibodies that inhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reticulocyt</span></strong>e binding also block <i>P. vivax</i> entry into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reticulocyt</span></strong>es.

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carboxy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong></span></strong> (COHb), formed by CO binding to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong>, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> concentration. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Splenic leukocytes define the resolution of inflammation in heart failure
<p>Inflammation promotes healing in myocardial infarction but, if unresolved, leads to heart failure. To define the inflammatory and resolving responses, we quantified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>e trafficking and specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) in the infarcted left ventricle and spleen after myocardial infarction, with the goal of distinguishing inflammation from its resolution. Our data suggest that the spleen not only served as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>e reservoir but also was the site where SPMs were actively generated after coronary ligation in mice. Before myocardial infarction, SPMs were more abundant in the spleen than in the left ventricle. At day 1 after coronary ligation, the spleen was depleted of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es, a phenomenon that was associated with greater numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es in the infarcted left ventricle and increased generation of SPMs at the same site, particularly resolvins, maresin, lipoxins, and protectin. In addition, the infarcted left ventricle showed increased expression of genes encoding lipoxygenases and enhanced production of SPMs generated by these enzymes. We found that macrophages were necessary for SPM generation. The abundance of SPMs in the spleen before myocardial infarction and increased SPM concentrations in the infarcted left ventricle within 24 hours after myocardial infarction were temporally correlated with the resolution of inflammation. Thus, the acute inflammatory response coincided with the active resolving phase in post–myocardial infarction and suggests that further investigation into macrophage-derived SPMs in heart failure is warranted.</p>

Ischemic Cerebroprotection Conferred by Myeloid Lineage-Restricted or Global CD39 Transgene Expression
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral tissue damage after an ischemic event can be exacerbated by inflammation and thrombosis. Elevated extracellular ATP and ADP levels are associated with cellular injury, inflammation, and thrombosis. Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (CD39), an enzyme expressed on the plasmalemma of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es and endothelial cells, suppresses platelet activation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>e infiltration by phosphohydrolyzing ATP/ADP. To investigate the effects of increased CD39 in an in vivo cerebral ischemia model, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing human CD39 (hCD39).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A floxed-stop sequence was inserted between the promoter and the hCD39 transcriptional start site, generating a mouse in which the expression of hCD39 can be controlled tissue-specifically using Cre recombinase mice.

Networks of enzymatically oxidized membrane lipids support calcium-dependent coagulation factor binding to maintain hemostasis
<p>Blood coagulation functions as part of the innate immune system by preventing bacterial invasion, and it is critical to stopping blood loss (hemostasis). Coagulation involves the external membrane surface of activated platelets and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es. Using lipidomic, genetic, biochemical, and mathematical modeling approaches, we found that enzymatically oxidized phospholipids (eoxPLs) generated by the activity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>e or platelet lipoxygenases (LOXs) were required for normal hemostasis and promoted coagulation factor activities in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phosphatidylserine (PS)–dependent manner. In wild-type mice, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid–phospholipids (HETE-PLs) enhanced coagulation and restored normal hemostasis in clotting-deficient animals genetically lacking p12-LOX or 12/15-LOX activity. Murine platelets generated 22 eoxPL species, all of which were missing in the absence of p12-LOX. Humans with the thrombotic disorder antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) had statistically significantly increased HETE-PLs in platelets and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es, as well as greater HETE-PL immunoreactivity, than healthy controls. HETE-PLs enhanced membrane binding of the serum protein β2GP1 (β2-glycoprotein 1), an event considered central to the autoimmune reactivity responsible for APS symptoms. Correlation network analysis of 47 platelet eoxPL species in platelets from APS and control subjects identified their enzymatic origin and revealed a complex network of regulation, with the abundance of 31 p12-LOX–derived eoxPL molecules substantially increased in APS. In summary, circulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood cel</span></strong>ls generate networks of eoxPL molecules, including HETE-PLs, which change membrane properties to enhance blood coagulation and contribute to the excessive clotting and immunoreactivity of patients with APS.</p>

A cluster of immunoresolvents links coagulation to innate host defense in human blood
<p>Blood coagulation is a protective response that prevents excessive bleeding upon blood vessel injury. We investigated the relationship between coagulation and the resolution of inflammation and infection by lipid mediators (LMs) through metabololipidomics-based profiling of human whole blood (WB) during coagulation. We identified temporal clusters of endogenously produced prothrombotic and proinflammatory LMs (eicosanoids), as well as specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs). In addition to eicosanoids, a specific SPM cluster was identified that consisted of resolvin E1 (RvE1), RvD1, RvD5, lipoxin B<sub>4</sub>, and maresin 1, each of which was present at bioactive concentrations (0.1 to 1 nM). Removal of adenosine from the coagulating blood markedly enhanced the amounts of SPMs produced and further increased the biosynthesis of RvD3, RvD4, and RvD6. The cyclooxygenase inhibitors celecoxib and indomethacin, which block the production of thromboxanes and prostanoids, did not block the production of clot-driven SPMs. Unbiased mass cytometry analysis demonstrated that the SPM cluster produced in human blood targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es at the single-cell level, directly activating ERK and CREB signaling in neutrophils and CD14<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es. Treatment of human WB with the components of this SPM cluster enhanced both the phagocytosis and killing of <i>Escherichia coli</i> by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es. Together, these data identify a proresolving LM circuit, including endogenous molecular brakes and accelerators, which promoted host defense. These temporal LM-SPM clusters can provide accessible metabolomic profiles for precision and personalized medicine.</p>

Key determinants of selective binding and activation by the monocyte chemoattractant proteins at the chemokine receptor CCR2
<p>Chemokines and their receptors collectively orchestrate the trafficking of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es in normal immune function and inflammatory diseases. Different chemokines can induce distinct responses at the same receptor. In comparison to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>e chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1; also known as CCL2), the chemokines MCP-2 (CCL8) and MCP-3 (CCL7) are partial agonists of their shared receptor CCR2, a key regulator of the trafficking of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es and macrophages that contribute to the pathology of atherosclerosis, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Through experiments with chimeras of MCP-1 and MCP-3, we identified the chemokine amino-terminal region as being the primary determinant of both the binding and signaling selectivity of these two chemokines at CCR2. Analysis of CCR2 mutants showed that the chemokine amino terminus interacts with the major subpocket in the transmembrane helical bundle of CCR2, which is distinct from the interactions of some other chemokines with the minor subpockets of their receptors. These results suggest the major subpocket as a target for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of CCR2.</p>

Astrocyte-shed extracellular vesicles regulate the peripheral leukocyte response to inflammatory brain lesions
<p>Brain injury induces a peripheral acute cytokine response that directs the transmigration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es into the brain. Because this brain-to-peripheral immune communication affects patient recovery, understanding its regulation is important. Using a mouse model of inflammatory brain injury, we set out to find a soluble mediator for this phenomenon. We found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed from astrocytes in response to intracerebral injection of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) rapidly entered into peripheral circulation and promoted the transmigration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es through modulation of the peripheral acute cytokine response. Bioinformatic analysis of the protein and microRNA cargo of EVs identified peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) as a primary molecular target of astrocyte-shed EVs. We confirmed in mice that astrocytic EVs promoted the transmigration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es into the brain by inhibiting PPARα, resulting in the increase of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity that triggered the production of cytokines in liver. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms regulating communication between the brain and peripheral immune system and identify astrocytic EVs as a molecular regulator of the immunological response to inflammatory brain damage.</p>

UBE2O remodels the proteome during terminal erythroid differentiation
<p>During terminal differentiation, the global protein complement is remodeled, as epitomized by erythrocytes, whose cytosol is ~98% globin. The erythroid proteome undergoes a rapid transition at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reticulocyt</span></strong>e stage; however, the mechanisms driving programmed elimination of preexisting cytosolic proteins are unclear. We found that a mutation in the murine <i>Ube2o</i> gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme induced during erythropoiesis, results in anemia. Proteomic analysis suggested that UBE2O is a broad-spectrum ubiquitinating enzyme that remodels the erythroid proteome. In particular, ribosome elimination, a hallmark of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reticulocyt</span></strong>e differentiation, was defective in <i>Ube2o<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants. UBE2O recognized ribosomal proteins and other substrates directly, targeting them to proteasomes for degradation. Thus, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reticulocyt</span></strong>es, the induction of ubiquitinating factors may drive the transition from a complex to a simple proteome.</p>

Cardioprotective Role of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in Heart Failure

Hypertrophic markers and inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA, real-time polymerase chain reaction, or Western blot.

Furthermore, MDSCs derived from patients with HF inhibited T-cell proliferation and interferon-γ secretion. Similar results were observed in TAC- and isoproterenol-induced HF in mice. Pharmaceutical depletion of MDSCs significantly exacerbated isoproterenol- and TAC-induced pathological cardiac remodeling and inflammation, whereas adoptive transfer of MDSCs prominently rescued isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF. Consistently, administration of rapamycin significantly increased endogenous MDSCs by suppressing their differentiation and improved isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF, but MDSC depletion mostly blocked beneficial rapamycin-mediated effects. Mechanistically, MDSC-secreted molecules suppressed isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy and proinflammatory gene expression in cardiomyocytes in a coculture system. Neutralization of interleukin-10 blunted both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>ic MDSC- and granulocytic MDSC–mediated anti-inflammatory and antihypertrophic effects, but treatment with a nitric oxide inhibitor only partially blocked the antihypertrophic effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>ic MDSCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings revealed a cardioprotective role of MDSCs in HF by their antihypertrophic effects on cardiomyocytes and anti-inflammatory effects through interleukin-10 and nitric oxide.

Cholesterol sulfate is a DOCK2 inhibitor that mediates tissue-specific immune evasion in the eye
<p>Although immune responses are essential to protect the body from infection, they can also harm tissues. Certain tissues and organs, including the eye, constitute specialized microenvironments that locally inhibit immune reactivity. Dedicator of cytokinesis protein 2 (DOCK2) is a Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is predominantly found in hematopoietic cells. DOCK2 plays a key role in immune surveillance because it is essential for the activation and migration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es. <i>DOCK2</i> mutations cause severe immunodeficiency in humans. We found that DOCK2-mediated Rac activation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>e migration were effectively inhibited by cholesterol sulfate (CS), but not by cholesterol or other sulfated steroids. CS bound to the catalytic domain of DOCK2 and suppressed its GEF activity. Mass spectrometric quantification revealed that CS was most abundantly produced in the Harderian gland, which provides the lipids that form the oily layer of the tear film. Sulfation of cholesterol is mediated by the sulfotransferases SULT2B1b and, to a lesser extent, SULT2B1a, which are produced from the same gene through alternative splicing. By genetically inactivating <i>Sult2b1</i>, we showed that the lack of CS in mice augmented ultraviolet- and antigen-induced ocular surface inflammation, which was suppressed by administration of eye drops containing CS. Thus, CS is a naturally occurring DOCK2 inhibitor and contributes to the generation of the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the eye.</p>

PI3Kγ activity in leukocytes promotes adipose tissue inflammation and early-onset insulin resistance during obesity

PI3Kγ plays an important role in diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. In seeking to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms, we showed that PI3Kγ action in high-fat diet–induced inflammation and insulin resistance depended largely on its role in the control of adiposity, which was due to PI3Kγ activity in a nonhematopoietic cell type. However, PI3Kγ activity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es was required for efficient neutrophil recruitment to adipose tissue. Neutrophil recruitment was correlated with proinflammatory gene expression in macrophages in adipose tissue, which triggered insulin resistance early during the development of obesity. Our data challenge the concept that PI3Kγ is a general suppressor of classical macrophage activation and indicate that PI3Kγ controls macrophage gene expression by non–cell-autonomous mechanisms, the outcome of which is context-dependent.</p>

Chronic TLR7 and TLR9 signaling drives anemia via differentiation of specialized hemophagocytes

Erythrocytic ferroportin reduces intracellular iron accumulation, hemolysis, and malaria risk

Anemia often accompanies malaria disease; however, iron supplementation therapy inexplicably exacerbates malarial infections. Here we found that the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) was highly abundant in RBCs, and iron supplementation suppressed its activity. Conditional deletion of the <i>Fpn</i> gene in erythroid cells resulted in accumulation of excess intracellular iron, cellular damage, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemolysi</span></strong>s, and increased fatality in malaria-infected mice. In humans, a prevalent <i>FPN</i> mutation, Q248H (glutamine to histidine at position 248), prevented hepcidin-induced degradation of FPN and protected against severe malaria disease. <i>FPN </i>Q248H appears to have been positively selected in African populations in response to the impact of malaria disease. Thus, FPN protects RBCs against oxidative stress and malaria infection.</p>

New developments for protein quality control
<p>The cellular proteome is maintained by a dynamic balance between protein synthesis and degradation, known as proteostasis. An imperative of successful proteostasis is the detection and removal of misfolded proteins by quality control pathways. Proteins that result from translation errors, misfolding, or age-induced or chemical damage, as well as orphan proteins (which result from inappropriate stoichiometry of multiprotein complexes), are all subject to a variety of degradative pathways to limit their cellular accumulation, which can be toxic (<i>1</i>). One of the striking features of degradative quality control is the juxtaposition of high specificity for misfolded versions of normal proteins with the very broad range of substrates that can be accommodated by each pathway. On pages 472 and 471 of this issue, Yanagitani <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) and Nguyen <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>), respectively, show that a newly discovered quality control pathway is used to bring about the sweeping changes in proteome content that are observed in the differentiation of relatively “cellular” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reticulocyt</span></strong>es to the highly specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong>-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood cel</span></strong></span></strong>ls (erythrocytes) (<i>4</i>, <i>5</i>).</p>

<p>Dendritic cells (DCs) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es play a central role in pathogen sensing, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation and consist of multiple specialized subtypes. However, their identities and interrelationships are not fully understood. Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of ~2400 cells, we identified six human DCs and four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>e subtypes in human blood. Our study reveals a new DC subset that shares properties with plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) but potently activates T cells, thus redefining pDCs; a new subdivision within the CD1C<sup>+</sup> subset of DCs; the relationship between blastic plasmacytoid DC neoplasia cells and healthy DCs; and circulating progenitor of conventional DCs (cDCs). Our revised taxonomy will enable more accurate functional and developmental analyses as well as immune monitoring in health and disease.</p>

Predictable convergence in hemoglobin function has unpredictable molecular underpinnings
<p>To investigate the predictability of genetic adaptation, we examined the molecular basis of convergence in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> function in comparisons involving 56 avian taxa that have contrasting altitudinal range limits. Convergent increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong>-oxygen affinity were pervasive among high-altitude taxa, but few such changes were attributable to parallel amino acid substitutions at key residues. Thus, predictable changes in biochemical phenotype do not have a predictable molecular basis. Experiments involving resurrected ancestral proteins revealed that historical substitutions have context-dependent effects, indicating that possible adaptive solutions are contingent on prior history. Mutations that produce an adaptive change in one species may represent precluded possibilities in other species because of differences in genetic background.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including immune function. Accordingly, immune traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in immunity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive immunity by measuring hemagglutination, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemolysi</span></strong>s, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured immune indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemolysi</span></strong>s and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive immunity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some immune measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive immunity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in immune function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Improving the accuracy of synovial fluid analysis in the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection with simple and inexpensive biomarkers
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to increase the diagnostic accuracy   of the analysis of synovial fluid in the differentiation of prosthetic   joint infection (PJI) by the addition of inexpensive biomarkers   such as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), adenosine deaminase   (ADA), alpha-2-macrogloblulin (α2M) and procalcitonin.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between January 2013 and December 2015, synovial fluid and removed   implants were requested from 143 revision total joint arthroplasties.   A total of 55 patients met inclusion criteria of the receipt of   sufficient synovial fluid, tissue samples and removed implants for   analysis.</p><p>The diagnosis of PJI followed the definition from a recent International   Consensus Meeting to create two groups of patients; septic and aseptic.   Using receiver operating characteristic curves we determined the   cutoff values and diagnostic accuracy for each marker.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 23 PJIs and 32 patients with aseptic loosening. The   levels of total leucocyte count, proportion of polymorphonuclear   leucocytes (PMNs), CRP, ADA and α2M in the synovial fluid were all   significantly higher in those with a PJI than in those with aseptic   loosening. The levels of procalcitonin were comparable in the two   groups.</p><p>Cutoff values for the optimal performance in the diagnosis of   infection were: total leucocyte count > 1463 cells/μL (sensitivity   (Sens) 100%, specificity (Spec) 71.9%, positive predictive value   (PPV) 71.9%, negative predictive value (NPV) 100%); proportion of   PMNs > 81% (Sens 78.3%, Spec 75.0%, PPV 69.2%, NPV 82.8%); CRP >   6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 93.8%, PPV 90.0%, NPV 85.7%); ADA > 61U/L   (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%) and α2M > 958 mg/L   (Sens 47.8%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 91.7%, NPV 72.1%).</p><p>The addition of a raised level of CRP or ADA to the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>e   count increased the specificity: total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>e count > 1463 cells/μL   and CRP > 6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 86.5%) or   with ADA > 61U/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The total leucocyte count in the synovial fluid offers great   negative predictive value in the diagnosis of PJI and the addition   of more specific markers such as CRP and ADA improves the positive   predictive value.

EphA2 Expression Regulates Inflammation and Fibroproliferative Remodeling in Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerotic plaque formation results from chronic inflammation and fibroproliferative remodeling in the vascular wall. We previously demonstrated that both human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques show elevated expression of EphA2, a guidance molecule involved in cell-cell interactions and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we assessed the role of EphA2 in atherosclerosis by deleting EphA2 in a mouse model of atherosclerosis (Apoe<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup>) and by assessing EphA2 function in multiple vascular cell culture models. After 8 to 16 weeks on a Western diet, male and female mice were assessed for atherosclerotic burden in the large vessels, and plasma lipid levels were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Despite enhanced weight gain and plasma lipid levels compared with Apoe<sup>−/−</sup> controls, EphA2<sup>−/−</sup>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup> knockout mice show diminished atherosclerotic plaque formation, characterized by reduced proinflammatory gene expression and plaque macrophage content. Although plaque macrophages express EphA2, EphA2 deletion does not affect macrophage phenotype, inflammatory responses, and lipid uptake, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> chimeras suggest that hematopoietic EphA2 deletion does not affect plaque formation. In contrast, endothelial EphA2 knockdown significantly reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>e firm adhesion under flow. In addition, EphA2<sup>−/−</sup>Apoe<sup>−/−</sup> mice show reduced progression to advanced atherosclerotic plaques with diminished smooth muscle and collagen content. Consistent with this phenotype, EphA2 shows enhanced expression after smooth muscle transition to a synthetic phenotype, and EphA2 depletion reduces smooth muscle proliferation, mitogenic signaling, and extracellular matrix deposition both in atherosclerotic plaques and in vascular smooth muscle cells in culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Together, these data identify a novel role for EphA2 in atherosclerosis, regulating both plaque inflammation and progression to advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Cell culture studies suggest that endothelial EphA2 contributes to atherosclerotic inflammation by promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>e firm adhesion, whereas smooth muscle EphA2 expression may regulate the progression to advanced atherosclerosis by regulating smooth muscle proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition.</p></sec>

Vascular CXCR4 Limits Atherosclerosis by Maintaining Arterial Integrity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine ligand/receptor axis controls (progenitor) cell homeostasis and trafficking. So far, an atheroprotective role of CXCL12/CXCR4 has only been implied through pharmacological intervention, in particular, because the somatic deletion of the <i>CXCR4</i> gene in mice is embryonically lethal. Moreover, cell-specific effects of CXCR4 in the arterial wall and underlying mechanisms remain elusive, prompting us to investigate the relevance of CXCR4 in vascular cell types for atheroprotection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined the role of vascular CXCR4 in atherosclerosis and plaque composition by inducing an endothelial cell (BmxCreER<sup>T2</sup>-driven)–specific or smooth muscle cell (SMC, SmmhcCreER<sup>T2</sup>- or TaglnCre-driven)–specific deficiency of <i>CXCR4</i> in an apolipoprotein E–deficient mouse model. To identify underlying mechanisms for effects of CXCR4, we studied endothelial permeability, intravital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>e adhesion, involvement of the Akt/WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and relevant phosphatases in VE-cadherin expression and function, vascular tone in aortic rings, cholesterol efflux from macrophages, and expression of SMC phenotypic markers. Finally, we analyzed associations of common genetic variants at the <i>CXCR4</i> locus with the risk for coronary heart disease, along with <i>CXCR4</i> transcript expression in human atherosclerotic plaques.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cell-specific deletion of <i>CXCR4</i> in arterial endothelial cells (n=12–15) or SMCs (n=13–24) markedly increased atherosclerotic lesion formation in hyperlipidemic mice. Endothelial barrier function was promoted by CXCL12/CXCR4, which triggered Akt/WNT/β-catenin signaling to drive VE-cadherin expression and stabilized junctional VE-cadherin complexes through associated phosphatases. Conversely, endothelial <i>CXCR4</i> deficiency caused arterial leakage and inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>e recruitment during atherogenesis. In arterial SMCs, CXCR4 sustained normal vascular reactivity and contractile responses, whereas <i>CXCR4</i> deficiency favored a synthetic phenotype, the occurrence of macrophage-like SMCs in the lesions, and impaired cholesterol efflux. Regression analyses in humans (n=259 796) identified the C-allele at <i>rs2322864</i> within the <i>CXCR4</i> locus to be associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease. In line, C/C risk genotype carriers showed reduced CXCR4 expression in carotid artery plaques (n=188), which was furthermore associated with symptomatic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data clearly establish that vascular CXCR4 limits atherosclerosis by maintaining arterial integrity, preserving endothelial barrier function, and a normal contractile SMC phenotype. Enhancing these beneficial functions of arterial CXCR4 by selective modulators might open novel therapeutic options in atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K Is Linked to Immunity and Inflammation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Immune dysregulation has been linked to occlusive vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is hereditary, idiopathic, or associated with other conditions. Circulating autoantibodies, lung perivascular lymphoid tissue, and elevated cytokines have been related to PAH pathogenesis but without a clear understanding of how these abnormalities are initiated, perpetuated, and connected in the progression of disease. We therefore set out to identify specific target antigens in PAH lung immune complexes as a starting point toward resolving these issues to better inform future application of immunomodulatory therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lung immune complexes were isolated and PAH target antigens were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and localized by confocal microscopy. One PAH antigen linked to immunity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and lung studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate immune factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in immune complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control lungs. Elevated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control lungs (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were elevated in PAH versus control lungs (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an interleukin 6-independent manner. Furthermore, 3 weekly injections of HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced hemodynamic and vascular changes of pulmonary hypertension in rats (n=8) and elevated interleukin 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study reveals that upregulation of the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K could both initiate and sustain activation of the immune system and cause vascular changes associated with PAH.</p></sec>

EMC10 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Protein Complex Subunit 10) Is a Bone Marrow–Derived Angiogenic Growth Factor Promoting Tissue Repair After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> cell–based therapies after acute myocardial infarction (MI) have produced mostly neutral results. Treatment with specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> cell–derived secreted proteins may provide an alternative biological approach to improving tissue repair and heart function after MI. We recently performed a bioinformatic secretome analysis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> cells from patients with acute MI and discovered a poorly characterized secreted protein, EMC10 (endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex subunit 10), showing activity in an angiogenic screen.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the angiogenic potential of EMC10 and its mouse homolog (Emc10) in cultured endothelial cells and infarcted heart explants.

Furthermore, we explored the therapeutic potential of recombinant Emc10 delivered by osmotic minipumps after MI in heart failure–prone FVB/N mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Emc10 signaled through small GTPases, p21-activated kinase, and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)–MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) pathway to promote actin polymerization and endothelial cell migration. Confirming the importance of these signaling events in the context of acute MI, Emc10 stimulated endothelial cell outgrowth from infarcted mouse heart explants via p38 MAPK-MK2. Emc10 protein abundance was increased in the infarcted region of the left ventricle and in the circulation of wild-type mice after MI. Emc10 expression was also increased in left ventricular tissue samples from patients with acute MI. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong>–derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es and macrophages were the predominant sources of Emc10 in the infarcted murine heart. <i>Emc10</i> KO mice showed no cardiovascular phenotype at baseline. After MI, however, capillarization of the infarct border zone was impaired in KO mice, and the animals developed larger infarct scars and more pronounced left ventricular remodeling compared with wild-type mice. Transplanting KO mice with wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> cells rescued the angiogenic defect and ameliorated left ventricular remodeling. Treating FVB/N mice with recombinant Emc10 enhanced infarct border-zone capillarization and exerted a sustained beneficial effect on left ventricular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have identified Emc10 as a previously unknown angiogenic growth factor that is produced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong>–derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es and macrophages as part of an endogenous adaptive response that can be enhanced therapeutically to repair the heart after MI.</p></sec>

Multicellular Transcriptional Analysis of Mammalian Heart Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The inability of the adult mammalian heart to regenerate following injury represents a major barrier in cardiovascular medicine. In contrast, the neonatal mammalian heart retains a transient capacity for regeneration, which is lost shortly after birth. Defining the molecular mechanisms that govern regenerative capacity in the neonatal period remains a central goal in cardiac biology. Here, we assemble a transcriptomic framework of multiple cardiac cell populations during postnatal development and following injury, which enables comparative analyses of the regenerative (neonatal) versus nonregenerative (adult) state for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>es, and endothelial cells from infarcted and noninfarcted neonatal (P1) and adult (P56) mouse hearts were isolated by enzymatic dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting at day 3 following surgery.

To complement our transcriptomic data, we also surveyed the epigenetic landscape of cardiomyocytes during postnatal maturation by performing deep sequencing of accessible chromatin regions by using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin from purified mouse cardiomyocyte nuclei (P1, P14, and P56).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Profiling of cardiomyocyte and nonmyocyte transcriptional programs uncovered several injury-responsive genes across regenerative and nonregenerative time points.

Two distinct interstitial macrophage populations coexist across tissues in specific subtissular niches
<p>Macrophages are a heterogeneous cell population involved in tissue homeostasis, inflammation, and various pathologies. Although the major tissue-resident macrophage populations have been extensively studied, interstitial macrophages (IMs) residing within the tissue parenchyma remain poorly defined. Here we studied IMs from murine lung, fat, heart, and dermis. We identified two independent IM subpopulations that are conserved across tissues: Lyve1<sup>lo</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup>CX3CR1<sup>hi</sup> (Lyve1<sup>lo</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup>) and Lyve1<sup>hi</sup>MHCII<sup>lo</sup>CX3CR1<sup>lo</sup> (Lyve1<sup>hi</sup>MHCII<sup>lo</sup>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>e-derived IMs, with distinct gene expression profiles, phenotypes, functions, and localizations. Using a new mouse model of inducible macrophage depletion (<i>Slco2b1</i><sup>flox/DTR</sup>), we found that the absence of Lyve1<sup>hi</sup>MHCII<sup>lo</sup> IMs exacerbated experimental lung fibrosis. Thus, we demonstrate that two independent populations of IMs coexist across tissues and exhibit conserved niche-dependent functional programming.</p>

Domain-focused CRISPR screen identifies HRI as a fetal hemoglobin regulator in human erythroid cells
<p>Increasing fetal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> (HbF) levels in adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blood cel</span></strong></span></strong>ls provides clinical benefit to patients with sickle cell disease and some forms of β-thalassemia. To identify potentially druggable HbF regulators in adult human erythroid cells, we employed a protein kinase domain–focused CRISPR-Cas9–based genetic screen with a newly optimized single-guide RNA scaffold. The screen uncovered the heme-regulated inhibitor HRI (also known as EIF2AK1), an erythroid-specific kinase that controls protein translation, as an HbF repressor. HRI depletion markedly increased HbF production in a specific manner and reduced sickling in cultured erythroid cells. Diminished expression of the HbF repressor BCL11A accounted in large part for the effects of HRI depletion. Taken together, these results suggest HRI as a potential therapeutic target for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong>opathies.</p>

Hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier dysfunction and risk for enteric infection
<p>Obesity, diabetes, and related manifestations are associated with an enhanced, but poorly understood, risk for mucosal infection and systemic inflammation. Here, we show in mouse models of obesity and diabetes that hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier permeability, through GLUT2-dependent transcriptional reprogramming of intestinal epithelial cells and alteration of tight and adherence junction integrity. Consequently, hyperglycemia-mediated barrier disruption leads to systemic influx of microbial products and enhanced dissemination of enteric infection. Treatment of hyperglycemia, intestinal epithelial–specific GLUT2 deletion, or inhibition of glucose metabolism restores barrier function and bacterial containment. In humans, systemic influx of intestinal microbiome products correlates with individualized glycemic control, indicated by glycated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> levels. Together, our results mechanistically link hyperglycemia and intestinal barrier function with systemic infectious and inflammatory consequences of obesity and diabetes.</p>

Gut bacteria selectively promoted by dietary fibers alleviate type 2 diabetes
<p>The gut microbiota benefits humans via short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production from carbohydrate fermentation, and deficiency in SCFA production is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We conducted a randomized clinical study of specifically designed isoenergetic diets, together with fecal shotgun metagenomics, to show that a select group of SCFA-producing strains was promoted by dietary fibers and that most other potential producers were either diminished or unchanged in patients with T2DM. When the fiber-promoted SCFA producers were present in greater diversity and abundance, participants had better improvement in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> A1c levels, partly via increased glucagon-like peptide-1 production. Promotion of these positive responders diminished producers of metabolically detrimental compounds such as indole and hydrogen sulfide. Targeted restoration of these SCFA producers may present a novel ecological approach for managing T2DM.</p>

Patient HLA class I genotype influences cancer response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy
<p>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–dependent killing of cancer cells requires efficient presentation of tumor antigens by human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>e antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules. However, the extent to which patient-specific HLA-I genotype influences response to anti–programmed cell death protein 1 or anti–cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 is currently unknown. We determined the HLA-I genotype of 1535 advanced cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Maximal heterozygosity at HLA-I loci (“A,” “B,” and “C”) improved overall survival after ICB compared with patients who were homozygous for at least one HLA locus. In two independent melanoma cohorts, patients with the HLA-B44 supertype had extended survival, whereas the HLA-B62 supertype (including HLA-B*15:01) or somatic loss of heterozygosity at HLA-I was associated with poor outcome. Molecular dynamics simulations of HLA-B*15:01 revealed different elements that may impair CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recognition of neoantigens. Our results have important implications for predicting response to ICB and for the design of neoantigen-based therapeutic vaccines.</p>

Elevated <i>HLA-A</i> expression impairs HIV control through inhibition of NKG2A-expressing cells
<p>The highly polymorphic human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>e antigen (<i>HLA</i>) locus encodes cell surface proteins that are critical for immunity. <i>HLA-A</i> expression levels vary in an allele-dependent manner, diversifying allele-specific effects beyond peptide-binding preference. Analysis of 9763 HIV-infected individuals from 21 cohorts shows that higher <i>HLA-A</i> levels confer poorer control of HIV. Elevated <i>HLA-A</i> expression provides enhanced levels of an HLA-A–derived signal peptide that specifically binds and determines expression levels of HLA-E, the ligand for the inhibitory NKG2A natural killer (NK) cell receptor. <i>HLA-B</i> haplotypes that favor NKG2A-mediated NK cell licensing (i.e., education) exacerbate the deleterious effect of high <i>HLA-A</i> on HIV control, consistent with NKG2A-mediated inhibition impairing NK cell clearance of HIV-infected targets. Therapeutic blockade of HLA-E:NKG2A interaction may yield benefit in HIV disease.</p>

Visualizing the function and fate of neutrophils in sterile injury and repair
<p>Neutrophils have been implicated as harmful cells in a variety of inappropriate inflammatory conditions where they injure the host, leading to the death of the neutrophils and their subsequent phagocytosis by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es and macrophages. Here we show that in a fully repairing sterile thermal hepatic injury, neutrophils also penetrate the injury site and perform the critical tasks of dismantling injured vessels and creating channels for new vascular regrowth. Upon completion of these tasks, they neither die at the injury site nor are phagocytosed. Instead, many of these neutrophils reenter the vasculature and have a preprogrammed journey that entails a sojourn in the lungs to up-regulate CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4) before entering the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong>, where they undergo apoptosis.</p>

UBE2O is a quality control factor for orphans of multiprotein complexes
<p>Many nascent proteins are assembled into multiprotein complexes of defined stoichiometry. Imbalances in the synthesis of individual subunits result in orphans. How orphans are selectively eliminated to maintain protein homeostasis is poorly understood. Here, we found that the conserved ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2O directly recognized juxtaposed basic and hydrophobic patches on unassembled proteins to mediate ubiquitination without a separate ubiquitin ligase. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reticulocyt</span></strong>es, where UBE2O is highly up-regulated, unassembled α-globin molecules that failed to assemble with β-globin were selectively ubiquitinated by UBE2O. In non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reticulocyt</span></strong>es, ribosomal proteins that did not engage nuclear import factors were targets for UBE2O. Thus, UBE2O is a self-contained quality control factor that comprises substrate recognition and ubiquitin transfer activities within a single protein to efficiently target orphans of multiprotein complexes for degradation.</p>

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals
<p>Multiple human diseases ensue from a hereditary or acquired deficiency of iron-transporting protein function that diminishes transmembrane iron flux in distinct sites and directions. Because other iron-transport proteins remain active, labile iron gradients build up across the corresponding protein-deficient membranes. Here we report that a small-molecule natural product, hinokitiol, can harness such gradients to restore iron transport into, within, and/or out of cells. The same compound promotes gut iron absorption in DMT1-deficient rats and ferroportin-deficient mice, as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong>ization in DMT1- and mitoferrin-deficient zebrafish. These findings illuminate a general mechanistic framework for small molecule–mediated site- and direction-selective restoration of iron transport. They also suggest that small molecules that partially mimic the function of missing protein transporters of iron, and possibly other ions, may have potential in treating human diseases.</p>

A large fraction of HLA class I ligands are proteasome-generated spliced peptides
<p>The proteasome generates the epitopes presented on human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>e antigen (HLA) class I molecules that elicit CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. Reports of proteasome-generated spliced epitopes exist, but they have been regarded as rare events. Here, however, we show that the proteasome-generated spliced peptide pool accounts for one-third of the entire HLA class I immunopeptidome in terms of diversity and one-fourth in terms of abundance. This pool also represents a unique set of antigens, possessing particular and distinguishing features. We validated this observation using a range of complementary experimental and bioinformatics approaches, as well as multiple cell types. The widespread appearance and abundance of proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing events has implications for immunobiology and autoimmunity theories and may provide a previously untapped source of epitopes for use in vaccines and cancer immunotherapy.</p>

The cellular and molecular origin of tumor-associated macrophages
<p>Long recognized as an evolutionarily ancient cell type involved in tissue homeostasis and immune defense against pathogens, macrophages are being rediscovered as regulators of several diseases, including cancer. Here we show that in mice, mammary tumor growth induces the accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that are phenotypically and functionally distinct from mammary tissue macrophages (MTMs). TAMs express the adhesion molecule Vcam1 and proliferate upon their differentiation from inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es, but do not exhibit an “alternatively activated” phenotype. TAM terminal differentiation depends on the transcriptional regulator of Notch signaling, RBPJ; and TAM, but not MTM, depletion restores tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T cell responses and suppresses tumor growth. These findings reveal the ontogeny of TAMs and a discrete tumor-elicited inflammatory response, which may provide new opportunities for cancer immunotherapy.</p>

Influence of HLA-C Expression Level on HIV Control
<sec><title>Thwarting HIV</title><p>Multiple genome-wide association studies have revealed that human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukocyt</span></strong>e antigen (HLA) genes of the major histocompatibility complex locus have the strongest impact on HIV. In particular, a single-nucleotide polymorphism 35 base pairs upstream of HLA-C shows significant association with viral load and protection against HIV. How HLA-C mediates these effects is unknown. <bold>Apps <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 87) now demonstrate that increasing surface expression of HLA-C is associated with reduced viral load and reduced rate of progression to low CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts in African and European Americans. High HLA-C expression likely promoted improved HIV control through a more effective cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response. In contrast to HIV infection, high HLA-C expression was associated with a higher risk of the inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease.</p></sec>

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be water permeable, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hematocrit</span></strong> and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>−</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated water loss by reducing urine output, which led to a reduction (by 29–76%) in ammonia excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent reduction (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of water to flush the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea synthesis occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea synthesis occurred without the accumulation of ammonia and total free amino acids, it can be deduced that ammonia production through amino acid catabolism was suppressed with a proportional reduction in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in ammonia production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in water, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a reduction in ammonia production, instead of increased urea synthesis, as the major strategy to ameliorate ammonia toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure.</p>

Pericardial Adipose Tissue Regulates Granulopoiesis, Fibrosis, and Cardiac Function After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The pericardial adipose tissue (AT) contains a high density of lymphoid clusters. It is unknown whether these clusters play a role in post–myocardial infarction (MI) inflammatory responses and cardiac outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lymphoid clusters were examined in epicardial AT of humans with or without coronary artery disease. Murine pericardial lymphoid clusters were visualized in mice subjected to coronary artery ligation. To study the relevance of pericardial clusters during inflammatory responses after MI, we surgically removed the pericardial AT and performed B-cell depletion and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor blockade. Leukocytes in murine hearts, pericardial AT, spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> were quantified by flow cytometry. Cannabinoid receptor CB2 (CB2<sup>–/–</sup>) mice were used as a model for enhanced B-cell responses. The effect of impaired dendritic cell (DC) trafficking on pericardial AT inflammatory responses was tested in CCR7<sup>–/–</sup> mice subjected to MI. Cardiac fibrosis and ventricular function were assessed by histology and echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified larger B-cell clusters in epicardial AT of human patients with coronary artery disease in comparison with controls without coronary artery disease. Infarcted mice also had larger pericardial clusters and 3-fold upregulated numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor–producing B cells within pericardial AT, but not spleen or lymph nodes. This was associated with higher DC and T-cell counts in pericardial AT, which outnumbered DCs and T cells in lymph nodes. Analysis of DC maturation markers, tracking experiments with fluorescently labeled cells, and use of CCR7-deficient mice suggested that activated DCs migrate from infarcts into pericardial AT via CCR7. B-cell depletion or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor neutralization inhibited DC and T-cell expansion within pericardial AT, and translated into reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone marrow</span></strong> granulopoiesis and cardiac neutrophil infiltration 3 days after MI. The relevance of the pericardial AT in mediating all these effects was confirmed by removal of pericardial AT and ex vivo coculture with pericardial AT and granulocyte progenitors. Finally, enhanced fibrosis and worsened ejection fraction in CB2<sup>–/–</sup> mice were limited by pericardial AT removal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings unveil a new mechanism by which the pericardial AT coordinates immune cell activation, granulopoiesis, and outcome after MI.</p></sec>

Derivation and Validation of a Novel Right-Sided Heart Failure Model After Implantation of Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The aim of the study was to derive and validate a novel risk score for early right-sided heart failure (RHF) after left ventricular assist device implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The EUROMACS (European Registry for Patients with Mechanical Circulatory Support) was used to identify adult patients undergoing continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation with mainstream devices. Eligible patients (n=2988) were randomly divided into derivation (n=2000) and validation (n=988) cohorts. The primary outcome was early (<30 days) severe postoperative RHF, defined as receiving short- or long-term right-sided circulatory support, continuous inotropic support for ≥14 days, or nitric oxide ventilation for ≥48 hours. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit. Covariates found to be associated with RHF (exploratory univariate <i>P</i><0.10) were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model. A risk score was then generated using the relative magnitude of the exponential regression model coefficients of independent predictors at the last step after checking for collinearity, likelihood ratio test, c index, and clinical weight at each step.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A 9.5-point risk score incorporating 5 variables (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support class, use of multiple inotropes, severe right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography, ratio of right atrial/pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong>) was created. The mean scores in the derivation and validation cohorts were 2.7±1.9 and 2.6±2.0, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.32). RHF in the derivation cohort occurred in 433 patients (21.7%) after left ventricular assist device implantation and was associated with a lower 1-year (53% versus 71%; <i>P</i><0.001) and 2-year (45% versus 58%; <i>P</i><0.001) survival compared with patients without RHF. RHF risk ranged from 11% (low risk score 0–2) to 43.1% (high risk score >4; <i>P</i><0.0001). Median intensive care unit stay was 7 days (interquartile range, 4–15 days) versus 24 days (interquartile range, 14–38 days) in patients without versus with RHF, respectively (<i>P</i><0.001). The c index of the composite score was 0.70 in the derivation and 0.67 in the validation cohort. The EUROMACS-RHF risk score outperformed (<i>P</i><0.0001) previously published scores and known individual echocardiographic and hemodynamic markers of RHF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This novel EUROMACS-RHF risk score outperformed currently known risk scores and clinical predictors of early postoperative RHF. This novel score may be useful for tailored risk-based clinical assessment and management of patients with advanced HF evaluated for ventricular assist device therapy.</p></sec>

Aerosol-driven droplet concentrations dominate coverage and water of oceanic low-level clouds
<p>A lack of reliable estimates of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong>s over oceans has severely limited our ability to quantify their effects on cloud properties and extent of cooling by reflecting solar radiation—a key uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. We introduce a methodology for ascribing cloud properties to CCN and isolating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> effects from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">meteorolog</span></strong>ical effects. Its application showed that for a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">meteorolog</span></strong>y, CCN explains three-fourths of the variability in the radiative cooling effect of clouds, mainly through affecting shallow cloud cover and water path. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of cloud radiative forcing to CCN than previously reported, which means too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This suggests the existence of compensating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> warming effects yet to be discovered, possibly through deep clouds.</p>

Volatile chemical products emerging as largest petrochemical source of urban organic emissions
<p>A gap in emission inventories of urban volatile organic compound (VOC) sources, which contribute to regional ozone and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> burdens, has increased as transportation emissions in the United States and Europe have declined rapidly. A detailed mass balance demonstrates that the use of volatile chemical products (VCPs)—including pesticides, coatings, printing inks, adhesives, cleaning agents, and personal care products—now constitutes half of fossil fuel VOC emissions in industrialized cities. The high fraction of VCP emissions is consistent with observed urban outdoor and indoor air measurements. We show that human exposure to carbonaceous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong>s of fossil origin is transitioning away from transportation-related sources and toward VCPs. Existing U.S. regulations on VCPs emphasize mitigating ozone and air toxics, but they currently exempt many chemicals that lead to secondary organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong>s.</p>

Substantial convection and precipitation enhancements by ultrafine aerosol particles
<sec><title>Up with ultrafine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> particles</title><p>Ultrafine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> particles (smaller than 50 nanometers in diameter) have been thought to be too small to affect cloud formation. Fan <i>et al.</i> show that this is not the case. They studied the effect of urban pollution transported into the otherwise nearly pristine atmosphere of the Amazon. Condensational growth of water droplets around the tiny particles releases latent heat, thereby intensifying atmospheric convection. Thus, anthropogenic ultrafine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> particles may exert a more important influence on cloud formation processes than previously believed.</p><p><i>Science</i>, this issue p. www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/fiop::amf2014goamazon, which is available to the community.

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental questions remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. We built a global model of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> formation by using extensive laboratory measurements of rates of nucleation involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, ions, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulations and a comparison with atmospheric observations show that nearly all nucleation throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addition to sulfuric acid. A considerable fraction of nucleation involves ions, but the relatively weak dependence on ion concentrations indicates that for the processes studied, variations in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleation in the present-day atmosphere.</p>

Dominant effect of relative tropical Atlantic warming on major hurricane occurrence
<p>Here we explore factors potentially linked to the enhanced major hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean during 2017. Using a suite of high-resolution model experiments, we show that the increase in 2017 major hurricanes was not primarily caused by La Niña conditions in the Pacific Ocean but rather triggered mainly by pronounced warm sea surface conditions in the tropical North Atlantic. Further, we superimpose a similar pattern of North Atlantic surface warming on data for long-term increasing sea surface temperature (a product of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations and decreases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong>s) to show that this warming trend will likely lead to even higher numbers of major hurricanes in the future. The key factor controlling Atlantic major hurricane activity appears to be the degree to which the tropical Atlantic warms relative to the rest of the global ocean.</p>

Atmospheric new particle formation from sulfuric acid and amines in a Chinese megacity
<p>Atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) is an important global phenomenon that is nevertheless sensitive to ambient conditions. According to both observation and theoretical arguments, NPF usually requires a relatively high sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) concentration to promote the formation of new particles and a low preexisting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> loading to minimize the sink of new particles. We investigated NPF in Shanghai and were able to observe both precursor vapors (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and initial clusters at a molecular level in a megacity. High NPF rates were observed to coincide with several familiar markers suggestive of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>–dimethylamine (DMA)–water (H<sub>2</sub>O) nucleation, including sulfuric acid dimers and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-DMA clusters. In a cluster kinetics simulation, the observed concentration of sulfuric acid was high enough to explain the particle growth to ~3 nanometers under the very high condensation sink, whereas the subsequent higher growth rate beyond this size is believed to result from the added contribution of condensing organic species. These findings will help in understanding urban NPF and its air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate secondary particle formation in China.</p>

Atmospheric blocking as a traffic jam in the jet stream
<p>Atmospheric blocking due to anomalous, persistent meandering of the jet stream often causes weather extremes in the mid-latitudes. Despite the ubiquity of blocking, the onset mechanism is not well understood. Here we demonstrate a close analogy between blocking and traffic congestion on a highway by using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">meteorolog</span></strong>ical data and show that blocking and traffic congestion can be described by a common mathematical theory. The theory predicts that the jet stream has a capacity for the flux of wave activity (a measure of meandering), just as the highway has traffic capacity, and when the capacity is exceeded, blocking manifests as congestion. Stationary waves modulate the jet stream’s capacity for transient waves and localize block formation. Climate change likely affects blocking frequency by modifying the jet stream’s proximity to capacity.</p>

A human-driven decline in global burned area
<p>Fire is an essential Earth system process that alters ecosystem and atmospheric composition. Here we assessed long-term fire trends using multiple satellite data sets. We found that global burned area declined by 24.3 ± 8.8% over the past 18 years. The estimated decrease in burned area remained robust after adjusting for precipitation variability and was largest in savannas. Agricultural expansion and intensification were primary drivers of declining fire activity. Fewer and smaller fires reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> concentrations, modified vegetation structure, and increased the magnitude of the terrestrial carbon sink. Fire models were unable to reproduce the pattern and magnitude of observed declines, suggesting that they may overestimate fire emissions in future projections. Using economic and demographic variables, we developed a conceptual model for predicting fire in human-dominated landscapes.</p>

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p>Ice formation on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong> particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level. This is partly because the nature of active sites, local surface features where ice growth commences, is still unclear. Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) surface planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) surface, exposed at surface defects such as steps, cracks, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high ice nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar particles.</p>

More tornadoes in the most extreme U.S. tornado outbreaks
<p>Tornadoes and severe thunderstorms kill people and damage property every year. Estimated U.S. insured losses due to severe thunderstorms in the first half of 2016 were $8.5 billion (US). The largest U.S. effects of tornadoes result from tornado outbreaks, which are sequences of tornadoes that occur in close succession. Here, using extreme value analysis, we find that the frequency of U.S. outbreaks with many tornadoes is increasing and that it is increasing faster for more extreme outbreaks. We model this behavior by extreme value distributions with parameters that are linear functions of time or of some indicators of multidecadal climatic variability. Extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">meteorolog</span></strong>ical environments associated with severe thunderstorms show consistent upward trends, but the trends do not resemble those currently expected to result from global warming.</p>

Emergence and spread of a human-transmissible multidrug-resistant nontuberculous mycobacterium
<p>Lung infections with <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i>, a species of multidrug-resistant nontuberculous mycobacteria, are emerging as an important global threat to individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), in whom <i>M. abscessus</i> accelerates inflammatory lung damage, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Previously, <i>M. abscessus</i> was thought to be independently acquired by susceptible individuals from the environment. However, using whole-genome analysis of a global collection of clinical isolates, we show that the majority of <i>M. abscessus</i> infections are acquired through transmission, potentially via fomites and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerosol</span></strong>s, of recently emerged dominant circulating clones that have spread globally. We demonstrate that these clones are associated with worse clinical outcomes, show increased virulence in cell-based and mouse infection models, and thus represent an urgent international infection challenge.</p>

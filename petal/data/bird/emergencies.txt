Our looming lead problem
<p>On 25 April 2014, Flint Mayor Dayne Walling ceremoniously shut off a valve to the Detroit water supply and opened the flow of the Flint River into local homes and businesses. He marked the occasion by drinking from a glass filled with water from the new source. Eighteen months later, the water supply was switched back to Detroit. What occurred in between—the city's failure to control infrastructure corrosion, the deterioration of fresh water entering Flint residences, citizen complaints, government denials, elevated lead levels in children, and public outcry—would become the basis for a crisis that rose to national attention in 2015. <i>What the Eyes Don't See </i>by Mona Hanna-Attisha and <i>The Poisoned City </i>by Anna Clark are the first two books to document in detail this horrible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disast</span></strong>er.</p>

Supporting recovery from brain injury
<p>The beauty and intricacy of the human brain is unfortunately also mirrored by its vulnerability. Damage to the brain is typically permanent. Because cells of the adult brain, apart from rare exceptions, no longer divide, there is essentially no regrowth of damaged brain tissue. Acquired brain injury in the majority of cases occurs directly through traumatic events such as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accid</span></strong>ent involving a blow to the head or indirectly through interruption of the blood supply, namely a stroke. Brain injury is a major burden, with an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffering a traumatic brain injury and nearly 800,000 Americans suffering a stroke each year (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, current treatment options for such brain injuries are still limited and are focused on the first hours after the insult. On page 50 of this issue, Abe <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a new approach in mouse and primate models that aims to enhance the ability of the brain to regain functionality in the days and weeks after brain injury.</p>

The spread of true and false news online
<p>We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disast</span></strong>ers, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.</p>

Circular RNAs hint at new realm of genetics
<p>For decades, loops of genetic material known as circular RNA were considered a kind of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accid</span></strong>ent. But scientists have given them new attention in recent years, and a set of papers published this month suggests some of them actually give rise to proteins, just like their more familiar, linear counterparts, messenger RNA. The new research reveals that, despite their unusual structure, circular RNAs can communicate with ribosomes, the cell’s proteinmaking machinery. And several proteins in fly, mouse, and human cells appear to be translated from circular RNAs. Researchers haven’t yet shown that these new proteins have an important function, many suspect they are a previously unrecognized way that cells control gene expression.</p>

Plastid Translation Elongation Factor Tu Is Prone to Heat-Induced Aggregation Despite Its Critical Role in Plant Heat Tolerance
<p>Translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is a conserved GTP-binding protein essential for protein translation in prokaryotes and in eukaryotic mitochondria and plastids. EF-Tu also has a GTP/GDP-independent chaperone activity that may function in acclimation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plastid EF-Tu, Rabe1b, rapidly becomes insoluble at temperatures as low as 35°C in vitro and 41°C in vivo, with more than 90% aggregation after 9 h at 45°C in vivo. Based on its established function in protein translation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced aggregation likely inactivates Rabe1b. To determine the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced aggregation, we isolated an Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> knockdown mutant and discovered it to be highly compromised in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. Overexpression of constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant forms of Rabe1b in Arabidopsis and virus-induced silencing of <i>Rabe1b</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) also reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. Compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance in the Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant and in the lines overexpressing constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant Rabe1b proteins was associated with reduced plastid translation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. The Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant also showed compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced expression of <i>HsfA2</i> and its target genes. Constitutive overexpression of HsfA2 activated its target genes but only partially restored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance of the <i>rabe1b</i> mutant. These results strongly suggest that the plastid protein EF-Tu is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> sensitive and acts as a critical limiting factor in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress responses, primarily functioning in plastid protein translation but also in protein folding and retrograde signaling of nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-responsive gene expression.</p>

STABILIZED1 Modulates Pre-mRNA Splicing for Thermotolerance
<p>High-temperature stress often leads to differential RNA splicing, thus accumulating different types and/or amounts of mature mRNAs in eukaryotic cells. However, regulatory mechanisms underlying plant precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing in the environmental stress conditions remain elusive. Herein, we describe that a U5-snRNP-interacting protein homolog STABILIZED1 (STA1) has pre-mRNA splicing activity for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-inducible transcripts including <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</i>s and various <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> SHOCK PROTEIN</i>s for the establishment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our cell-based splicing reporter assay demonstrated STA1 acts on pre-mRNA splicing for specific subsets of stress-related genes. Cellular reconstitution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-inducible transcription cascades supported the view that STA1-dependent pre-mRNA splicing plays a role in DREB2A-dependent <i>HSFA3</i> expression for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-responsive gene expression. Further genetic analysis with a loss-of-function mutant <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in Col background, and <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background verified that STA1 is essential in expression of necessary genes including <i>HSFA3</i> for two-step <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress tolerance in plants. However, constitutive overexpression of the cDNA version of <i>HSFA3</i> in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background is unable to execute plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress tolerance in <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>. Consistently our global target analysis of STA1 showed that its splicing activity modulates a rather broad range of gene expression in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> treatment. The findings of this study reveal that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-inducible STA1 activity for pre-mRNA splicing serves as a molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the plant stress tolerance to high-temperature stress.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In addition, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In addition, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG accumulation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in addition to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

Profiling the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force in B cell activation
<p>B lymphocytes use B cell receptors (BCRs) to recognize membrane-bound antigens to further initiate cell spreading and contraction responses during B cell activation. We combined traction force microscopy and live-cell imaging to profile the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion in these responses. We showed that B cell activation required the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of 10 to 20 nN of traction force when encountering antigens presented by substrates with stiffness values from 0.5 to 1 kPa, which mimic the rigidity of antigen-presenting cells in vivo. Perturbation experiments revealed that F-actin remodeling and myosin- and dynein-mediated contractility contributed to traction force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion and B cell activation. Moreover, membrane-proximal BCR signaling molecules (including Lyn, Syk, Btk, PLC-γ2, BLNK, and Vav3) and adaptor molecules (Grb2, Cbl, and Dok-3) linking BCR microclusters and motor proteins were also required for the sustained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of these traction forces. We found a positive correlation between the strength of the traction force and the mean fluorescence intensity of the BCR microclusters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that isotype-switched memory B cells expressing immunoglobulin G (IgG)–BCRs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed greater traction forces than did mature naive B cells expressing IgM-BCRs during B cell activation. Last, we observed that primary B cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed greater traction forces than did B cells from healthy donors in response to antigen stimulation. Together, these data delineate the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force during B cell activation.</p>

Bioorthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) Enables Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein Synthesis in Native Plant Tissue
<p>Proteomic plasticity undergirds stress responses in plants, and understanding such responses requires accurate measurement of the extent to which proteins levels are adjusted to counter external stimuli. Here, we adapt bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to interrogate protein synthesis in vegetative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. BONCAT relies on the translational incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid probe into cellular proteins. In this study, the probe is the Met surrogate azidohomoalanine (Aha), which carries a reactive azide moiety in its amino acid side chain. The azide handle in Aha can be selectively conjugated to dyes and functionalized beads to enable visualization and enrichment of newly synthesized proteins. We show that BONCAT is sensitive enough to detect Arabidopsis proteins synthesized within a 30-min interval defined by an Aha pulse and that the method can be used to detect proteins made under conditions of light stress, osmotic shock, salt stress, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, and recovery from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. We further establish that BONCAT can be coupled to tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins synthesized during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress and recovery from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Our results are consistent with a model in which, upon the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, translation is rapidly reprogrammed to enhance the synthesis of stress mitigators and is again altered during recovery. All experiments were carried out with commercially available reagents, highlighting the accessibility of the BONCAT method to researchers interested in stress responses as well as translational and posttranslational regulation in plants.</p>

Evolutionary capacity of upper thermal limits: beyond single trait assessments
<p>Thermal tolerance is an important factor influencing the distribution of ectotherms, but we still have limited understanding of the ability of species to evolve different thermal limits. Recent studies suggest that species may have limited capacity to evolve higher thermal limits in response to slower, more ecologically relevant rates of warming. However, these conclusions are based on univariate estimates of adaptive capacity. To test these findings within an explicitly multivariate context, we used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to estimate the multivariate evolutionary potential for upper thermal limits in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We assessed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance using static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero only for the static measures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. Our <bold>G</bold> matrix analysis revealed that any response to selection for increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance will largely be driven by static basal and hardened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance, with minimal contribution from ramping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. These results suggest that the capacity to evolve upper thermal limits in nature may depend on the type of thermal stress experienced.</p>

A coupled-clock system drives the automaticity of human sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells
<p>The spontaneous rhythmic action potentials <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker in the heart, dictate the regular and optimal cardiac contractions that pump blood around the body. Although the heart rate of humans is substantially slower than that of smaller experimental animals, current perspectives on the biophysical mechanisms underlying the automaticity of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells (SANCs) have been gleaned largely from studies of animal hearts. Using human SANCs, we demonstrated that spontaneous rhythmic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> clock were coupled to electrogenic surface membrane molecules (the M clock) to trigger rhythmic action potentials, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup>–cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling regulated clock coupling. When these clocks became uncoupled, SANCs failed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e spontaneous action potentials, showing a depolarized membrane potential and disorganized local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases that failed to activate the M clock. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, which increases cAMP concentrations and clock coupling in other species, restored spontaneous, rhythmic action potentials in some nonbeating “arrested” human SANCs by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and synchronizing diastolic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases. When β-AR stimulation was withdrawn, the clocks again became uncoupled, and SANCs reverted to a nonbeating arrested state. Thus, automaticity of human pacemaker cells is driven by a coupled-clock system driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling. Extreme clock uncoupling led to failure of spontaneous action potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion, which was restored by recoupling of the clocks. Clock coupling and action potential firing in some of these arrested cells can be restored by β-AR stimulation–induced augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling.</p>

Splenic leukocytes define the resolution of inflammation in heart failure
<p>Inflammation promotes healing in myocardial infarction but, if unresolved, leads to heart failure. To define the inflammatory and resolving responses, we quantified leukocyte trafficking and specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) in the infarcted left ventricle and spleen after myocardial infarction, with the goal of distinguishing inflammation from its resolution. Our data suggest that the spleen not only served as a leukocyte reservoir but also was the site where SPMs were actively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed after coronary ligation in mice. Before myocardial infarction, SPMs were more abundant in the spleen than in the left ventricle. At day 1 after coronary ligation, the spleen was depleted of leukocytes, a phenomenon that was associated with greater numbers of leukocytes in the infarcted left ventricle and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of SPMs at the same site, particularly resolvins, maresin, lipoxins, and protectin. In addition, the infarcted left ventricle showed increased expression of genes encoding lipoxygenases and enhanced production of SPMs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by these enzymes. We found that macrophages were necessary for SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. The abundance of SPMs in the spleen before myocardial infarction and increased SPM concentrations in the infarcted left ventricle within 24 hours after myocardial infarction were temporally correlated with the resolution of inflammation. Thus, the acute inflammatory response coincided with the active resolving phase in post–myocardial infarction and suggests that further investigation into macrophage-derived SPMs in heart failure is warranted.</p>

Electrified methane reforming: A compact approach to greener industrial hydrogen production
<p>Electrification of conventionally fired chemical reactors has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and provide flexible and compact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>ed catalytic structure directly into a steam-methane–reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production. Intimate contact between the electric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases catalyst utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated design with small characteristic length scales allows compact reactor designs, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer platforms. Electrification of SMR offers a strong platform for new reactor design, scale, and implementation opportunities. Implemented on a global scale, this could correspond to a reduction of nearly 1% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

Mechanisms of reef coral resistance to future climate change

To determine the mechanisms of temperature tolerance, we reciprocally transplanted corals between reef sites experiencing distinct temperature regimes and tested subsequent physiological and gene expression profiles. Local acclimatization and fixed effects, such as adaptation, contributed about equally to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance and are reflected in patterns of gene expression. In less than 2 years, acclimatization achieves the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance that we would expect from strong natural selection over many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ions for these long-lived organisms. Our results show both short-term acclimatory and longer-term adaptive acquisition of climate resistance. Adding these adaptive abilities to ecosystem models is likely to slow predictions of demise for coral reef ecosystems.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Capacity of Mitochondria in Microsporophylls May Function in Cycad Thermogenesis
<p>Cone thermogenesis is a widespread phenomenon in cycads and may function to promote volatile emissions that affect pollinator behavior. Given their large population size and intense and durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-producing effects, cycads are important organisms for comprehensive studies of plant thermogenesis. However, knowledge of mitochondrial morphology and function in cone thermogenesis is limited. Therefore, we investigated these mitochondrial properties in the thermogenic cycad species <i>Cycas revoluta</i>. Male cones <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> even in cool weather conditions. Female cones produced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>, but to a lesser extent than male cones. Ultrastructural analyses of the two major tissues of male cones, microsporophylls and microsporangia, revealed the existence of a population of mitochondria with a distinct morphology in the microsporophylls. In these cells, we observed large mitochondria (cross-sectional area of 2 μm<sup>2</sup> or more) with a uniform matrix density that occupied >10% of the total mitochondrial volume. Despite the size difference, many nonlarge mitochondria (cross-sectional area <2 μm<sup>2</sup>) also exhibited a shape and a matrix density similar to those of large mitochondria. Alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and expression levels in microsporophylls were much higher than those in microsporangia. The <i>AOX</i> genes expressed in male cones revealed two different <i>AOX</i> complementary DNA sequences: <i>CrAOX1</i> and <i>CrAOX2</i>. The expression level of <i>CrAOX1</i> mRNA in the microsporophylls was 100 times greater than that of <i>CrAOX2</i> mRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that distinctive mitochondrial morphology and CrAOX1-mediated respiration in microsporophylls might play a role in cycad cone thermogenesis.</p>

Glucose-Regulated <i>HLP1</i> Acts as a Key Molecule in Governing Thermomemory
<p>Induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> shock proteins (HSPs) in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress (HS) is indispensable for conferring thermotolerance. Glc, a fundamental signaling and metabolic molecule, provides energy to stressed seedlings to combat stress. The recovery of stressed plants from detrimental HS in response to Glc is largely mediated by HSPs, but the mechanistic basis of this thermotolerance is not well defined. In this study, we show that Glc has a prominent role in providing thermotolerance. Glc-mediated thermotolerance involves HSP induction via the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR)-E2Fa signaling module. Apart from HSPs, TOR-E2Fa also regulates the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ortholog of human <i>Hikeshi</i>, named <i>HIKESHI</i>-<i>LIKE PROTEIN1</i> (<i>HLP1</i>). Expression of <i>proHLP1</i>::<i>GUS</i> in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) after HS coincides with TOR-E2Fa expression, substantiating a role for TOR-E2Fa-HLP1 in providing thermotolerance. We also demonstrate that Glc along with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> could induce proliferation activity in the SAM after HS recovery, which was arrested by the TOR inhibitor AZD-8055. Molecular and physiological studies suggest that HS-activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress transcription factor A1s also positively regulate <i>HLP1</i> transcription, suggesting convergence of the Glc and HS signaling pathways. Loss of functional HLP1 causes HS hypersensitivity, whereas HLP1 overexpressors display increased thermotolerance. HLP1 binds to the promoters of Glc-regulated HS-responsive genes and promotes chromatin acetylation. In addition, Glc modifies the chromatin landscape at thermomemory-related loci by promoting H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Glc-primed accumulation of H3K4me3 at thermomemory-associated loci is mediated through HLP1. These findings reveal the novel function of Glc-regulated <i>HLP1</i> in mediating thermotolerance/thermomemory response.</p>

Visualizing Embolism Propagation in Gas-Injected Leaves

We report a method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e leaf xylem vulnerability curves (VCs) by gas injection. Using optical light transmission, we visualized embolism propagation in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves injected with positive gas pressure. This resulted in a rapid, stepwise reduction of transmitted light, identical to that observed during leaf dehydration, confirming that the optical method detects gas bubbles and provides insights into the air-seeding hypothesis. In red oak, xylem VCs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed using gas injection were similar to those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed using bench dehydration, but indicated 50% loss of conductivity at lower tension (∼0.4 MPa) in grapevine. In determining VC, this method eliminates the need to ascertain xylem tension, thus avoiding potential errors in water potential estimations. It is also much faster (1 h per VC). However, severing the petiole and applying high-pressure gas could affect air-seeding and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed VC. We discuss potential artifacts arising from gas injection and recommend comparison of this method with a more standard procedure before it is assumed to be suitable for a given species.</p>

Consensus Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Key Regulators of Flower and Fruit Development in Wild Strawberry
<p>The diploid strawberry, <i>Fragaria vesca</i>, is a developing model system for the economically important Rosaceae family.

To investigate strawberry fruit development, we previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed spatial and temporal transcriptome data profiling <i>F. vesca</i> flower and fruit development pre- and postfertilization. In this study, we combined 46 of our existing RNA-seq libraries to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e coexpression networks using the Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis package in R. We then applied a post-hoc consensus clustering approach and used bootstrapping to demonstrate consensus clustering’s ability to produce robust and reproducible clusters. Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the networks, including increased iron transport from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene. To increase their utility, the networks are presented in a web interface (<ext-link>www.fv.rosaceaefruits.org</ext-link>) for easy exploration and identification of coexpressed genes.

The Arabidopsis DNA Methylome Is Stable under Transgenerational Drought Stress
<p>Improving the responsiveness, acclimation, and memory of plants to abiotic stress holds substantive potential for improving agriculture. An unresolved question is the involvement of chromatin marks in the memory of agriculturally relevant stresses. Such potential has spurred numerous investigations yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust stress-induced DNA methylation variation can underpin stress memory. Using a slow-onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we investigated the malleability of the DNA methylome to drought stress within a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion and under repeated drought stress over five successive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ions. While drought-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected within a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion, they did not correlate with drought-responsive gene expression. Six traits were analyzed for trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ional stress memory, and the descendants of drought-stressed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion removed from stress. With respect to trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ional drought stress, there were negligible conserved differentially methylated regions in drought-exposed lineages compared with unstressed lineages. Instead, the majority of observed variation was tied to stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the experience of repeated drought stress was not observed to influence trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ional epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that, while trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ional memory is observed in one of six traits examined, they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to drought stress.</p>

The Pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 Sustains Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis as a Function of Heat Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants sense temperature changes and respond by altering growth and metabolic activity to acclimate to the altered environmental conditions. The B vitamins give rise to vital coenzymes that are indispensable for growth and development but their inherent reactive nature renders them prone to destruction especially under stress conditions. Therefore, plant survival strategies would be expected to include mechanisms to sustain B vitamin supply under demanding circumstances. Here, using the example of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, we investigate the regulation of biosynthesis across eudicot and monocot species under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Most eudicots carry a pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 that is a noncatalytic homolog of the PDX1 subunit of the vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis protein machinery, PYRIDOXINE BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN1. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) as models, we show that <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> is transcriptionally regulated by the HSFA1 transcription factor family. Monocots only carry catalytic <i>PDX1</i> homologs that do not respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress as demonstrated for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis across the two lineages. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> transcription reveals two alternative transcriptional start sites, one of which is exclusive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Further data suggest that PDX1.2 leads to stabilization of the catalytic PDX1s under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress conditions, which would serve to maintain vitamin B<sub>6</sub> homeostasis in times of need in eudicots that carry this gene. Our analyses indicate an important abiotic stress tolerance strategy in several eudicots, which has not been evolutionarily adapted (or is not required) by monocots such as grasses.</p>

Integrating Omics and Alternative Splicing Reveals Insights into Grape Response to High Temperature
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress is one of the primary abiotic stresses that limit crop production. Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a cultivated fruit with high economic value throughout the world, with its growth and development often influenced by high temperature. Alternative splicing (AS) is a widespread phenomenon increasing transcriptome and proteome diversity. We conducted high-temperature treatments (35°C, 40°C, and 45°C) on grapevines and assessed transcriptomic (especially AS) and proteomic changes in leaves. We found that nearly 70% of the genes were alternatively spliced under high temperature. Intron retention (IR), exon skipping, and alternative donor/acceptor sites were markedly induced under different high temperatures. Among all differential AS events, IR was the most abundant up- and down-regulated event. Moreover, the occurrence frequency of IR events at 40°C and 45°C was far higher than at 35°C. These results indicated that AS, especially IR, is an important posttranscriptional regulatory event during grape leaf responses to high temperature. Proteomic analysis showed that protein levels of the RNA-binding proteins SR45, SR30, and SR34 and the nuclear ribonucleic protein U1A gradually rose as ambient temperature increased, which revealed a reason why AS events occurred more frequently under high temperature. After integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> shock proteins and some important transcription factors such as MULTIPROTEIN BRIDGING FACTOR1c and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A2 were involved mainly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance in grape through up-regulating transcriptional (especially modulated by AS) and translational levels. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for grape leaf responses to high temperature at simultaneous transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels.</p>

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral suppressors of RNA silencing induce developmental defects similar to those caused by mutations in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral suppressor-mediated developmental defects to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental defects in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral suppressors were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> mutation. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral suppressor-mediated developmental defects, using two independent <i>arf8</i> mutations and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral suppressor of silencing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the phenotype in the F2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. However, the loss of phenotype in the F2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent loss-of-function point mutation, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ions. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental defects caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

Cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness is associated with diapause, but not the non-diapause developmental pathway, in the blow fly <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Predicting insect responses to global climate change involves understanding cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion effects of temperature. The majority of temperate insects overwinter in a state of diapause, a pre-emptive response to winter conditions associated with increased cold hardiness. Diapause is often induced following maternal adult detection of an environmental cue signifying the onset of winter, whilst diapause is initiated in a subsequent life stage and/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. Continued global warming will expose adults to higher late-autumn temperatures, whilst diapause life stages will still experience prolonged winter cold. The cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion effect of temperature was investigated by acclimating adult <i>Calliphora vicina</i> to present-day (15°C) and future (20°C) late-autumn conditions and assessing cold-hardiness in diapause (D15 and D20) and non-diapause (ND15 and ND20) progeny. A cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion plasticity in cold hardiness was associated with D but not ND larvae. D15 larvae exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress internal freezing (supercooling point=−18.9±0.9°C) compared with D20 (−15.3±0.8°C), and displayed a greater tolerance of prolonged exposure to −4°C (LT<sub>50</sub>=26.0±1.0 and 11.4±1.1 days, respectively) and −8°C (5.1±1.1 and 3.0±1.1 days, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduced glucose content in D15 (2.4±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) compared with D20 (3.0±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) larvae. In conclusion, <i>C. vicina</i> adults exposed to warmer autumn conditions during diapause induction will produce larvae with a reduced cold hardiness capacity, which could negatively impact winter survival. Given that maternal regulation of diapause is common among temperate insects, this could be a widespread phenomenon.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>es fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>es a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ing water motion by mouth suction.</p>

Networks of enzymatically oxidized membrane lipids support calcium-dependent coagulation factor binding to maintain hemostasis
<p>Blood coagulation functions as part of the innate immune system by preventing bacterial invasion, and it is critical to stopping blood loss (hemostasis). Coagulation involves the external membrane surface of activated platelets and leukocytes. Using lipidomic, genetic, biochemical, and mathematical modeling approaches, we found that enzymatically oxidized phospholipids (eoxPLs) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by the activity of leukocyte or platelet lipoxygenases (LOXs) were required for normal hemostasis and promoted coagulation factor activities in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phosphatidylserine (PS)–dependent manner. In wild-type mice, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid–phospholipids (HETE-PLs) enhanced coagulation and restored normal hemostasis in clotting-deficient animals genetically lacking p12-LOX or 12/15-LOX activity. Murine platelets <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed 22 eoxPL species, all of which were missing in the absence of p12-LOX. Humans with the thrombotic disorder antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) had statistically significantly increased HETE-PLs in platelets and leukocytes, as well as greater HETE-PL immunoreactivity, than healthy controls. HETE-PLs enhanced membrane binding of the serum protein β2GP1 (β2-glycoprotein 1), an event considered central to the autoimmune reactivity responsible for APS symptoms. Correlation network analysis of 47 platelet eoxPL species in platelets from APS and control subjects identified their enzymatic origin and revealed a complex network of regulation, with the abundance of 31 p12-LOX–derived eoxPL molecules substantially increased in APS. In summary, circulating blood cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e networks of eoxPL molecules, including HETE-PLs, which change membrane properties to enhance blood coagulation and contribute to the excessive clotting and immunoreactivity of patients with APS.</p>

The thermal conductivity of BAs, 1000 ± 90 watts per meter per kelvin meter-kelvin, is higher than that of silicon carbide by a factor of 3 and is surpassed only by diamond and the basal-plane value of graphite. This work shows that BAs represents a class of ultrahigh–thermal conductivity materials predicted by a recent theory, and that it may constitute a useful thermal management material for high–power density electronic devices.</p>

Metabolome Analysis of Multi-Connected Biparental Chromosome Segment Substitution Line Populations

Here, the flag leaves from three interconnected chromosome segment substitution line populations with a common recurrent genetic background were used to dissect rice metabolic diversity. We effectively used multiple interconnected biparental populations, constructed by introducing genomic segments into Zhenshan 97 from ACC10 (A/Z), Minghui 63 (M/Z), and Nipponbare (N/Z), to map metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTL). A total of 1,587 mQTL were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed, of which 684, 479, and 722 were obtained from the A/Z, M/Z, and N/Z chromosome segment substitution line populations, respectively, and we designated 99 candidate genes for 367 mQTL. In addition, 1,001 mQTL were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed specifically from joint linkage analysis with 25 candidate genes assigned. Several of these candidates were validated, such as <i>LOC_Os07g01020</i> for the in vivo content of pyridoxine and its derivative and <i>LOC_Os04g25980</i> for cis-zeatin glucosyltransferase activity. We propose a novel biosynthetic pathway for <i>O</i>-methylapigenin <i>C</i>-pentoside and demonstrated that <i>LOC_Os04g11970</i> encodes a component of this pathway through fine-mapping. We postulate that the methylated apigenin may confer plant disease resistance. This study demonstrates the power of using multiple interconnected populations to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e a large number of veritable mQTL. The combined results are discussed in the context of functional metabolomics and the possible features of assigned candidates underlying respective metabolites.</p>

Heat Shock Factor HsfA1a Is Essential for <i>R</i> Gene-Mediated Nematode Resistance and Triggers H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Production<sup>1</sup>
<p>Plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the apoplast in response to pathogen attack, especially following resistance (<i>R</i>) gene-mediated pathogen recognition; however, the mechanisms activating ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that RKN (<i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>) infection rapidly induces ROS accumulation in the roots of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants that contain the <i>R</i> gene <i>Mi-1.2</i> but rarely induces ROS accumulation in the susceptible or <i>Mi-1.2</i>-silenced resistant genotypes. RNK also induces the hypersensitive response, a form of programmed cell death, in <i>Mi-1.2</i> plants. RKN induces the expression of numerous class-A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> shock factor (HsfA) genes in resistant tomato plants. Silencing <i>HsfA1a</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated resistance, apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, and the transcription of <i>whitefly induced 1</i> (<i>Wfi1</i>), which encodes a respiratory burst oxidase homolog. HsfA1a regulates <i>Wfi1</i> transcription by binding to the <i>Wfi1</i> promoter, and silencing of <i>Wfi1</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated resistance. HsfA1a and Wfi1 are involved in Mi-1.2-triggered Hsp90 accumulation and basal defense in susceptible tomato. Thus, HsfA–1aWfi1-dependent ROS signaling functions as a crucial regulator of plant defense responses.</p>

Etiolated Stem Branching Is a Result of Systemic Signaling Associated with Sucrose Level
<p>The potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) tuber is a swollen stem. Sprouts growing from the tuber nodes represent loss of apical dominance and branching. Long cold storage induces loss of tuber apical dominance and results in secondary branching. Here, we show that a similar branching pattern can be induced by short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> treatment of the tubers. Detached sprouts were induced to branch by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> treatment only when attached to a parenchyma cylinder. Grafting experiments showed that the scion branches only when grafted onto <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>- or cold-treated tuber parenchyma, suggesting that the branching signal is transmitted systemically from the bud-base parenchyma to the grafted stem. Exogenous supply of sucrose (Suc), glucose, or fructose solution to detached sprouts induced branching in a dose-responsive manner, and an increase in Suc level was observed in tuber parenchyma upon branching induction, suggesting a role for elevated parenchyma sugars in the regulation of branching. However, sugar analysis of the apex and node after grafting showed no distinct differences in sugar levels between branching and nonbranching stems. Vacuolar invertase is a key enzyme in determining the level of Suc and its cleavage products, glucose and fructose, in potato parenchyma. Silencing of the vacuolar invertase-encoding gene led to increased tuber branching in combination with branching-inducing treatments. These results suggest that Suc in the parenchyma induces branching through signaling and not by excess mobilization from the parenchyma to the stem.</p>

Catastrophic Unbalanced Genome Rearrangements Cause Somatic Loss of Berry Color in Grapevine
<p>Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) color somatic variants that can be used to develop new grapevine cultivars occasionally appear associated with deletion events of uncertain origin. To understand the mutational mechanisms <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ing somatic structural variation in grapevine, we compared the Tempranillo Blanco (TB) white berry somatic variant with its black berry ancestor, Tempranillo Tinto. Whole-genome sequencing uncovered a catastrophic genome rearrangement in TB that caused the hemizygous deletion of 313 genes, including the loss of the functional copy for the <i>MYB</i> transcription factors required for anthocyanin pigmentation in the berry skin. Loss of heterozygosity and decreased copy number delimited interspersed monosomic and disomic regions in the right arm of linkage groups 2 and 5. At least 11 validated clustered breakpoints involving intrachromosomal and interchromosomal translocations between three linkage groups flanked the deleted fragments, which, according to segregation analyses, are phased in a single copy of each of the affected chromosomes. These hallmarks, along with the lack of homology between breakpoint joins and the randomness of the order and orientation of the rearranged fragments, are all consistent with a chromothripsis-like pattern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed after chromosome breakage and illegitimate rejoining. This unbalanced genome reshuffling has additional consequences in reproductive development. In TB, lack of sexual transmission of rearranged chromosomes associates with low gamete viability, which compromises fruit set and decreases fruit production. Our findings show that catastrophic genome rearrangements arise spontaneously and stabilize during plant somatic growth. These dramatic rearrangements <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e new interesting phenotypes that can be selected for the improvement of vegetatively propagated plant species.</p>

Quantifying Wheat Sensitivities to Environmental Constraints to Dissect Genotype × Environment Interactions in the Field
<p>Yield is subject to strong genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions in the field, especially under abiotic constraints such as soil water deficit (drought [D]) and high temperature (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> [H]). Since environmental conditions show strong fluctuations during the whole crop cycle, geneticists usually do not consider environmental measures as quantitative variables but rather as factors in multienvironment analyses. Based on 11 experiments in a field platform with contrasting temperature and soil water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to drought and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> constraints in w<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components. G × E interactions were separated into their underlying components, constitutive genotypic effect (G), G × D, G × H, and G × H × D, and were analyzed for two genotypes, highlighting contrasting responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> and drought constraints. We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviors of two strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated previously with yield components. This analysis confirmed the constitutive effect of the chromosome 1B QTL and explained the G × E interaction of the chromosome 3B QTL by a benefit of one allele when temperature rises. In addition to the method itself, which can be applied to other data sets and populations, this study will support the cloning of a major yield QTL on chromosome 3B that is highly dependent on environmental conditions and for which the climatic interaction is now quantified.</p>

CRISPR-Cas9 Targeted Mutagenesis Leads to Simultaneous Modification of Different Homoeologous Gene Copies in Polyploid Oilseed Rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>)
<p>In polyploid species, altering a trait by random mutagenesis is highly inefficient due to gene redundancy. We have stably transformed tetraploid oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) with a CRISPR-Cas9 construct targeting two <i>ALCATRAZ</i> (<i>ALC</i>) homoeologs. <i>ALC</i> is involved in valve margin development and, thus, contributes to seed shattering from mature fruits. Knocking out <i>ALC</i> would increase shatter resistance to avoid seed loss during mechanical harvest. We obtained a transgenic T1 plant with four <i>alc</i> mutant alleles by the use of a single target sequence. All mutations were stably inherited to the T2 progeny. The T2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion was devoid of any wild-type alleles, proving that the underlying T1 was a nonchimeric double heterozygote. T-DNA and <i>ALC</i> loci were not linked, as indicated by random segregation in the T2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. Hence, we could select double mutants lacking the T-DNA already in the first offspring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. However, whole-genome sequencing data revealed at least five independent insertions of vector backbone sequences. We did not detect any off-target effects in two genome regions homologous to the target sequence. The simultaneous alteration of multiple homoeologs by CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis without any background mutations will offer new opportunities for using mutant genotypes in rapeseed breeding.</p>

PECTIN METHYLESTERASE34 Contributes to Heat Tolerance through Its Role in Promoting Stomatal Movement
<p>Pectin, a major component of the primary cell wall, is synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and exported to the cell wall in a highly methylesterified form, then is partially demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; EC 3.1.1.11). PME activity on the status of pectin methylesterification profoundly affects the properties of pectin and, thereby, is critical for plant development and the plant defense response, although the roles of PMEs under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress (HS) are poorly understood. Functional genome annotation predicts that at least 66 potential <i>PME</i> genes are contained in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Thermotolerance assays of <i>PME</i> gene T-DNA insertion lines revealed two null mutant alleles of <i>PME34</i> (At3g49220) that both consistently showed reduced thermotolerance. Nevertheless, their impairment was independently associated with the expression of HS-responsive genes. It was also observed that <i>PME34</i> transcription was induced by abscisic acid and highly expressed in guard cells. We showed that the <i>PME34</i> mutation has a defect in the control of stomatal movement and greatly altered PME and polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15) activity, resulting in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-sensitive phenotype. <i>PME34</i> has a role in the regulation of transpiration through the control of the stomatal aperture due to its cell wall-modifying enzyme activity during the HS response. Hence, PME34 is required for regulating guard cell wall flexibility to mediate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> response in Arabidopsis.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease genetics, and conservation biology. To estimate mutation rates and evaluate the effect of selection on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ions and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

Lineage-Specific Transcriptional Profiles of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. Unaltered by Heat Stress in a Coral Host
<p>Dinoflagellates of the genus <i>Symbiodinium</i> form an endosymbiosis with reef building corals, in which photosynthetically derived nutrients comprise the majority of the coral energy budget. An extraordinary amount of functional and genetic diversity is contained within the coral-associated <i>Symbiodinium,</i> with some phylotypes (i.e., genotypic groupings), conferring enhanced stress tolerance to host corals. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have enabled transcriptome-wide profiling of the stress response of the cnidarian coral host; however, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular response to stress of coral-associated <i>Symbiodinium,</i> as well as differences among physiologically susceptible and tolerant types, remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine the transcriptome-wide response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress via RNA-Seq of two types of <i>Symbiodinium,</i> the putatively thermotolerant type D2 and the more susceptible type C3K, resident within the same coral host species, <i>Acropora hyacinthus</i>. Contrary to previous findings with coral hosts, we find no detectable change in gene expression across the dinoflagellate transcriptome after 3 days of elevated thermal exposure, despite physical evidence of symbiosis breakdown. However, hundreds of genes identified as orthologs between the C and D types exhibited significant expression differences within treatments (i.e., attributable solely to type, not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> exposure). These include many genes related to known thermotolerance mechanisms including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> shock proteins and chloroplast membrane components. Additionally, both the between-treatment similarities and between-type differences remained pervasive after 12–18 months of common garden acclimation and in mixed <i>Symbiodinium</i> assemblages within the same coral host colony.</p>

Trans-generational plasticity in physiological thermal tolerance is modulated by maternal pre-reproductive environment in the polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i>
<p>Maternal temperature is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its effect on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with temperature changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i> to investigate the influence of maternal temperature on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30°C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24°C and then exposed to 18 or 30°C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24°C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance whenever mother–offspring temperatures did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when temperatures persisted across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ions. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30°C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother–offspring environments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ional effect of temperature on physiological performance characterised by a high context dependency, and are discussed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences.</p>

Invasion and adaptation of a warm-adapted species to montane localities: effect of acclimation potential
<p><i>Drosophila ananassae</i> has successfully invaded the cold and dry montane localities of the Western Himalayas in recent years. The ability of this desiccation- and cold-sensitive tropical species to evolve in response to seasonal changes in montane localities is largely unknown. Here, we investigated how this sensitive species adapt to seasonally varying environmental conditions that are lethal to its survival. We observed change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i> in five mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000–2010). We document invasion of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities and increase in frequency of the dark morph. The stress tolerance of morphs (dark and light) remained unaffected of developmental acclimation. However, adult acclimation has shown significant effects on tolerance to various environmental stresses in morphs and effect of this acclimation persist for long durations. Desiccation and cold stress tolerance was increased after adult acclimation for respective stress in the dark morph; while tolerance of the light morph was not affected. Further, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance of the light morph was increased after adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> acclimation with no influence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance of the dark morph. Our results suggest a possible role of adult acclimation in successful invasion and adaptation of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities. Future experiments should be carried out to determine whether the survival in adverse conditions of low <i>versus</i> high temperature and humidity during seasonal changes is assisted by different acclimation abilities of the two morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i>.</p>

The phosphorylation status of Ascl1 is a key determinant of neuronal differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of neurons from patient fibroblasts using a combination of developmentally defined transcription factors has great potential in disease modelling, as well as ultimately for use in re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion and repair. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of physiologically mature neurons <i>in vitro</i> remains problematic. Here we demonstrate the cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of a key reprogramming transcription factor, Ascl1, on multiple serine-proline sites. This multisite phosphorylation is a crucial regulator of the ability of Ascl1 to drive neuronal differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> in the developing embryo; a phosphomutant form of Ascl1 shows substantially enhanced neuronal induction activity in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos. Mechanistically, we see that this un(der)phosphorylated Ascl1 is resistant to inhibition by both cyclin-dependent kinase activity and Notch signalling, both of which normally limit its neurogenic potential. Ascl1 is a central component of reprogramming transcription factor cocktails to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e neurons from human fibroblasts; the use of phosphomutant Ascl1 in place of the wild-type protein significantly promotes neuronal maturity after human fibroblast reprogramming <i>in vitro</i>. These results demonstrate that cell-cycle-dependent post-translational modification of proneural proteins directly regulates neuronal differentiation <i>in vivo</i> during development, and that this regulatory mechanism can be harnessed to promote maturation of neurons obtained by transdifferentiation of human cells <i>in vitro</i>.</p>

Plate fixation <i>versus</i> intramedullary nailing of completely displaced midshaft fractures of the clavicle
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This is a prospective randomised controlled trial comparing the   functional outcomes of plate fixation and elastic stable intramedullary   nailing (ESIN) of completely displaced mid-shaft fractures of the   clavicle in the active adult population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively recruited 123 patients and randomised them to   either plate fixation or ESIN. Patients completed the Quick Disabilities   of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score at one to six weeks post-operatively.   They were followed up at six weeks, three and six months and one   year with radiographs, and their clinical outcome was assessed using   both the DASH and the Constant Score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Plate fixation provided a faster functional recovery during the   first six months compared with ESIN, but there was no difference   after one year. The duration of surgery was shorter for ESIN (mean   53.4 minutes, 22 to 120) than for plate fixation (mean 69.7 minutes,   35 to 106, p < 0.001). The recovery after ESIN was slower with   increasing fracture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comminut</span></strong>ion and with open reduction (p <   0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both methods return the patients to their pre-injury functional   levels, but plate fixation has a faster recovery period in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comminut</span></strong>ed   fractures than ESIN. ESIN has a shorter operative time and lower   infection and implant rates of failure when using 2.5 mm nails or   wider, suggesting that this is the preferred method in mid-shaft   fractures with no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comminut</span></strong>ion, whereas plate fixation is the superior   method in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comminut</span></strong>ed fractures.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1095â€“1101</p></sec>

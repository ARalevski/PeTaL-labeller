Gene expression profiles of brain endothelial cells during embryonic development at bulk and single-cell levels
<p>The blood-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> barrier is a dynamic interface that separates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> from the circulatory system, and it is formed by highly specialized endothelial cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, we generated high-resolution gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> endothelial cells using translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and analyzed the vascular translatomes of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> at different time points during embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the blood-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> barrier, we also compared the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> endothelial translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional cofactor β-catenin (<i>Ctnnb1</i>). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes during the embryonic development of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> endothelium. We identified genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> endothelium–specific transcription factors (<i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxl2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, <i>Zfp551</i>, and <i>Zic3</i>) that are associated with maturation of the blood-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> barrier and act downstream of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway. Profiling of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> endothelial cells revealed substantial heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance of <i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, or <i>Zic3</i> transcripts correlated with the increased expression of genes encoding markers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> endothelial cell differentiation. Expression of <i>Foxf2</i> and <i>Zic3</i> in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced the production of blood-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> barrier differentiation markers. This comprehensive data set may help to improve the engineering of in vitro blood-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> barrier models.</p>

Analysis of shared heritability in common disorders of the brain
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> can exhibit considerable epidemiological comorbidity and often share symptoms, provoking debate about their etiologic overlap. We quantified the genetic sharing of 25 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers from genome-wide association studies of 265,218 patients and 784,643 control participants and assessed their relationship to 17 phenotypes from 1,191,588 individuals. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psychiatri</span></strong>c <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers share common variant risk, whereas neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers appear more distinct from one another and from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psychiatri</span></strong>c <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers. We also identified significant sharing between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers and a number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> phenotypes, including cognitive measures. Further, we conducted simulations to explore how statistical power, diagnostic misclassification, and phenotypic heterogeneity affect genetic correlations. These results highlight the importance of common genetic variation as a risk factor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers and the value of heritability-based methods in understanding their etiology.</p>

Supporting recovery from brain injury
<p>The beauty and intricacy of the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> is unfortunately also mirrored by its vulnerability. Damage to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> is typically permanent. Because cells of the adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, apart from rare exceptions, no longer divide, there is essentially no regrowth of damaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> tissue. Acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injury in the majority of cases occurs directly through traumatic events such as an accident involving a blow to the head or indirectly through interruption of the blood supply, namely a stroke. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injury is a major burden, with an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffering a traumatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injury and nearly 800,000 Americans suffering a stroke each year (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, current treatment options for such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injuries are still limited and are focused on the first hours after the insult. On page 50 of this issue, Abe <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a new approach in mouse and primate models that aims to enhance the ability of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> to regain functionality in the days and weeks after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injury.</p>

Assembling human brain organoids
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> development is a remarkable self-organization process in which cells proliferate, differentiate, migrate, and wire to form functional neural circuits. In humans, this process takes place over a long fetal phase and continues into the postnatal period, but it is largely inaccessible for direct, functional investigation at a cellular level. Therefore, the features that make the human central nervous system unique and the sequence of molecular and cellular events underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers remain largely uncharted. Human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells, including those obtained by reprogramming somatic cells, have the ability to self-organize and differentiate when grown in three-dimensional (3D) aggregates rather than in direct contact with a flat plastic surface (<i>1</i>). Such 3D neural cultures, also known as organoids and organ spheroids, recapitulate many aspects of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> development in vitro (<i>1</i>) and have the potential to accelerate progress in human neurobiology. Here, I discuss the emerging approaches to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> assembloids—the next generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> organoids that combine multiple cell lineages in 3D. These cultures can be used to model interactions between various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> regions in vitro, and ultimately may be applied to understand the assembly of neural circuits and to capture complex cell-cell interactions in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>.</p>

New dimensions for brain mapping
<p>The representation of memory in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> is one of the unresolved questions in neuroscience. A key feature of learning and memory is the process of neuroplasticity—the ability of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> to remodel structurally and functionally as a result of cognitive experience. Although the neurobiological basis of this process (that is, synaptic plasticity) is well established, the system level dynamics of neuroplasticity are still unclear. Recently, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), which can be carried out noninvasively in humans, provided a new approach to explore neuroplasticity. One of the parameters extracted from DW-MRI is mean diffusivity (MD) of water molecules, which is a biomarker of tissue microstructure (<i>1</i>). By probing changes in MD across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, areas of microstructural plasticity can be detected within hours of learning. On page 1045 of this issue, Brodt <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) used DW-MRI after an object-location memory task and found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> plasticity occurs in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) rather than in the hippocampus. Furthermore, they demonstrated that localized DW-MRI changes follow the basic definition of a memory engram (the physical manifestation of memories stored in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>). These observations go beyond the understanding of memory representation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>. Probing MD with DW-MRI appears to provide a detailed and comprehensive monitoring of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> microanatomy, revealing uncharted relations between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> structure and function.</p>

Breathing to inspire and arouse
<p>Breathing is one of the perpetual rhythms of life that is often taken for granted, its apparent simplicity belying the complex neural machinery involved. This behavior is more complicated than just producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inspir</span></strong>ation, as breathing is integrated with many other motor functions such as vocalization, orofacial motor behaviors, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional expression (laughing and crying), and locomotion (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). In addition, cognition can strongly influence breathing. Conscious breathing during yoga, meditation, or psychotherapy can modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion, arousal state, or stress (<i>3</i>). Therefore, understanding the links between breathing behavior, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> arousal state, and higher-order <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> activity is of great interest. On page 1411 of this issue, Yackle <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) identify an apparently specialized, molecularly identifiable, small subset of ∼350 neurons in the mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> that forms a circuit for transmitting information about respiratory activity to other central nervous system neurons, specifically with a group of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>stem, that influences arousal state (see the figure). This finding provides new insight into how the motor act of breathing can influence higher-order <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> functions.</p>

Astrocyte-shed extracellular vesicles regulate the peripheral leukocyte response to inflammatory brain lesions
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injury induces a peripheral acute cytokine response that directs the transmigration of leukocytes into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>. Because this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>-to-peripheral immune communication affects patient recovery, understanding its regulation is important. Using a mouse model of inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> injury, we set out to find a soluble mediator for this phenomenon. We found that extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed from astrocytes in response to intracerebral injection of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) rapidly entered into peripheral circulation and promoted the transmigration of leukocytes through modulation of the peripheral acute cytokine response. Bioinformatic analysis of the protein and microRNA cargo of EVs identified peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) as a primary molecular target of astrocyte-shed EVs. We confirmed in mice that astrocytic EVs promoted the transmigration of leukocytes into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> by inhibiting PPARα, resulting in the increase of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity that triggered the production of cytokines in liver. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms regulating communication between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> and peripheral immune system and identify astrocytic EVs as a molecular regulator of the immunological response to inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> damage.</p>

Normative brain size variation and brain shape diversity in humans
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> size variation over primate evolution and human development is associated with shifts in the proportions of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> regions. Individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> size can vary almost twofold among typically developing humans, but the consequences of this for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> organization remain poorly understood. Using in vivo neuroimaging data from more than 3000 individuals, we find that larger human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s show greater areal expansion in distributed frontoparietal cortical networks and related subcortical regions than in limbic, sensory, and motor systems. This areal redistribution recapitulates cortical remodeling across evolution, manifests by early childhood in humans, and is linked to multiple markers of heightened metabolic cost and neuronal connectivity. Thus, human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> shape is systematically coupled to naturally occurring variations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> size through a scaling map that integrates spatiotemporally diverse aspects of neurobiology.</p>

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered structures give rise to intriguing phenomena owing to the complex nature of their interaction with light. We report on photonic spin-symmetry breaking and unexpected spin-optical transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered geometric phase structure. Weak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er induces a photonic spin Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er leads to spin-split modes in momentum space, a random optical Rashba effect. Study of the momentum space entropy reveals an optical transition upon reaching a critical point where the structure’s anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular topology into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er strength. The photonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered geometric phase can serve as a platform for the study of different phenomena emerging from complex media involving spin-orbit coupling.</p>

Multiplex quantitative assays indicate a need for reevaluating reported small-molecule TrkB agonists
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), have emerged as key regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> plasticity and represent disease-modifying targets for several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers, including Alzheimer’s disease and major depressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er. Because of poor pharmacokinetic properties of BDNF, the interest in small-molecule TrkB agonists and modulators is high. Several compounds have been reported to act as TrkB agonists, and their increasing use in various nervous system <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er models creates the perception that these are reliable probes. To examine key pharmacological parameters of these compounds in detail, we have developed and optimized a series of complementary quantitative assays that measure TrkB receptor activation, TrkB-dependent downstream signaling, and gene expression in different cellular contexts. Although BDNF and other neurotrophic factors elicited robust and dose-dependent receptor activation and downstream signaling, we were unable to reproduce these activities using the reported small-molecule TrkB agonists. Our findings indicate that experimental results obtained with these compounds must be carefully interpreted and highlight the challenge of developing reliable pharmacological activators of this key molecular target.</p>

The cerebellum gets social
<p>The cerebellum contains the second main cortex of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> and ∼50% of the neurons that constitute the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>. Although the cerebellum has long been thought to subserve motor learning and coordination, more recently it has been recognized to take part in cognitive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional processing. Additionally, evidence for cerebellar involvement in autism spectrum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er (ASD), schizophrenia, and addiction is growing. On page 248 of this issue, Carta <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) extend this theme and show that the cerebellum can activate the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The VTA is a mesencephalic nucleus giving rise to the mesocortical and mesolimbic fiber bundles that release dopamine to the prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. Dopamine, in turn, plays a fundamental role in cognitive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional functioning by regulating motivation and reward. This places the cerebellum into the main circuits regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> states and social behavior.</p>

Transcriptome-wide isoform-level dysregulation in ASD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder
<p>Most genetic risk for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psychiatri</span></strong>c disease lies in regulatory regions, implicating pathogenic dysregulation of gene expression and splicing. However, comprehensive assessments of transcriptomic organization in diseased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s are limited. In this work, we integrated genotypes and RNA sequencing in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> samples from 1695 individuals with autism spectrum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er (ASD), schizophrenia, and bipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er, as well as controls. More than 25% of the transcriptome exhibits differential splicing or expression, with isoform-level changes capturing the largest disease effects and genetic enrichments. Coexpression networks isolate disease-specific neuronal alterations, as well as microglial, astrocyte, and interferon-response modules defining previously unidentified neural-immune mechanisms. We integrated genetic and genomic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study, prioritizing disease loci likely mediated by cis effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> expression.

Loss of a mammalian circular RNA locus causes miRNA deregulation and affects brain function
<p>Hundreds of circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant in the mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, often with conserved expression.

When the <i>Cdr1as</i> locus was removed from the mouse genome, knockout animals displayed impaired sensorimotor gating—a deficit in the ability to filter out unnecessary information—which is associated with neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psychiatri</span></strong>c <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers.

RasGRP1 promotes amphetamine-induced motor behavior through a Rhes interaction network (“Rhesactome”) in the striatum
<p>The striatum of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> coordinates motor function. Dopamine-related drugs may be therapeutic to patients with striatal neurodegeneration, such as Huntington’s disease (HD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), but these drugs have unwanted side effects. In addition to stimulating the release of norepinephrine, amphetamines, which are used for narcolepsy and attention-deficit/hyperactivity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er (ADHD), trigger dopamine release in the striatum. The guanosine triphosphatase Ras homolog enriched in the striatum (Rhes) inhibits dopaminergic signaling in the striatum, is implicated in HD and L-dopa–induced dyskinesia, and has a role in striatal motor control. We found that the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP1 inhibited Rhes-mediated control of striatal motor activity in mice. RasGRP1 stabilized Rhes, increasing its synaptic accumulation in the striatum. Whereas partially Rhes-deficient (<i>Rhes</i><sup><i>+/−</i></sup>) mice had an enhanced locomotor response to amphetamine, this phenotype was attenuated by coincident depletion of RasGRP1. By proteomic analysis of striatal lysates from <i>Rhes</i>-heterozygous mice with wild-type or partial or complete knockout of <i>Rasgrp1</i>, we identified a diverse set of Rhes-interacting proteins, the “Rhesactome,” and determined that RasGRP1 affected the composition of the amphetamine-induced Rhesactome, which included PDE2A (phosphodiesterase 2A; a protein associated with major depressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er), LRRC7 (leucine-rich repeat–containing 7; a protein associated with bipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er and ADHD), and DLG2 (discs large homolog 2; a protein associated with chronic pain). Thus, this Rhes network provides insight into striatal effects of amphetamine and may aid the development of strategies to treat various neurological and psychological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers associated with the striatal dysfunction.</p>

<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> is involved in the behavioral and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased activity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission increased neuronal excitability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic excitability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic excitability, reduced GABAergic transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased activity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF exposure. Activating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA activity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic excitability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers.</p>

Adult neurogenesis in mammals
<p>The first claim, in the early 1960s, that neurons could be generated in the postnatal mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> was met with considerable skepticism and controversy (<i>1</i>). Over the next 20 years, each subsequent study reporting adult neurogenesis in the mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> was greeted similarly (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). A dogma had been established and accepted by the scientific community: After birth, no new neurons could be generated. Conceptually, it was thought that the structural composition of the neurons within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> remained unchangeable after birth. However, the detection of adult neurogenesis in certain regions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> suggested that the adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> exhibits more plasticity than previously thought, and this has implications for concepts of self, memory, and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known systems carrying out complex computations were biological nervous systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> circuits as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent computation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>-like circuits (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical circuitry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep network” (or deep net) architecture, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inspir</span></strong>ed model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI systems has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central areas of AI research, including computer vision, speech recognition and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as computer vision and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> circuitry could supply cues for guiding network models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

Observation of the topological Anderson insulator in disordered atomic wires
<p>Topology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er have a rich combined influence on quantum transport. To probe their interplay, we synthesized one-dimensional chiral symmetric wires with controllable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er via spectroscopic Hamiltonian engineering, based on the laser-driven coupling of discrete momentum states of ultracold atoms. Measuring the bulk evolution of a topological indicator after a sudden quench, we observed the topological Anderson insulator phase, in which added <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er drives the band structure of a wire from topologically trivial to nontrivial. In addition, we observed the robustness of topologically nontrivial wires to weak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er and measured the transition to a trivial phase in the presence of strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er. Atomic interactions in this quantum simulation platform may enable realizations of strongly interacting topological fluids.</p>

Scaling of human brain size
<p>What makes humans unique as a species and as individuals? Our uniqueness stems from language, tool use, reasoning, and other cognitive abilities that are largely mediated by specialized regions of the cerebral cortex. These regions of higher cognitive function have expanded disproportionately during human evolution (compared with nonhuman primates) and during postnatal maturation, when cortical surface area expands threefold between infancy and adulthood (<i>1</i>). Our uniqueness as individuals reflects countless differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> structure, function, and connectivity. One basic anatomical difference between similarly aged individuals is a more than 1.5-fold variation in total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> size (and total cortical volume) (<i>2</i>). On page 1222 of this issue, Reardon <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) bring this aspect of individual variability under the umbrella of “differential scaling” by showing that human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s of different sizes do not scale uniformly across all regions. Rather, larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s show greater expansion in regions associated with higher cognition and less expansion in regions associated with sensory, motor, and limbic (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion- and affect-related) functions.</p>

Crystallizing a memory
<p>What is the physical basis of memory? What does it take to retrieve a memory in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>? What would it take to activate or erase memories? In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to denote the physical manifestation of a memory in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb posited a physiological correlate for learning and recollection: The process of learning strengthens the connections, or synapses, between neurons, which leads to the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>-wide cell assemblies that undergo changes in their structural and functional connectivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these assemblies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during learning (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable neuronal correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent memories are formed, the dynamics of these assemblies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> processes the variety of memories an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> and modulate them in a synapse-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate memories to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

Early life experience shapes neural genome
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> is constantly changing in response to environmental experiences throughout life. Mounting evidence from animal and human studies suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> development and behavior are influenced by early life experiences. Several compelling experimental models have been developed to study the effect of early life experiences on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, such as stress, exposure to toxins, availability of nutrients, adversity, and quality of maternal care (<i>1</i>). The relationship between genes and environment on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> and how they affect behavior has been a long-standing issue. Can the genome of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> cells be changed by environmental factors? If so, which types of genetic changes can result? What is the molecular basis of this genetic diversity? What are the physiological implications? On page 1395 of this issue, Bedrosian <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) explore one possibility for how neuronal genomes can exhibit plasticity in response to environmental factors during early life, providing integrative evidence for the effect of early maternal care on the genomes of neurons.</p>

Shared molecular neuropathology across major psychiatric disorders parallels polygenic overlap
<p>The predisposition to neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psychiatri</span></strong>c disease involves a complex, polygenic, and pleiotropic genetic architecture. However, little is known about how genetic variants impart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> dysfunction or pathology. We used transcriptomic profiling as a quantitative readout of molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>-based phenotypes across five major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psychiatri</span></strong>c <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers—autism, schizophrenia, bipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er, depression, and alcoholism—compared with matched controls. We identified patterns of shared and distinct gene-expression perturbations across these conditions. The degree of sharing of transcriptional dysregulation is related to polygenic (single-nucleotide polymorphism–based) overlap across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers, suggesting a substantial causal genetic component. This comprehensive systems-level view of the neurobiological architecture of major neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">psychiatri</span></strong>c illness demonstrates pathways of molecular convergence and specificity.</p>

Parsing reward from aversion
<p>Starting from the moment we hear our alarms in the morning, our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ions guide the thousands of decisions we make every day. More specifically, it is the valence of our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ions that determines our subsequent behavior. Valence is a concept that was originally defined in psychology and corresponds to the value we assign to the perceptions of our external and internal environments (<i>1</i>). Valence varies from negative, when we are afraid or anxious, to positive, when we are happy or peaceful. In the case of the morning alarm, if your <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional state has a positive valence you might jump out of bed, eager to engage with whatever is motivating you. Conversely, if your <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ional state has a negative valence, you might choose to stay in bed to Avoid the causes of your negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ions.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple myelin sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid nerve conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> is composed of myelinated nerves (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> also adapt as neural circuits are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural circuits? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

Cerebellar modulation of the reward circuitry and social behavior
<p>The cerebellum has been implicated in a number of nonmotor mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers such as autism spectrum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er, schizophrenia, and addiction. However, its contribution to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers is not well understood.

Optogenetic activation of the cerebello-VTA projections was rewarding and, in a three-chamber social task, these projections were more active when the animal explored the social chamber. Intriguingly, activity in the cerebello-VTA pathway was required for the mice to show social preference in this task. Our data delineate a major, previously unappreciated role for the cerebellum in controlling the reward circuitry and social behavior.</p>

Spatiotemporal transcriptomic divergence across human and macaque brain development
<p>Human nervous system development is an intricate and protracted process that requires precise spatiotemporal transcriptional regulation. We generated tissue-level and single-cell transcriptomic data from up to 16 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> regions covering prenatal and postnatal rhesus macaque development. Integrative analysis with complementary human data revealed that global intraspecies (ontogenetic) and interspecies (phylogenetic) regional transcriptomic differences exhibit concerted cup-shaped patterns, with a late fetal-to-infancy (perinatal) convergence. Prenatal neocortical transcriptomic patterns revealed transient topographic gradients, whereas postnatal patterns largely reflected functional hierarchy. Genes exhibiting heterotopic and heterochronic divergence included those transiently enriched in the prenatal prefrontal cortex or linked to autism spectrum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er and schizophrenia.

Facing your fears
<p>Remembering traumatic fearful events is adaptive. However, treating no-longer-threatening situations as dangerous may be maladaptive and lead to anxiety <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers, including phobias and posttraumatic stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er. Central to many forms of therapy designed to tackle these anxiety <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers is the idea that to overcome fear, one needs to face it. For instance, cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy allow patients to confront the objects or situations that provoke their anxiety in the controlled environment of the therapist's office. With repeated exposures, the patients' anxiety levels gradually decline, and the objects or situations that they once feared no longer trouble them. On page 1239 of this issue Khalaf <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) provide a neural mechanism in mice for “facing one's fears.” These findings may inform the development of more effective forms of treatment for anxiety <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers.</p>

Near-infrared deep brain stimulation via upconversion nanoparticle–mediated optogenetics
<p>Optogenetics has revolutionized the experimental interrogation of neural circuits and holds promise for the treatment of neurological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ers. It is limited, however, because visible light cannot penetrate deep inside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> tissue. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) absorb tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light and emit wavelength-specific visible light. Here, we demonstrate that molecularly tailored UCNPs can serve as optogenetic actuators of transcranial NIR light to stimulate deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> neurons. Transcranial NIR UCNP-mediated optogenetics evoked dopamine release from genetically tagged neurons in the ventral tegmental area, induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> oscillations through activation of inhibitory neurons in the medial septum, silenced seizure by inhibition of hippocampal excitatory cells, and triggered memory recall. UCNP technology will enable less-invasive optical neuronal activity manipulation with the potential for r<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>e therapy.</p>

Elderly chimps may get Alzheimer's disease
<p>Researchers have discovered tell-tale signs of Alzheimer's disease in 20 elderly chimpanzee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>s, rekindling a decades-old debate over whether humans are the only species that develop the debilitating condition. By examining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> regions afflicted by Alzheimer's in humans, the team discovered that 13 chimps had amyloid plaques, and four also had the neurofibrillary tangles typical of more advanced stages of Alzheimer's. Whether chimps actually succumb to Alzheimer's or are immune from symptoms despite having the key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> abnormalities is unclear, because there were no behavioral data to indicate that these animals developed dementia. But either way, the work suggests that chimps could help scientists better understand the disease and how to fight it. And although some scientists are eager to begin new studies on chimps, but many wonder whether such research on these now-endangered animals will receive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moral</span></strong>, or monetary, support.</p>

Can immunotherapy treat neurodegeneration?
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating age-related neurodegenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er and the most frequent cause of senile dementia. The appearance of cognitive decline in this disease is associated with synaptic and neuronal loss, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, the accumulation of intracellular and extracellular plaques of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, and local neuroinflammation. The major focus in AD therapeutics has been to directly target specific factors in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> that are believed to be associated with pathogenesis—primarily Ab and tau proteins—by using immunological or pharmacological tools. However, in the clinic, these therapies have not shown efficacy in restoring cognitive function nor in arresting the disease course. In addition, treating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> inflammation, which often accompanies neurodegenerative diseases, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has shown limited or no effect on disease progression (<i>1</i>). Collectively, these results have led investigators to revisit the identification of the factors participating in AD and in particular the role of the immune system, including the resident <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> myeloid cells (microglia) and the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.</p>

Observation of Anderson localization in disordered nanophotonic structures
<p>Anderson localization is an interference effect crucial to the understanding of waves in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered media. However, localization is expected to become negligible when the features of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered structure are much smaller than the wavelength. Here we experimentally demonstrate the localization of light in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>ered dielectric multilayer with an average layer thickness of 15 nanometers, deep into the subwavelength regime. We observe strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disord</span></strong>er-induced reflections that show that the interplay of localization and evanescence can lead to a substantial decrease in transmission, or the opposite feature of enhanced transmission. This deep-subwavelength Anderson localization exhibits extreme sensitivity: Varying the thickness of a single layer by 2 nanometers changes the reflection appreciably. This sensitivity, approaching the atomic scale, holds the promise of extreme subwavelength sensing.</p>

Rogue protein's partners offer hope in Parkinson's disease
<p>It has been 8 years since an astonishing observation persuaded many scientists that the misfolded protein implicated in Parkinson's disease spreads from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> cell to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> cell, like an infection. Last week, findings presented at the huge annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience further buttressed the theory that spread of the rogue protein, called α-synuclein, is responsible for the progressive disease, which is marked by tremor, stiff movements, depression, and, ultimately, dementia. Scientists at the San Diego, California, conference also described their discovery that an obscure protein carried on the cell membranes of neurons and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> cells blocks the uptake of the α-synuclein into cells. Little is known about TM9SF2, but it is part of a family of proteins that span the cell membrane and indications are that it may work to transport specific molecules from the outside to the inside of the cell. It is made in abundance in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, especially in regions where damage to dopamine-producing neurons is known to give rise to Parkinson's. If it emerges that it is indeed a "catcher's mitt" for α-synuclein, it could provide a drug target for a disease whose 10 million sufferers are sorely in need of new medicines. The same goes for another cell membrane protein, LAG-3, which is present in neurons and which was recently described in <i>Science </i>as binding tightly to the rogue Parkinson's protein.</p>

How the body learns to hurt
<p>After 50 years, the neuroscience of pain has a new player. In 1966, researchers traced how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> learns from repeated stimulation. They found that triggering neurons in one part of the hippocampus—a sliver of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> tissue key to memory—can make linked, distant neurons more likely to fire for many hours afterward, a phenomenon now known as long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP leaves its mark by strengthening some connections between synapses–the connections between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> cells—and not others. Now, researchers have found a new type of LTP that may explain how pain itself "teaches" the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>. The pain-related LTP is driven not by neuronal activity, but by glia—nonneuronal cells that protect neurons from injury, among other duties.</p>

Unexpected rewards induce dopamine-dependent positive emotion–like state changes in bumblebees
<p>Whether invertebrates exhibit positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion–like states and what mechanisms underlie such states remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that bumblebees exhibit dopamine-dependent positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion–like states across behavioral contexts. After training with one rewarding and one unrewarding cue, bees that received pretest sucrose responded in a positive manner toward ambiguous cues. In a second experiment, pretest consumption of sucrose solution resulted in a shorter time to reinitiate foraging after a simulated predator attack. These behavioral changes were abolished with topical application of the dopamine antagonist fluphenazine. Further experiments established that pretest sucrose does not simply cause bees to become more exploratory. Our findings present a new opportunity for understanding the fundamental neural elements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ions and may alter the view of how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emot</span></strong>ion states affect decision-making in animals.</p>

A Price to Pay for Adult Neurogenesis
<p>We tend to believe that plasticity is what makes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> circuits adaptable to continuous changes in environmental demands and that greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> plasticity should result in a better ability to cope with the surrounding world. To adapt to everyday life, animals explore, learn, and remember, and these tasks make use of various cortical structures, including the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus, part of the hippocampus, is a remarkable structure in that it is one of two areas of the adult mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, including the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, that continue to generate new neurons throughout postnatal life (<i>1</i>). It is well established that adult-born neurons integrate into preexisting neuronal networks and participate in information processing (<i>2</i>). Much evidence accumulated over the past decade supports the hypothesis that adult neurogenesis itself is a type of circuit plasticity required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory recall. The work by Akers <i>et al.</i> on page 598 of this issue (<i>3</i>) now shows that adult hippocampal neurogenesis may also promote forgetting.</p>

Neuronal Activity Promotes Oligodendrogenesis and Adaptive Myelination in the Mammalian Brain
<sec><title>On-Demand Activity</title><p>Oligodendroglia ensheath axons in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> with myelin, which provides the insulation that speeds up transmission of neuronal electrical impulses. The process of myelination in the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> goes on for decades, concurrent with all manner of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> development and cognitive activity. <bold>Gibson <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 10.1126/science.1252304, published online 10 April; see the Perspective by <bold>Bechler and ffrench-Constant</bold>) used optogenetics to study myelination in response to neural activity. Electrical activity in the motor cortex of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> of awake mice led to proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocytes and consequently increased myelination and alterations in motor response.</p></sec>

A Trace of Your Place
<p>How do you know where you are? How do you generate or remember a mental map of your surroundings? Spatial cognition arises from multiple neural systems in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> that converge to provide this awareness. Teasing out the origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> signals that course through these networks is tremendously difficult because the number and nature of pathways in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> that give rise to a particular signal—the afferent inputs—are often not known. This becomes even more complicated if one looks for connectivity along these pathways at the level of single neurons, the most elementary operating units in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong>, because of the thousands of connections a neuron can make with other neurons. On page 44 of this issue, Zhang <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) tackle this question by identifying the afferent cells in the entorhinal cortex—a region associated with navigation and memory—that send signals to the hippocampus, specifically to “place cells,” neurons that become active in response to a specific location in an environment. The scheme that emerges establishes functional connectivity at an unprecedented level of detail.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Shoot Removal Induces Chloroplast Development in Roots via Cytokinin Signaling
<p>The development of plant chloroplasts is regulated by various developmental, environmental, and hormonal cues. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast development is repressed in roots via auxin signaling. However, roots develop chloroplasts when they are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detach</span></strong>ed from the shoot. In contrast to auxin, cytokinin positively affects chloroplast development in roots, but the role and signaling pathway of cytokinin in the root greening response remain unclear. To understand the regulatory pathways of chloroplast development in the plant stress response, we examined the mechanisms underlying the conditional greening of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detach</span></strong>ed roots. In wild-type Arabidopsis roots, shoot removal activates type B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-mediated cytokinin signaling and induces chlorophyll accumulation and photosynthetic remodeling. ARR1 and ARR12 are essential for up-regulating nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detach</span></strong>ed roots. In this process, WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION1 and class B GATA transcription factors (B-GATAs) act upstream and downstream of ARRs, respectively. Overexpression of B-GATAs promotes root greening, as does shoot removal, dependent on a light signaling transcription factor, LONG HYPOCOTYL5. Auxin represses the root greening response independent of ARR signaling. <i>GNC-LIKE</i> (<i>GNL</i>), a B-GATA, is strongly up-regulated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detach</span></strong>ed roots via ARR1 and ARR12 but is repressed by auxin, so <i>GNL</i> may function at the point of convergence of cytokinin and auxin signaling in the root greening response.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Developmental Brain Gene <i>NPAS3</i> Contains the Largest Number of Accelerated Regulatory Sequences in the Human Genome
<p>To identify the evolutionary genetic novelties that contributed to shape human-specific traits such as the use of a complex language, long-term planning and exceptional learning abilities is one of the ultimate frontiers of modern biology. Evolutionary signatures of functional shifts could be detected by comparing noncoding regions that are highly conserved across mammals or primates and rapidly accumulated nucleotide substitutions only in the lineage leading to humans. As gene loci densely populated with human-accelerated elements (HAEs) are more likely to have contributed to human-specific novelties, we sought to identify the transcriptional units and genomic 1 Mb intervals of the entire human genome carrying the highest number of HAEs. To this end, we took advantage of four available data sets of human genomic accelerated regions obtained through different comparisons and algorithms and performed a meta-analysis of the combined data. We found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> developmental transcription factor <i>neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3</i> (<i>NPAS3</i>) contains the largest cluster of noncoding-accelerated regions in the human genome with up to 14 elements that are highly conserved in mammals, including primates, but carry human-specific nucleotide substitutions. We then tested the ability of the 14 HAEs identified at the <i>NPAS3</i> locus to act as transcriptional regulatory sequences in a reporter expression assay performed in transgenic zebrafish. We found that 11 out of the 14 HAEs present in <i>NPAS3</i> act as transcriptional enhancers during development, particularly within the nervous system. As <i>NPAS3</i> is known to play a crucial role during mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> development, our results indicate that the high density of HAEs present in the human <i>NPAS3</i> locus could have modified the spatiotemporal expression pattern of <i>NPAS3</i> in the developing human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> and, therefore, contributed to human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brain</span></strong> evolution.</p>

Periprosthetic femoral fractures and trying to avoid them
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Periprosthetic femoral fractures (PFF) following total hip arthroplasty   (THA) are devastating complicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s that are associated with funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al   limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and increased overall mortality. Although cementless   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>s have been associated with an increased risk of PFF, the   precise contribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong> geometry and design on the risk   of both intra-operative and post-operative PFF remains poorly investigated.   A systematic review was performed to aggregate all of the PFF literature   with specific attent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to the femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong> used.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A systematic search strategy of several journal databases and   recent proceedings from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons   was performed. Clinical articles were included for analysis if sufficient   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong> descript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was provided. All articles were reviewed by   two reviewers. A review of fundamental investigat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>   load-to-failure was performed, with the intent of identifying similar   conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s from the clinical and fundamental literature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total 596 articles were initially identified, with 34 being   eligible for analysis. Aggregate analysis of 1691 PFFs in 342 719   primary THAs revealed a significantly higher number of PFFs with   cementless femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>s (p < 0.001). Single-wedge and double-wedge   (fit-and-fill) femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>s were associated with a threefold   increase in PFF rates (p < 0.001) compared with anatomical, fully   coated and tapered/rounded stems. Within cemented stems, loaded-taper   (Exeter) stems were associated with more PFFs than composite-beam   (Charnley) stems (p = 0.004).

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>).   Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA.

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolyte with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper–lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF<sub>3</sub>) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and defluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in a fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature.

Risk factors for wear-related failures after hip resurfacing in patients with a low contact patch to rim distance
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A contact patch to rim (CPR) distance of < 10 mm has been   associated with edge-loading and excessive wear. However, not all   arthroplasties with a low CPR distance show problems with wear.   Therefore, CPR distance may not be the only variable affecting the   post-operative metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used multiple logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to determine what variables   differed between the patients who had high and low cobalt (CoS)   and chromium (CrS) serum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s within a cohort of patients   with low (< 10 mm) CPR distances. A total of 56 patients treated   with unilateral hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) had CoS and CrS   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> studies performed more than one year after surgery.

Age and Outcomes of Primary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The DANISH study (Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs [<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>able Cardioverter Defibrillators] in Patients With Non-Ischemic Systolic Heart Failure on Mortality) did not demonstrate an overall effect on all-cause mortality with ICD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

Association Between Midwall Late Gadolinium Enhancement and Sudden Cardiac Death in Patients With Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Mild and Moderate Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current guidelines only recommend the use of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>able cardioverter defibrillator in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy for the primary prevent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in those with a left ventricular eject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (LVEF) <35%.

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other monatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for proton channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair. The dynamic, reversible format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multinuclear sites from mobilized single atoms represents a distinct phenomenon that falls outside the convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al boundaries of a heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst.</p>

Extracellular Matrix Proteomics Reveals Interplay of Aggrecan and Aggrecanases in Vascular Remodeling of Stented Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling contributes to in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Despite its important clinical implicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, little is known about ECM changes post–stent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Bare-metal and drug-eluting stents were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>ed in pig coronary arteries with an overstretch under optical coherence tomography guidance. Stented segments were harvested 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-stenting for proteomics analysis of the media and neointima.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 151 ECM and ECM-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. After stent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, proteins involved in regulating calcificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> were upregulated in the neointima of drug-eluting stents. The earliest changes in the media were proteins involved in inflammat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and thrombosis, followed by changes in regulatory ECM proteins. By day 28, basement membrane proteins were reduced in drug-eluting stents in comparison with bare-metal stents. In contrast, the large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was increased. Aggrecanases of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family contribute to the catabolism of vascular proteoglycans. An increase in ADAMTS-specific aggrecan fragments was accompanied by a notable shift from <i>ADAMTS1</i> and <i>ADAMTS5</i> to <i>ADAMTS4</i> gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> after stent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Immunostaining in human stented coronary arteries confirmed the presence of aggrecan and aggrecan fragments, in particular, at the contacts of the stent struts with the artery. Further investigat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of aggrecan presence in the human vasculature revealed that aggrecan and aggrecan cleavage were more abundant in human arteries than in human veins. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, aggrecan synthesis was induced on grafting a vein into the arterial circulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, suggesting an important role for aggrecan in vascular plasticity. Finally, lack of ADAMTS-5 activity in mice resulted in an accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of aggrecan and a dilat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the thoracic aorta, confirming that aggrecanase activity regulates aggrecan abundance in the arterial wall and contributes to vascular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s:</title><p>Significant differences were identified by proteomics in the ECM of coronary arteries after bare-metal and drug-eluting stent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>at<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, most notably an upregulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of aggrecan, a major ECM component of cartilaginous tissues that confers resistance to compress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of aggrecan coincided with a shift in <i>ADAMTS</i> gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

Atrial Fibrillation and Ventricular Arrhythmias
<p>Sex-specific differences in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes of atrial fibrillat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (AF), sustained ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death are recognized. Sex hormones cause differences in cardiac electrophysiological parameters between men and women that may affect the risk for arrhythmias. The incidence and prevalence of AF is lower in women than in men. However, because women live longer and AF prevalence increases with age, the absolute number of women with AF exceeds that of men. Women with AF are more symptomatic, present with more atypical symptoms, and report worse quality of life in comparison with men. Female sex is an independent risk factor for death or stroke attributable to AF. Oral anticoagulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> therapy for stroke prevent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> has similar efficacy for men and women, but older women treated with warfarin have a higher residual risk of stroke in comparison with men.

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

Toward an optically controlled brain
<p>Neurons can be modified with light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels, which cause them to become excited upon illuminat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). This discovery has given rise to the field of optogenetics, with impressive examples such as triggering the beat of a heart with light (<i>3</i>). There is, however, one technical limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>: Light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels are typically stimulated with blue-green light, which is heavily scattered by tissue. Thus, deep brain stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, focused on small reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, is a major challenge. On page 679 of this issue, Chen <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) use transgenic mice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>ed with upconverting nanoparticles (NPs) to locally activate light-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels and modulate neuronal activity, even deep inside the brain.

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p>Particle accelerat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by plasma waves and spontaneous wave generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>less plasmas. Such wave-particle interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of energy transfer in interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s associated with electromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> cyclotron waves. The observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are not symmetric around the magnetic field direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> but are in phase with the plasma wave fields. The wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> phase relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot protons to waves, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to energies up to ~2 kilo–electron volts.

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s approaching the size of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and water molecules. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, molecular separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

Carbon nanotube transistors scaled to a 40-nanometer footprint
<p>The Internat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors challenges the device research community to reduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> footprint containing all components to 40 nanometers within the next decade. We report on a p-channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong> scaled to such an extremely small dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Built on one semiconducting carbon nanotube, it occupies less than half the space of leading silicon technologies, while delivering a significantly higher pitch-normalized current density—above 0.9 milliampere per micrometer at a low supply voltage of 0.5 volts with a subthreshold swing of 85 millivolts per decade. Furthermore, we show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transistor</span></strong>s with the same small footprint built on actual high-density arrays of such nanotubes that deliver higher current than that of the best-competing silicon devices under the same overdrive, without any normalizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We achieve this using low-resistance end-bonded contacts, a high-purity semiconducting carbon nanotube source, and self-assembly to pack nanotubes into full surface-coverage aligned arrays.</p>

Epitaxial lift-off of electrodeposited single-crystal gold foils for flexible electronics
<p>We introduce a simple and inexpensive procedure for epitaxial lift-off of wafer-size flexible and transparent foils of single-crystal gold using silicon as a template. Lateral electrochemical undergrowth of a sacrificial SiO<i><sub>x</sub></i> layer was achieved by photoelectrochemically oxidizing silicon under light irradiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. A 28-nanometer-thick gold foil with a sheet resistance of 7 ohms per square showed only a 4% increase in resistance after 4000 bending cycles. A flexible organic light-emitting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diod</span></strong>e based on tris(bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) that was spin-coated on a foil exploited the transmittance and flexibility of the gold foil. Cuprous oxide as an inorganic semiconductor that was epitaxially electrodeposited onto the gold foils exhibited a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diod</span></strong>e quality factor <i>n</i> of 1.6 (where <i>n</i> = 1.0 for an ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diod</span></strong>e), compared with a value of 3.1 for a polycrystalline deposit. Zinc oxide nanowires electrodeposited epitaxially on a gold foil also showed flexibility, with the nanowires intact up to 500 bending cycles.</p>

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental quest<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by using extensive laboratory measurements of rates of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and a comparison with atmospheric observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s show that nearly all nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to sulfuric acid. A considerable fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, but the relatively weak dependence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s indicates that for the processes studied, variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the present-day atmosphere.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> current induced by muscarinic stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and distinct current–voltage relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with K<sup>+</sup>-free solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Cost effectiveness of patellofemoral <i>versus</i> total knee arthroplasty in younger patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) has experienced significant   improvements in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong> survivorship with second generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> designs.   This has renewed interest in PFA as an alternative to total knee   arthroplasty (TKA) for younger active patients with isolated patellofemoral   osteoarthritis (PF OA). We analysed the cost-effectiveness of PFA <i>versus</i> TKA   for the management of isolated PF OA in the United States-based   populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used a Markov transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> state model to compare cost-effectiveness   between PFA and TKA. Simulated patients were aged 60 (base case)   and 50 years. Lifetime costs (2015 United States dollars), quality-adjusted   life year (QALY) gains and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio   (ICER) were calculated from a healthcare payer perspective. Annual rates   of revis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> were derived from the Nat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al Joint Registry for England,   Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. Deterministic and probabilistic   sensitivity analysis was performed for all parameters against a   $50 000/QALY willingness to pay. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PFA was more expensive ($49 811 <i>versus</i> $46 632)   but more effective (14.3 QALYs <i>versus</i> 13.3 QALYs)   over a lifetime horizon. The ICER associated with the addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al   effectiveness of PFA was $3097. The model was mainly sensitive to utility   values, with PFA remaining cost-effective when its utility exceeded   that of TKA by at least 1.0%. PFA provided incremental benefits   at no increased cost when annual rates of revis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> decreased by   24.5%. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s</title><p>Recent improvements in rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong> of survival have made   PFA an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure in younger   patients, delaying TKA until <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong> failure or tibiofemoral OA   progress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The present study quantified the minimum required marginal   benefit for PFA to be cost-effective compared with TKA and identified survivorship   targets for PFA to become both less expensive and more effective.   These benchmarks might be used to assess clinical outcomes of PFA   from an economic standpoint within the United States healthcare   system.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1028–36.</p></sec>

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty

The stability of the hip after the use of a proximal femoral endoprosthesis for oncological indications
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Instability of the hip is the most common mode of failure after   reconstruct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a proximal femoral arthroplasty (PFA) using   an endoprosthesis after excis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a tumour. Small studies report   improved stability with capsular repair of the hip and other techniques,   but these have not been investigated in a large series of patients.   The aim of this study was to evaluate variables associated with   the patient and the operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that affect post-operative stability.   We hypothesised an associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between capsular repair and stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective cohort study, we identified 527 adult patients   who were treated with a PFA for tumours.

Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a standard length intramedullary cemented stem.

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to determine the rate of   progress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of osteoarthritis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong> survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been quest<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ed in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   alignment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   forces during static and dynamic weight-bearing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact forces and moments were measured in nine   patients with instrumented knee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>s. Medial force ratios were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend). Hip-knee-ankle angles in the frontal plane were analysed   using full-leg coronal radiographs. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The medial force ratio strongly correlated with the tibiofemoral   alignment in the static condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of one-legged stance (R² = 0.88)   and dynamic single-limb loading (R² = 0.59) with varus malalignment   leading to increased medial force ratios of up to 88%. In contrast,   the correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between leg alignment and magnitude of medial compartment force   was much less pronounced.

Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-thickness cartilage loss, it is occas<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally   used to treat those with partial-thickness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial thickness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial thickness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full thickness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full thickness loss on both the femur and tibia. The funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al   outcomes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong> survival and incidence of re-operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were assessed   at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial thickness cartilage loss, who had pre-operative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial thickness cartilage loss had significantly   worse funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively   compared with those with full thickness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial thickness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full thickness loss. Whilst there was no difference in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong> survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in knees with partial thickness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial thickness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al scores.

The <i>in vivo</i> effect of a porous titanium alloy flange with hydroxyapatite, silver and fibronectin coatings on soft-tissue integration of intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prostheses
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The Intraosseous Transcutaneous Amputat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Prosthesis (ITAP)   may improve quality of life for amputees by avoiding soft-tissue   complicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s associated with socket prostheses and by improving   sensory feedback and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. It relies on the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a seal   between the soft tissues and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong> and currently has a flange   with drilled holes to promote dermal attachment. Despite this, infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>   remains a significant risk.

Improving the accuracy of synovial fluid analysis in the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection with simple and inexpensive biomarkers
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to increase the diagnostic accuracy   of the analysis of synovial fluid in the differentiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of prosthetic   joint infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (PJI) by the addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of inexpensive biomarkers   such as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), adenosine deaminase   (ADA), alpha-2-macrogloblulin (α2M) and procalcitonin.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between January 2013 and December 2015, synovial fluid and removed   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>s were requested from 143 revis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> total joint arthroplasties.   A total of 55 patients met inclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> criteria of the receipt of   sufficient synovial fluid, tissue samples and removed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">implant</span></strong>s for   analysis.</p><p>The diagnosis of PJI followed the definit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from a recent Internat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al   Consensus Meeting to create two groups of patients; septic and aseptic.   Using receiver operating characteristic curves we determined the   cutoff values and diagnostic accuracy for each marker.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 23 PJIs and 32 patients with aseptic loosening. The   levels of total leucocyte count, proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of polymorphonuclear   leucocytes (PMNs), CRP, ADA and α2M in the synovial fluid were all   significantly higher in those with a PJI than in those with aseptic   loosening. The levels of procalcitonin were comparable in the two   groups.</p><p>Cutoff values for the optimal performance in the diagnosis of   infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> were: total leucocyte count > 1463 cells/μL (sensitivity   (Sens) 100%, specificity (Spec) 71.9%, positive predictive value   (PPV) 71.9%, negative predictive value (NPV) 100%); proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of   PMNs > 81% (Sens 78.3%, Spec 75.0%, PPV 69.2%, NPV 82.8%); CRP >   6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 93.8%, PPV 90.0%, NPV 85.7%); ADA > 61U/L   (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%) and α2M > 958 mg/L   (Sens 47.8%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 91.7%, NPV 72.1%).</p><p>The addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a raised level of CRP or ADA to the total leukocyte   count increased the specificity: total leukocyte count > 1463 cells/μL   and CRP > 6.7mg/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 86.5%) or   with ADA > 61U/L (Sens 78.3%, Spec 96.9%, PPV 94.7%, NPV 86.1%). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The total leucocyte count in the synovial fluid offers great   negative predictive value in the diagnosis of PJI and the addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>   of more specific markers such as CRP and ADA improves the positive   predictive value. Thus the addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of simple and inexpensive markers   to the measurement of the leucocyte count in the synovial fluid   may reduce the number of equivocal results which demand more expensive   investigat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:351–7.</p></sec>

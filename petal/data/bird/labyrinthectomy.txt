Lumbar surgery prior to total hip arthroplasty is associated with worse patient-reported outcomes
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to describe the prevalence of previous   lumbar surgery in patients who undergo total hip arthroplasty (THA)   and to investigate their patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) one y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>   post-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Data from the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register and the Swedish   Spine Register gathered between 2002 and 2012 were merged to identify   a group of patients who had undergone lumbar surgery before THA   (n = 997) and a carefully matched one-to-one control group. We investigated   differences in the one-y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> post-operative PROMs between the groups.   Lin<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> regression analyses were used to explore the associations   between previous lumbar surgery and these PROMs following THA. The   prevalence of prior lumbar surgery was calculated as the ratio of   patients identified with previous lumbar surgery between 2002 and   2012, and divided by the total number of patients who underwent   a THA in 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The prevalence of lumbar surgery prior to THA in 2012 was 3.5%   (351 of 10 082).

Effectiveness of open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (UKUFF)
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The appropriate management for patients with a degenerative t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>   of the rotator cuff remains controversial, but operative treatment,   particularly arthroscopic surgery, is increasingly being used. Our   aim in this paper was to compare the effectiveness of arthroscopic   with open repair of the rotator cuff.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 273 patients were recruited to a randomised comparison   trial (136 to arthroscopic surgery and 137 to open surgery) from   19 teaching and general hospitals in the United Kingdom. The surgeons   used their usual preferred method of repair. The Oxford Shoulder   Score (OSS), two y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s post-operatively, was the primary outcome   measure. Imaging of the shoulder was performed at one y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> after   surgery. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials,   ISRCTN97804283.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean OSS improved from 26.3 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   8.2) at baseline, to 41.7 (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) two y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s post-operatively   for arthroscopic surgery and from 25.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 8.0) to 41.5   (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) for open surgery. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis   showed no statistical difference between the groups at two y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s   (difference in OSS score -0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75   to 1.22; p = 0.452). The confidence interval excluded the pre-determined   clinically important difference in the OSS of three points. The   rate of re-t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> was not significantly different between the two groups   (46.4% for arthroscopic and 38.6% for open surgery; 95% CI -6.9   to 25.8; p = 0.256). Healed repairs had the most improved OSS. These   findings were the same when analysed per-protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is no evidence of difference in effectiveness between open   and arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s. The rate of re-t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>   is high in both groups, for all sizes of t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> and ages and this   adversely affects the outcome.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:107–15.</p></sec>

Which factors influence the rate of failure following metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty revision surgery performed for adverse reactions to metal debris?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine the outcomes following revision surgery of metal-on-metal   hip arthroplasties (MoMHA) performed for adverse reactions to metal   debris (ARMD), and to identify factors predictive of re-revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a retrospective observational study using National   Joint Registry (NJR) data on 2535 MoMHAs undergoing revision surgery   for ARMD between 2008 and 2014. The outcomes studied following revision were   intra-operative complications, mortality and re-revision surgery.   Predictors of re-revision were identified using competing-risk regression   modelling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operative complications occurred in 40 revisions (1.6%).   The cumulative five-y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> patient survival rate was 95.9% (95% confidence   intervals (CI) 92.3 to 97.8). Re-revision surgery was performed   in 192 hips (7.6%). The cumulative five-y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> implant survival rate   was 89.5% (95% CI 87.3 to 91.3). Predictors of re-revision were   high body mass index at revision (subhazard ratio (SHR) 1.06 per   kg/m<sup>2 </sup>increase, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09), modular component   only revisions (head and liner with or without taper adapter; SHR   2.01, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.38), ceramic-on-ceramic revision b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ings   (SHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.80), and acetabular bone grafting (SHR   2.10, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.07). These four factors remained predictive   of re-revision when the missing data were imputed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The short-term risk of re-revision following MoMHA revision surgery   performed for ARMD was comparable with that reported in the NJR   following all-cause non-MoMHA revision surgery. However, the factors   predictive of re-revision included those which could be modified   by the surgeon, suggesting that rates of failure following ARMD revision   may be reduced further.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1020–7.</p></sec>

Impact of Left Atrial Appendage Closure During Cardiac Surgery on the Occurrence of Early Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke, and Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prophylactic exclusion of the left atrial appendage (LAA) is often performed during cardiac surgery ostensibly to reduce the risk of stroke. However, the clinical impact of LAA closure in humans remains inconclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Of 10 633 adults who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and valve surgery between January 2000 and December 2005, 9792 patients with complete baseline characteristics, surgery procedure, and follow-up data were included in this analysis. A propensity score–matching analysis based on 28 pretreatment covariates was performed and 461 matching pairs were derived and analyzed to estimate the association of LAA closure with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) (atrial fibrillation ≤30 days of surgery), ischemic stroke, and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the propensity-matched cohort, the overall incidence of POAF was 53.9%. In this group, the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly POAF among the patients who underwent LAA closure was 68.6% versus 31.9% for those who did not undergo the procedure (<i>P</i><0.001). LAA closure was independently associated with an increased risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly POAF (adjusted odds ratio, 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 2.89–5.20), but did not significantly influence the risk of stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.58) or mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–1.13).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>After adjustment for treatment allocation bias, LAA closure during routine cardiac surgery was significantly associated with an increased risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly POAF, but it did not influence the risk of stroke or mortality. It remains uncertain whether prophylactic exclusion of the LAA is warranted for stroke prevention during non–atrial fibrillation-related cardiac surgery.</p></sec>

Point-of-Care Hemostatic Testing in Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac surgery is frequently complicated by coagulopathic bleeding that is difficult to optimally manage using standard hemostatic testing. We hypothesized that point-of-care hemostatic testing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm would improve the management of coagulopathy in cardiac surgery and thereby reduce blood transfusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a pragmatic multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial of a point-of-care–based transfusion algorithm in consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 12 hospitals from October 6, 2014, to May 1, 2015. Following a 1-month data collection at all participating hospitals, a transfusion algorithm incorporating point-of-care hemostatic testing was sequentially implemented at 2 hospitals at a time in 1-month intervals, with the implementation order randomly assigned. No other aspects of care were modified. The primary outcome was red blood cell transfusion from surgery to postoperative day 7. Other outcomes included transfusion of other blood products, major bleeding, and major complications. The analysis adjusted for secular time trends, within-hospital clustering, and patient-level risk factors. All outcomes and analyses were prespecified before study initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 7402 patients studied, 3555 underwent surgery during the control phase and 3847 during the intervention phase. Overall, 3329 (45.0%) received red blood cells, 1863 (25.2%) received platelets, 1645 (22.2%) received plasma, and 394 (5.3%) received cryoprecipitate. Major bleeding occurred in 1773 (24.1%) patients, and major complications occurred in 740 (10.2%) patients. The trial intervention reduced rates of red blood cell transfusion (adjusted relative risk, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.02; number needed to treat, 24.7), platelet transfusion (relative risk, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.87; <i>P</i><0.001; number needed to treat, 16.7), and major bleeding (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.004; number needed to treat, 22.6), but had no effect on other blood product transfusions or major complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of point-of-care hemostatic testing within the context of an integrated transfusion algorithm reduces red blood cell transfusions, platelet transfusions, and major bleeding following cardiac surgery. Our findings support the broader adoption of point-of-care hemostatic testing into clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Does osteofibrous dysplasia progress to adamantinoma and how should they be treated?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify any progression between   benign osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD), OFD-like adamantinoma and malignant   adamantinoma, and to investigate the rates of local recurrence,   metastases and survival, in order to develop treatment algorithms   for each.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single institution retrospective review of all patients presenting   with OFD, OFD-like adamantinoma and adamantinoma between 1973 and   2012 was undertaken. Complete data were available for 73 patients   (42 with OFD; ten with an OFD-like adamantinoma and 21 with an adamantinoma).   The mean follow-up was 10.3 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (3.0   to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at diagnosis for OFD was 13.5 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (1 to 49), 10.5   y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (14 to 86) for adamantinoma.   A total of 24 of the 42 patients with OFD (57%) have not required   any treatment and have been managed with observation. A total of   18 of the 42 patients with OFD underwent surgery, 13 with curettage   and five with resection. In all, three patients developed recurrence   following curettage (23%) but none following resection. All these   patients were cured with further limited surgery. A total of six   patients initially diagnosed with OFD were subsequently found to   have OFD-like adamantinoma. Of the ten patients initially diagnosed   with OFD-like adamantinoma, three (30%) were managed with observation   alone and seven underwent surgery, two with curettage and five with   resection. Local recurrence arose in two patients, one each after   curettage and resection. No patients with either OFD or an OFD-like   adamantinoma developed metastases or had progression to adamantinoma.   All patients with an adamantinoma were treated by surgery, three   with curettage, six with amputation and 12 with excision. In all,   two of the three treated with curettage developed local recurrence, requiring   further surgery. Late development of both local recurrence and metastases   led to a ten y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> disease specific survival of 93% which had dropped   to 39% by 20 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found no evidence of progression from OFD to adamantinoma.   Conservative management with observation or curettage is often successful   for patients with OFD and OFD-like adamantinoma. Resection with   cl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> margins is required for patients with adamantinoma. Late tumour   recurrence is not uncommon in adamantinoma and prolonged follow-up   should be considered.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:409–16.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to retrospectively assess the accuracy and safety of   CT navigated pedicle screws and to compare accuracy in the cervical   and thoracic spine (C2-T8) with (COMB) and without (POST) prior   anterior surgery (anterior cervical discectomy or corpectomy and   fusion with ventral plating: ACDF/ACCF).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 592 pedicle screws, which were used in 107 consecutively   operated patients (210 COMB, 382 POST), were analysed. The accuracy   of positioning was determined according to the classification of   Gertzbein and Robbins on post-operative CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>High accuracy was achieved in 524 screws (88.5%), 192 (87.7%)   in the cervical spine and 332 (89%) in the thoracic spine, respectively.   The results in the two surgical groups were compared and a logistic   regression mixed model was performed to analyse the risk of low   accuracy. Significantly lower accuracy was found in the COMB group   with 82.9% <i>versus</i> 91.6% in the POST group (p =   0.036). There were no neurological complications, but two vertebral artery   lesions were recorded. Three patients underwent revision surgery   for malpositioning of a screw. Although the risk of malpositioning   of a screw after primary anterior surgery was estimated to be 2.4-times   higher than with posterior surgery alone, the overall rates of complication   and revision were low.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We therefore conclude that CT navigated pedicle screws can be   positioned safely although greater caution must be taken in patients   who have previously undergone anterior surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1373–80.</p></sec>

Rates, causes, and costs of 30-day readmissions after noncardiac surgery with and without perioperative AMI were identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3 807 357 hospitalizations for major noncardiac surgery, 8085 patients with perioperative AMI were identified. A total of 1135 patients (14.0%) with perioperative AMI died in-hospital during the index admission. Survivors of perioperative AMI were more likely to be readmitted within 30 days than surgical patients without perioperative AMI (19.1% versus 6.5%, <i>P</i><0.001). The most common indications for 30-day rehospitalization were management of infectious complications (30.0%), cardiovascular complications (25.3%), and bleeding (10.4%). In-hospital mortality during hospital readmission in the first 30 days after perioperative AMI was 11.3%.

Perioperative Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) seems to be a contributor to mortality after noncardiac surgery. Because the vast majority of PMIs are asymptomatic, PMI usually is missed in the absence of systematic screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a prospective diagnostic study enrolling consecutive patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who had a planned postoperative stay of ≥24 hours and were considered at increased cardiovascular risk. All patients received a systematic screening using serial measurements of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T in clinical routine. PMI was defined as an absolute high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T increase of ≥14 ng/L from preoperative to postoperative measurements. Furthermore, mortality was compared among patients with PMI not fulfilling additional criteria (ischemic symptoms, new ECG changes, or imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium) required for the diagnosis of spontaneous acute myocardial infarction versus those that did.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 2014 to 2015 we included 2018 consecutive patients undergoing 2546 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeri</span></strong>es. Patients had a median age of 74 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s and 42% were women. PMI occurred after 397 of 2546 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeri</span></strong>es (16%; 95% confidence interval, 14%–17%) and was accompanied by typical chest pain in 24 of 397 patients (6%) and any ischemic symptoms in 72 of 397 (18%). Crude 30-day mortality was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7–12.0) in patients with PMI versus 1.5% (95% CI, 0.9–2.0) in patients without PMI (<i>P</i><0.001). Multivariable regression analysis showed an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.7 (95% CI, 1.5–4.8) for 30-day mortality. The difference was retained at 1 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> with mortality rates of 22.5% (95% CI, 17.6–27.4) versus 9.3% (95% CI, 7.9–10.7). Thirty-day mortality was comparable among patients with PMI not fulfilling any other of the additional criteria required for spontaneous acute myocardial infarction (280/397, 71%) versus those with at least 1 additional criterion (10.4%; 95% CI, 6.7–15.7, versus 8.7%; 95% CI, 4.2–16.7; <i>P</i>=0.684).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PMI is a common complication after noncardiac surgery and, despite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly detection during routine clinical screening, is associated with substantial short- and long-term mortality.

Weight Loss and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Associations of obesity with incidence of h<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>t failure have been observed, but the causality is uncertain.

All analyses used inverse probability weights based on baseline body mass index and a propensity score estimated from baseline variables. Treatment groups were well balanced in terms of weight, body mass index, and most potential confounders. Associations of treatment with h<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>t failure incidence, as defined in the National Patient Register, were analyzed with Cox regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 25 804 gastric bypass surgery patients had on average lost 18.8 kg more weight after 1 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> and 22.6 kg more after 2 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s than the 13 701 lifestyle modification patients.

Perioperative Dexmedetomidine Improves Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Cardiac surgery is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular and other complications that translate into increased mortality and healthcare costs. This retrospective study was designed to determine whether the perioperative use of dexmedetomidine could reduce the incidence of complications and mortality after cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A total of 1134 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery and coronary artery bypass surgery plus valvular or other procedures were included. Of them, 568 received intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion and 566 did not. Data were adjusted with propensity scores, and multivariate logistic regression was used. The primary outcomes measured included mortality and postoperative major adverse cardiocerebral events (stroke, coma, perioperative myocardial infarction, h<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>t block, or cardiac arrest). Secondary outcomes included renal failure, sepsis, delirium, postoperative ventilation hours, length of hospital stay, and 30-day readmission. Dexmedetomidine use significantly reduced postoperative in-hospital (1.23% versus 4.59%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.192–0.614; <i>P</i><0.0001), 30-day (1.76% versus 5.12%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.226–0.655; <i>P</i><0.0001), and 1-y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> (3.17% versus 7.95%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.312–0.701; <i>P</i>=0.0002) mortality. Perioperative dexmedetomidine therapy also reduced the risk of overall complications (47.18% versus 54.06%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.96; <i>P</i>=0.0136) and delirium (5.46% versus 7.42%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.37–0.75; <i>P</i>=0.0030).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion—</title><p>Perioperative dexmedetomidine use was associated with a decrease in postoperative mortality up to 1 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> and decreased incidence of postoperative complications and delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration—</title><p>URL: <ext-link>www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Acute Aortic Dissection Determines the Fate of Initially Untreated Aortic Segments in Marfan Syndrome
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The aim of the current study was to investigate incidence and causes of surgical interventions in primarily nontreated aortic segments after previous aortic repair in patients with Marfan syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Retrospective analysis of 86 consecutive Marfan syndrome patients fulfilling Ghent criteria that underwent 136 aortic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surgeri</span></strong>es and were followed at this institution in the past 15 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s. Mean follow-up was 8.8±6.8 y. Thirty-day, 6-month, 1-y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>, and overall mortality was 3.5%, 5.8%, 7.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. Ninety-two percent of patients initially presented with aortic root, ascending aortic or arch lesions, whereas 8% presented with descending aortic or thoraco-abdominal lesions. Primary presentation was acute aortic dissection (AAD) in 36% (77% type A, 23% type B) and aneurismal disease in 64%. Secondary complete arch replacement had to be performed in only 6% of patients without AAD, but in 36% with AAD (<i>P</i>=0.0005). In patients without AAD, 11% required surgery on primarily nontreated aortic segments (5 of 6 patients experienced type B dissection during follow-up), whereas in patients after AAD, 48% underwent surgery of initially nontreated aortic segments (42% of patients with type A and 86% of those with type B dissection; <i>P</i>=0.0002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The need for surgery in primarily nontreated aortic segments is precipitated by an initial presentation with AAD. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly elective surgery is associated with low mortality and reintervention rates.

Discharge on the day of surgery following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty within the United Kingdom NHS
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been successfully   performed in the United States healthcare system on outpatients.   Despite differences in healthcare structure and financial environment,   we hypothesised that it would be feasible to replicate this success   and perform UKA with safe day of surgery discharge within the NHS,   in the United Kingdom. This has not been reported in any other United   Kingdom centres.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We report our experience of implementing a pathway to allow safe   day of surgery discharge following UKA. Data were prospectively   collected on 72 patients who underwent UKA as a day case between   December 2011 and September 2015. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 61 patients (85%) were discharged on the same day.   The most common reason for failure was logistical; five patients   had their operation too late in the day. Three patients failed to   mobilise safely, two had inadequate control of pain and one had   a leaking wound. The mean length of stay for those who were not   discharged on the same day was 1.2 nights (1 to 3). During the same   time, 58 patients underwent planned inpatient UKA, as they were deemed   inappropriate for discharge on the day of surgery. However, three   of these were safely discharged on the same day.</p><p>Follow-up data, 24 hours post-operatively, were available for   70 patients; 51 (73%) reported no or mild pain, 14 (20%) had moderate   pain and five (7%) had severe pain. There were no re-admissions.   All patients had a high level of satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that patients can be safely and effectively discharged   on the day of surgery after UKA, with high levels of satisfaction.

The outcome of the surgical treatment of pelvic chondrosarcomas
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few studies dealing with chondrosarcoma of the pelvis are currently   available. Different data about the overall survival and prognostic   factors have been published but without a detailed analysis of surgery-related complications.   We aimed to analyse the outcome of a series of pelvic chondrosarcomas   treated at a single institution, with particular attention to the   prognostic factors. Based on a competing risk model, our objective   was to identify risk factors for the development of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective single-centre study, 58 chondrosarcomas (26   patients alive, 32 patients dead) of the pelvis were reviewed. The   mean follow-up was 13 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (one week to 23.1 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 26 patients (45%) were alive and 32 patients (55%)   had died. Overall survival was 76%, 55% and 45% at one, five and   ten y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s post-operatively, respectively. In a competing risk model   the cumulative risk of the development of a surgery-related complication   was 64% at six months and 69% at one y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>, post-operatively, respectively.   Endoprosthetic reconstruction was a significant risk factor for   the development of complications (p = 0.006). Complications were   not significantly related to age or the location or grade of the   tumour (p = 0.823, p = 0.976, p = 0.858). The development of complications   did not have a negative effect on survival (p = 0.147).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study with competing risk analysis of surgery-related   complications in patients with a pelvic chondrosarcoma. The surgery   in these patients remains prone to complications. Endoprosthetic   reconstruction significantly increases the risk of the development   of complications (p = 0.006). A competing risk model showed that   the development of complications does not have a negative influence   on overall survival (p = 0.147). An aggressive, surgical resection   with the goal of achieving wide margins whenever possible remains   the mainstay of treatment. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:686–96.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term clinical   and radiological outcome of patients who suffer recurrent injuries   to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) after reconstruction and   require revision surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>From a consecutive series of 200 patients who underwent primary   reconstruction following rupture of the ACL, we identified 36 who   sustained a further rupture, 29 of whom underwent revision surgery.   Patients were reviewed prospectively at one, two, seven, 15 and   about 20 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s after their original surgery.

Fate map of the chicken otic placode
<p>The inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> is an intricate three-dimensional sensory organ that arises from a flat, thickened portion of the ectoderm termed the otic placode. There is evidence that the ontogenetic steps involved in the progressive specification of the highly specialized inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> of vertebrates involve the concerted actions of diverse patterning signals that originate from n<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>by tissues, providing positional identity and instructive context. The topology of the prospective inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> portions at placode stages when such patterning begins has remained largely unknown. The chick-quail model was used to perform a comprehensive fate mapping study of the chick otic placode, shedding light on the precise topological position of each presumptive inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> component relative to the dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes of the otic placode and, implicitly, to the possible sources of inducing signals. The findings reveal the existence of three dorsoventrally arranged anteroposterior domains from which the endolymphatic system, the maculae and basilar papilla, and the cristae develop. This study provides new bases for the interpretation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>lier and future descriptive and experimental studies that aim to understand the molecular genetic mechanisms involved in otic placode patterning.</p>

Body Mass Index and Mortality Among Adults Undergoing Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In an apparent paradox, morbidity and mortality are lower in obese patients undergoing cardiac surgery, although the nature of this association is uncl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>. We sought to determine whether the obesity paradox observed in cardiac surgery is attributable to reverse epidemiology, bias, or confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the National Adult Cardiac Surgery registry for all cardiac surgical procedures performed between April 2002 and March 2013 were extracted. A parallel systematic review and meta-analysis (MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library) through June 2015 were also accomplished. Exposure of interest was body mass index categorized into 6 groups according to the World Health Organization classification.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 401 227 adult patients in the cohort study and 557 720 patients in the systematic review were included. A U-shaped association between mortality and body mass index classes was observed in both studies, with lower mortality in overweight (adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.83) and obese class I and II (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.86; and odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.94) patients relative to normal-weight patients and increased mortality in underweight individuals (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.41–1.62). In the cohort study, a U-shaped relationship was observed for stroke and low cardiac output syndrome but not for renal replacement therapy or deep sternal wound infection. Counter to the reverse epidemiology hypotheses, the protective effects of obesity were less in patients with severe chronic renal, lung, or cardiac disease and greater in older patients and in those with complications of obesity, including the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. Adjustments for important confounders did not alter our results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Obesity is associated with lower risks after cardiac surgery, with consistent effects noted in multiple analyses attempting to address residual confounding and reverse causation.</p></sec>

Repeat Coronary Revascularization After Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>A major advantage of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) relative to percutaneous coronary intervention is its durability, yet there is a paucity of information on rates and predictors of repeat coronary revascularization after CABG in the modern era.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We included patients ≥65 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons’ National Adult Cardiac Surgery Database who were undergoing first-time isolated CABG from 1991 to 2007 (n=723 134, median age 73 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s). After linking to Medicare claims data, long-term outcomes of CABG (up to 18 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s after surgery) were examined by use of cumulative incidence curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to identify factors associated with 1- and 5-y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> repeat revascularization trends and variability. We found that the overall 18-y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> survival rate was 20%. Cumulative incidences of any repeat revascularization (percutaneous coronary intervention or CABG, yet most often percutaneous coronary intervention) were 2%, 7%, 13%, and 16% at 1, 5, 10, and 18 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s after surgery, respectively. The rates of repeat CABG procedures were quite low for all time points (0.1%, 0.6%, 1.3%, and 1.7%, respectively). Female sex, disease severity represented by a history of percutaneous coronary intervention, preoperative dialysis, and partial revascularization were strongly associated with a higher revascularization rate, whereas advanced age, left main disease, and smoking were associated with a lower rate. There was approximately a 2-fold variation in repeat revascularization rates across centers at 1 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> (interquartile range 1.7–3.6%) and 5 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (interquartile range 6.7–12.0%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Repeat revascularization is performed infrequently among older patients who undergo CABG; however, these rates vary substantially by patient subgroups and among providers.</p></sec>

Computer hexapod-assisted orthopaedic surgery provides a predictable and safe method of femoral deformity correction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Computer hexapod assisted orthopaedic surgery (CHAOS), is a method   to achieve the intra-operative correction of long bone deformities   using a hexapod external fixator before definitive internal fixation   with minimally invasive stabilisation techniques.</p><p>The aims of this study were to determine the reliability of this   method in a consecutive case series of patients undergoing femoral   deformity correction, with a minimum six-month follow-up, to assess   the complications and to define the ideal group of patients for   whom this treatment is appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The medical records and radiographs of all patients who underwent   CHAOS for femoral deformity at our institution between 2005 and   2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Records were available for all   55 consecutive procedures undertaken in 49 patients with a mean   age of 35.6 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (10.9 to 75.3) at the time of surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients were assessed at a mean interval of 44 months (6 to   90) following surgery. The indications were broad; the most common   were vitamin D resistant rickets (n = 10), growth plate arrest (n   = 6) and post-traumatic deformity (n = 20).</p><p>Multi-planar correction was required in 33 cases. A single level   osteotomy was performed in 43 cases. Locking plates were used to   stabilise the osteotomy in 33 cases and intramedullary nails in   the remainder.

Is computer navigation when used in the surgery of iliosacral pelvic bone tumours safer for the patient?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Due to the complex anatomy of the pelvis, limb-sparing resections   of pelvic tumours achieving adequate surgical margins, can often   be difficult. The advent of computer navigation has improved the   precision of resection of these lesions, though there is little   evidence comparing resection with or without the assistance of navigation.</p><p>Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of navigation-assisted surgery   for the resection of pelvic bone tumours involving the posterior   ilium and sacrum. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using our prospectively updated institutional database, we conducted   a retrospective case control study of 21 patients who underwent   resection of the posterior ilium and sacrum, for the treatment of   a primary sarcoma of bone, between 1987 and 2015. The resection   was performed with the assistance of navigation in nine patients   and without navigation in 12. We assessed the accuracy of navigation-assisted   surgery, as defined by the surgical margin and how this affects   the rate of local recurrence, the disease-free survival and the   effects on peri-and post-operative morbidity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the patients was 36.4 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (15 to 66). The mean   size of the tumour was 10.9 cm. In the navigation-assisted group,   the margin was wide in two patients (16.7%), marginal in six (66.7%)   and wide-contaminated in one (11.1%) with no intralesional margin.   In the non-navigated-assisted group; the margin was wide in two   patients (16.7%), marginal in five (41.7%), intralesional in three   (25.0%) and wide-contaminated in two (16.7%). Local recurrence occurred   in two patients in the navigation-assisted group (22.2%) and six   in the non-navigation-assisted group (50.0%). The disease-free survival   was significantly better when operated with navigation-assistance   (p = 0.048). The blood loss and operating time were less in the   navigated-assisted group, as was the risk of a foot drop post-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>The introduction of navigation-assisted surgery for the resection   of tumours of the posterior ilium and sacrum has increased the safety   for the patients and allows for a better oncological outcome. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:261–6.</p></sec>

The impact of lifestyle risk factors on the rate of infection after surgery for a fracture of the ankle
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Lifestyle risk factors are thought to increase the risk of infection   after acute orthopaedic surgery but the evidence is scarce. We aimed   to investigate whether smoking, obesity and alcohol overuse are   risk factors for the development of infections after surgery for   a fracture of the ankle.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent internal   fixation of a fracture of the ankle between 2008 and 2013. The primary   outcome was the rate of deep infection and the secondary outcome   was any surgical site infection (SSI). Associations with the risk   factors and possible confounding variables were analysed univariably   and multivariably with backwards elimination.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1043 patients were included; 64 (6.1%) had a deep   infection and 146 (14.0%) had SSI. Obesity was strongly associated   with both outcomes (odds ratio (OR) 2.21, p = 0.017 and OR 1.68,   p = 0.032) in all analyses. Alcohol overuse was similarly associated,   though significant only in unadjusted analyses. Surprisingly, smoking   did not yield statistically significant associations with infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that obesity and possibly alcohol overuse   are independent risk factors for the development of infection following   surgery for a fracture of the ankle.

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term neurological outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for neurological deterioration, or deformity   correction in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological deterioration at a mean of 26 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   deterioration were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without neurological deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological deterioration after 42 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s to 75 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s following the initial drug treatment.   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly onset kyphosis might relate to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly death.

Revision total knee arthroplasty for failed high tibial osteotomy and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty have similar patient-reported outcome measures in a two-year follow-up study
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about the relative outcomes of revision of unicompartmental   knee arthroplasty (UKA) and high tibial osteotomy (HTO) to total   knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study is to compare the   outcomes of revision surgery for the two procedures in terms of   complications, re-revision and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)   at a minimum of two y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This study was a retrospective review of data from an institutional   arthroplasty registry for cases performed between 2001 and 2014.   A total of 292 patients were identified, of which 217 had a revision   of HTO to TKA, and 75 had revision of UKA to TKA. While mean follow-up   was longer for the HTO group compared with the UKA group, patient   demographics (age, body mass index and Charlson co-morbidity index)   and PROMs (Short Form-36, Oxford Knee Score, Knee Society Score,   both objective and functional) were similar in the two groups prior   to revision surgery. Outcomes included the rate of complications   and    re-operation, PROMS and patient-reported satisfaction at six months   and two y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s post-operatively. We also compared the duration of   surgery and the need for revision implants in the two groups. </p></sec><sec><title>Results </title><p>At two-y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> follow-up, both groups of patients had made significant   improvement in terms of PROMs compared with pre-operative scores.

Is limb salvage surgery safe for bone sarcomas identified after a previous surgical procedure?
<p>Bone sarcomas are rare cancers and orthopaedic   surgeons come across them infrequently, sometimes unexpectedly during   surgical procedures. We investigated the outcomes of patients who   underwent a surgical procedure where sarcomas were found unexpectedly   and were subsequently referred to our unit for treatment. We identified   95 patients (44 intra-lesional excisions, 35 fracture fixations,   16 joint replacements) with mean age of 48 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (11 to 83); 60%   were males (n = 57). Local recurrence arose in 40% who underwent   limb salvage surgery <i>versus</i> 12% who had an amputation.   Despite achieving local control, overall survival was worse for   patients treated with amputation rather than limb salvage (54% <i>vs</i> 75%   five-y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> survival). Factors that negatively influenced survival   were invasive primary surgery (fracture fixation, joint replacement),   a delay of greater than two months until referral to our oncology   service, and high-grade tumours. Survival in these circumstances   depends mostly on factors that are determined prior to definitive   treatment by a tertiary orthopaedic oncology unit. Limb salvage   in this group of patients is associated with a higher rate of inadequate   marginal surgery and, consequently, higher local recurrence rates   than amputation, but should still be attempted whenever possible,   as local control is not the primary determinant of survival. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:665–72.</p>

Development
Zebrafish Foxi1 provides a neuronal ground state during inner ear induction preceding the Dlx3b/4b-regulated sensory lineage
<p>Vertebrate inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> development is a complex process that involves the induction of a common territory for otic and epibranchial precursors and their subsequent segregation into otic and epibranchial cell fates. In zebrafish, the otic-epibranchial progenitor domain (OEPD) is induced by Fgf signaling in a Foxi1- and Dlx3b/4b-dependent manner, but the functional differences of Foxi1 and Dlx3b/4b in subsequent cell fate specifications within the developing inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> are poorly understood. Based on pioneer tracking (PioTrack), a novel Cre-dependent genetic lineage tracing method, and genetic data, we show that the competence to embark on a neuronal or sensory fate is provided sequentially and very <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly during otic placode induction. Loss of Foxi1 prevents neuronal precursor formation without affecting hair cell specification, whereas loss of Dlx3b/4b inhibits hair cell but not neuronal precursor formation. Consistently, in Dlx3b/4b- and Sox9a-deficient <i>b380</i> mutants almost all otic epithelial fates are absent, including sensory hair cells, and the remaining otic cells adopt a neuronal fate. Furthermore, the progenitors of the anterior lateral line ganglia also arise from the OEPD in a Foxi1-dependent manner but are unaffected in the absence of Dlx3b/4b or in <i>b380</i> mutants. Thus, in addition to otic fate Foxi1 provides neuronal competence during OEPD induction prior to and independently of the Dlx3b/4b-mediated sensory fate of the developing inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>.</p>

Duct Stenting Versus Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt in Neonates With Duct-Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Infants born with cardiac abnormalities causing dependence on the arterial duct for pulmonary blood flow are often palliated with a shunt usually between the subclavian artery and either pulmonary artery. A so-called modified Blalock-Taussig shunt allows progress through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly life to an age and weight at which repair or further more stable palliation can be safely achieved. Modified Blalock-Taussig shunts continue to present concern for postprocedural instability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly mortality such that other alternatives continue to be explored. Duct stenting (DS) is emerging as one such alternative with potential for greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly stability and improved survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The purpose of this study was to compare postprocedural outcomes and survival to next-stage palliative or reparative surgery between patients undergoing a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS in infants with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow. All patients undergoing cardiac surgery and congenital interventions in the United Kingdom are prospectively recruited to an externally validated national outcome audit. From this audit, participating UK centers identified infants <30 days of age undergoing either a Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS for cardiac conditions with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow between January 2012 and December 31, 2015. One hundred seventy-one patients underwent a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, and in 83 patients, DS was attempted. Primary and secondary outcomes of survival and need for extracorporeal support were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Longer-term mortality before repair and reintervention were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression. All multivariable analyses accommodated a propensity score to balance patient characteristics between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There was an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly (to discharge) survival advantage for infants before next-stage surgery in the DS group (odds ratio, 4.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.37–13.14; <i>P</i>=0.012). There was also a difference in the need for postprocedural extracorporeal support in favor of the DS group (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.058). Longer-term survival outcomes showed a reduced risk of death before repair in the DS group (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.07–0.85; <i>P</i>=0.026) but a slightly increased risk of reintervention (hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–2.64; <i>P</i>=0.165).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>DS is emerging as a preferred alternative to a surgical shunt for neonatal palliation with evidence for greater postprocedural stability and improved patient survival to destination surgical treatment.</p></sec>

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is uncl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) target for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between diffusion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included diffusion-weighted imaging–evaluated total number of new ischemic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s in the low-target group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s in the high-target group (n=98). Procedural risk scores were comparable between groups. Overall, diffusion-weighted imaging revealed new cerebral lesions in 52.8% of patients in the low-target group versus 55.7% in the high-target group (<i>P</i>=0.76). The primary outcome of volume of new cerebral lesions was comparable between groups, 25 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–118 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–25 261 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the low-target group versus 29 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–143 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–22 116 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the high-target group (median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, −25 to 0.028; <i>P</i>=0.99), as was the secondary outcome of number of new lesions (1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–24] versus 1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–29] respectively; median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, 0–0; <i>P</i>=0.71).

Reduction of ≥30% of the total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining controlled blood pressure occurred in 41 of 49 patients from the gastric bypass group (83.7%) compared with 6 of 47 patients (12.8%) from the control group with a rate ratio of 6.6 (95% confidence interval, 3.1–14.0; <i>P</i><0.001). Remission of hypertension was present in 25 of 49 (51%) and 22 of 48 (45.8%) patients randomized to gastric bypass, considering office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, respectively, whereas no patient submitted to medical therapy was free of antihypertensive drugs at 12 months.

Low-Dose Aspirin Discontinuation and Risk of Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>There are increasing concerns about risks associated with aspirin discontinuation in the absence of major surgery or bleeding.

Cardiovascular and Ventilatory Consequences of Laparoscopic Surgery
<p>Although laparoscopic surgery accounts for >2 million surgical procedures every y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>, the current preoperative risk scores and guidelines do not adequately assess the risks of laparoscopy. In general, laparoscopic procedures have a lower risk of morbidity and mortality compared with operations requiring a midline laparotomy. During laparoscopic surgery, carbon dioxide insufflation may produce significant hemodynamic and ventilatory consequences such as increased intraabdominal pressure and hypercarbia. Hemodynamic insults secondary to increased intraabdominal pressure include increased afterload and preload and decreased cardiac output, whereas ventilatory consequences include increased airway pressures, hypercarbia, and decreased pulmonary compliance. Hemodynamic effects are accentuated in patients with cardiovascular disease such as congestive h<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>t failure, ischemic h<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>t disease, valvular h<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>t disease, pulmonary hypertension, and congenital h<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>t disease. Prevention of cardiovascular complications may be accomplished through a sound understanding of the hemodynamic and physiological consequences of laparoscopic surgery as well as a defined operative plan generated by a multidisciplinary team involving the preoperative consultant, anesthesiologist, and surgeon.</p>

Right Ventricular Systolic Function in Organic Mitral Regurgitation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>To assess the prevalence, determinants, and prognosis value of right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (EF) impairment in organic mitral regurgitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Two hundred eight patients (62±12 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s, 138 males) with chronic organic mitral regurgitation referred to surgery underwent an echocardiography and biventricular radionuclide angiography with regional function assessment. Mean RV EF was 40.4±10.2%, ranging from 10% to 65%. RV EF was severely impaired (≤35%) in 63 patients (30%), and biventricular impairment (left ventricular EF<60% and RV EF≤35%) was found in 34 patients (16%). Pathophysiologic correlates of RV EF were left ventricular septal function (β=0.42, <i>P</i><0.0001), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter index (β=−0.22, <i>P</i>=0.002), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (β=−0.14, <i>P</i>=0.047). Mitral effective regurgitant orifice size (n=84) influenced RV EF (β=−0.28, <i>P</i>=0.012). In 68 patients examined after surgery, RV EF increased strongly (27.5±4.3–37.9±7.3, <i>P</i><0.0001) in patients with depressed RV EF, whereas it did not change in others (<i>P</i>=0.91). RV EF ≤35% impaired 10-y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> cardiovascular survival (71.6±8.4% versus 89.8±3.7%, <i>P</i>=0.037). Biventricular impairment dramatically reduced 10-y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> cardiovascular survival (51.9±15.3% versus 90.3±3.2%, <i>P</i><0.0001; hazard ratio, 5.2; <i>P</i><0.0001) even after adjustment for known predictors (hazard ratio, 4.6; <i>P</i>=0.004). Biventricular impairment reduced also 10-y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> overall survival (34.8±13.0% versus 72.6±4.5%, <i>P</i>=0.003; hazard ratio, 2.5; <i>P</i>=0.005) even after adjustment for known predictors (<i>P</i>=0.048).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>In patients with organic mitral regurgitation referred to surgery, RV function impairment is frequent (30%) and depends weakly on pulmonary artery systolic pressure but mainly on left ventricular remodeling and septal function. RV function is a predictor of postoperative cardiovascular survival, whereas biventricular impairment is a powerful predictor of both cardiovascular and overall survival.</p></sec>

Instability of the hip after anatomical  re-alignment in patients with a slipped capital femoral epiphysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Several studies have reported the safety and efficacy of subcapital   re-alignment for patients with slipped capital femoral epiphysis   (SCFE) using surgical dislocation of the hip and an extended retinacular   flap. Instability of the hip and dislocation as a consequence of   this surgery has only recently gained attention. We discuss this   problem with some illustrative cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We explored the literature on the possible pathophysiological   causes and surgical steps associated with the risk of post-operative   instability and articular damage. In addition, we describe supplementary   steps that could be used to avoid these problems.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The causes of instability may be divided into three main groups:   the first includes causes directly related to SCFE (acetabular labral   damage, severe abrasion of the acetabular cartilage, flattening   of the acetabular roof and a bell-shaped deformity of the epiphysis);   the second, causes not related to the SCFE (acetabular orientation   and poor quality of the soft tissues); the third, causes directly   related to the surgery (capsulotomy, division of the ligamentum teres,   shortening of the femoral neck, pelvi-trochanteric impingement,   previous proximal femoral osteotomy and post-operative positioning   of the leg).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present examples drawn from our clinical practice, as well   as possible ways of reducing the risks of these complications, and   of correcting them if they happen.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:16–21.</p></sec>

The impact of age on major orthopaedic trauma
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To compare the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly management and mortality of older patients   sustaining major orthopaedic trauma with that of a younger population   with similar injuries.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The Trauma Audit Res<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ch Network database was reviewed to identify   eligible patients admitted between April 2012 and June 2015.

The population was divided   into young (64 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s or younger) and older (65 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s and older) patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 142 765 adults sustaining major trauma, 72 942 (51.09 %) had   long bone or pelvic fractures and 45.81% of these were > 65 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s   old. Road traffic collision was the most common mechanism in the   young (40.4%) and, in older people, fall from standing height (80.4%)   predominated. The 30 day mortality in older patients with fractures   is greater (6.8% <i>versus</i> 2.5%), although critical   care episodes are more common in the young (18.2% <i>versus</i> 9.7%).

Complications following arthroscopic surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery of the   hip has increased significantly during the past decade. It has now   become an established technique for the treatment of many intra-   and extra-articular conditions affecting the hip. However, it has   a steep l<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ning curve and is not without the risk of complications.   The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence   of complications during and following this procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines were used in designing this study. Two reviewers systematically   s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ched the literature for complications related to arthroscopy   of the hip. The res<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ch question and eligibility criteria were   established <i>a priori</i>. Pertinent data were abstracted   and analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found 276 relevant studies with a total of 36 761 arthroscopies   that met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was   36.7 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (1.7 to 70) and the mean body mass index was 25.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (20.2   to 29.2). Femoroacetabular impingement and labral t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s were the   most common indications for the procedure. The total number of complications   was 1222 (3.3%). Nerve injury (0.9%), mainly involving the pudendal   and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves, and iatrogenic chondral and   labral injury (0.7%), were the two most common complications.

Long-term outcome of carpal tunnel release surgery in patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few studies have examined the long-term outcome of carpal tunnel   release (CTR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient-reported   long-term outcome of CTR for electrophysiologically severe carpal   tunnel syndrome (CTS).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed the long-term outcome of 40 patients with bilateral   severe CTS who underwent 80 CTRs (46 open, 34 endoscopic) between   2002 and 2012. The outcomes studied were patient-reported outcomes   of numbness resolution, the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ)   score, and patient satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 9.3 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s. Complete resolution of numbness   was reported by 93.8% of patients, persistent numbness by 3.8%,   and recurrent numbness by 2.5%. The mean BCTQ symptom score was   1.1 (<sc>sd</sc> 0.3; 1.0 to 2.55) and the mean Boston function   score was 1.15 (<sc>sd</sc> 0.46; 1.0 to 3.5). 72.5% of patients   were asymptomatic and had no functional impairment.

What is the morbidity of a non-invasive growing prosthesis?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Extendible endoprostheses have been available for more than 30   y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s and have become more sophisticated with time. The latest generation   is ‘non-invasive’ and can be lengthened with an external magnetic   force. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly results have shown a worryingly high rate of complications   such as infection. This study investigates the incidence of complications   and the need for further surgery in a cohort of patients with a   non-invasive growing endoprosthesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2003 and June 2014, 50 children (51 prostheses) had a   non-invasive growing prosthesis implanted for a primary bone sarcoma.   The minimum follow-up was 24 months for those who survived. Their   mean age was 10.4 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (6 to 14). The incidence of complications   and further surgery was documented.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 64 months (20 to 145). The overall survivorship   of the patients was 84% at three y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s and 70% at five y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s. Revision-free   survival was 81.7% at three y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s and 61.6% at five y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s with competing   risk analysis. Deep infection occurred in 19.6% of implants at a   mean of 12.5 months (0 to 55). Other complications were a failure   of the lengthening mechanism in five prostheses (9.8%) and breakage   of the implant in two (3.9%). Overall, there were 53 additional   operations (0 to 5 per patient). A total of seven patients (14%)   underwent amputation, three for local recurrence and four for infection.   Their mean limb length discrepancy was 4.3 mm (0 to 25) and mean Musculoskeletal   Tumor Society Score functional score was 26.5 (18 to 30) at the   final follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>When compared with previously published <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>ly results, this mid-term   series has shown continued good functional outcomes and compensation   for leg-length discrepancy.

Proximal femoral resection without post-operative traction for the painful dislocated hip in young patients with cerebral palsy
<p>Proximal femoral resection (PFR) is a proven   pain-relieving procedure for the management of patients with severe cerebral   palsy and a painful displaced hip. Previous authors have recommended   post-operative traction or immobilisation to prevent a recurrence   of pain due to proximal migration of the femoral stump. We present   a series of 79 PFRs in 63 patients, age 14.7 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (10 to 26; 35   male, 28 female), none of whom had post-operative traction or immobilisation.</p><p>A total of 71 hips (89.6%) were reported to be pain free or to   have mild pain following surgery. Four children underwent further   resection for persistent pain; of these, three had successful resolution   of pain and one had no benefit. A total of 16 hips (20.2%) showed   radiographic evidence of heterotopic ossification, all of which   had formed within one y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> of surgery. Four patients had a wound   infection, one of which needed debridement; all recovered fully.   A total of 59 patients (94%) reported improvements in seating and   hygiene.</p><p>The results are as good as or better than the historical results   of using traction or immobilisation. We recommend that following   PFR, children can be managed without traction or immobilisation,   and can be discharged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>lier and with fewer complications. However,   care should be taken with severely dystonic patients, in whom more   extensive femoral resection should be considered in combination   with management of the increased tone.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:701–6.</p>

The Targon Femoral Neck hip screw <i>versus</i> cannulated screws for internal fixation of intracapsular fractures of the hip
<p>We compared a new fixation system, the Targon   Femoral Neck (TFN) hip screw, with the current standard treatment of   cannulated screw fixation. This was a single-centre, participant-blinded,   randomised controlled trial. Patients aged 65 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s and over with   either a displaced or undisplaced intracapsular fracture of the   hip were eligible. The primary outcome was the risk of revision   surgery within one y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> of fixation.</p><p>A total of 174 participants were included in the trial. The absolute   reduction in risk of revision was of 4.7% (95% CI 14.2 to 22.5)   in favour of the TFN hip screw (chi-squared test, p = 0.741), which   was less than the pre-specified level of minimum clinically important   difference. There were no significant differences in any of the   secondary outcome measures.</p><p>We found no evidence of a clinical difference in the risk of   revision surgery between the TFN hip screw and cannulated screw   fixation for patients with an intracapsular fracture of the hip.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:652–7.</p>

A prospective study of the incidence and outcomes of incidental dural tears in microendoscopic lumbar decompressive surgery
<p>Little information is available about the incidence   and outcome of incidental dural t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s associated with microendoscopic   lumbar decompressive surgery. We prospectively examined the incidence   of dural t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s and their influence on the outcome six months post-operatively   in 555 consecutive patients (mean age 47.4 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (13 to 89)) who   underwent this form of surgery. The incidence of dural t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s was   5.05% (28/555). The risk factors were the age of the patient and   the procedure of bilateral decompression via a unilateral approach.   The rate of recovery of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score   in patients with dural t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s was significantly lower than that in   those without a t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> (77.7% <i>vs</i> 87.6%; p < 0.02),   although there were no significant differences in the improvement   of the Oswestry Disability Index between the two groups. Most dural   t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s were small, managed by taking adequate care of symptoms of   low cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and did not require direct dural   repair. Routine MRI scans were undertaken six months post-operatively;   four patients with a dural t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> had recurrent or residual disc herniation   and two had further stenosis, possibly because the dural t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> prevented   adequate decompression and removal of the fragments of disc during   surgery; as yet, none of these patients have undergone further surgery. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:641–5.</p>

Functional outcome and alignment in computer-assisted and conventionally operated total knee replacements
<p>We performed a randomised controlled trial comparing   computer-assisted surgery (CAS) with conventional surgery (CONV)   in total knee replacement (TKR). Between 2009 and 2011 a total of   192 patients with a mean age of 68 y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong>s (55 to 85) with osteoarthritis   or arthritic disease of the knee were recruited from four Norwegian   hospitals. At three months follow-up, functional results were marginally   better for the CAS group. Mean differences (MD) in favour of CAS   were found for the Knee Society function score (MD: 5.9, 95% confidence   interval (CI) 0.3 to 11.4, p = 0.039), the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis   Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales for ‘pain’ (MD: 7.7, 95% CI 1.7 to   13.6, p = 0.012), ‘sports’ (MD: 13.5, 95% CI 5.6 to 21.4, p = 0.001)   and ‘quality of life’ (MD: 7.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 14.3, p = 0.046).   At one-y<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ear</span></strong> follow-up, differences favouring CAS were found for   KOOS ‘sports’ (MD: 11.0, 95% CI 3.0 to 19.0, p = 0.007) and KOOS   ‘symptoms’ (MD: 6.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 13.0, p = 0.035). The use of   CAS resulted in fewer outliers in frontal alignment (> 3° malalignment),   both for the entire TKR (37.9% <i>vs</i> 17.9%, p = 0.042)   and for the tibial component separately (28.4% <i>vs</i> 6.3%,   p = 0.002). Tibial slope was better achieved with CAS (58.9% <i>vs</i> 26.3%,   p < 0.001). Operation time was 20 minutes longer with CAS. In   conclusion, functional results were, statistically, marginally in favour   of CAS. Also, CAS was more predictable than CONV for mechanical   alignment and positioning of the prosthesis. However, the long-term   outcomes must be further investigated.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:609–18.</p>

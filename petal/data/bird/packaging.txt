The Evolution of Silicon Transport in Eukaryotes
<p>Biosilicification (the formation of biological structures from silica) occurs in diverse eukaryotic lineages, plays a major role in global biogeochemical cycles, and has significant biotechnological applications. Silicon (Si) uptake is crucial for biosilicification, yet the evolutionary history of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers involved remains poorly known. Recent evidence suggests that the SIT family of Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers, initially identified in diatoms, may be widely distributed, with an extended family of related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers (SIT-Ls) present in some nonsilicified organisms. Here, we identify SITs and SIT-Ls in a range of eukaryotes, including major silicified lineages (radiolarians and chrysophytes) and also bacterial SIT-Ls. Our evidence suggests that the symmetrical 10-transmembrane-domain SIT structure has independently evolved multiple times via duplication and fusion of 5-transmembrane-domain SIT-Ls. We also identify a second gene family, similar to the active Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er Lsi2, that is broadly distributed amongst siliceous and nonsiliceous eukaryotes. Our analyses resolve a distinct group of Lsi2-like genes, including plant and diatom Si-responsive genes, and sequences unique to siliceous sponges and choanoflagellates. The SIT/SIT-L and Lsi2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er families likely contribute to biosilicification in diverse lineages, indicating an ancient role for Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in eukaryotes. We propose that these Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers may have arisen initially to prevent Si toxicity in the high Si Precambrian oceans, with subsequent biologically induced reductions in Si concentrations of Phanerozoic seas leading to widespread losses of SIT, SIT-L, and Lsi2-like genes in diverse lineages. Thus, the origin and diversification of two independent Si <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er families both drove and were driven by ancient ocean Si levels.</p>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision   arthroplasty surgery.

Inhibition of Endothelial Notch Signaling Impairs Fatty Acid Transport and Leads to Metabolic and Vascular Remodeling of the Adult Heart
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nutrients are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed through endothelial cells before being metabolized in muscle cells. However, little is known about the regulation of endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> processes. Notch signaling is a critical regulator of metabolism and angiogenesis during development. Here, we studied how genetic and pharmacological manipulation of endothelial Notch signaling in adult mice affects endothelial fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, cardiac angiogenesis, and heart function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial-specific Notch inhibition was achieved by conditional genetic inactivation of Rbp-jκ in adult mice to analyze fatty acid metabolism and heart function. Wild-type mice were treated with neutralizing antibodies against the Notch ligand Delta-like 4. Fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> was studied in cultured endothelial cells and transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Treatment of wild-type mice with Delta-like 4 neutralizing antibodies for 8 weeks impaired fractional shortening and ejection fraction in the majority of mice. Inhibition of Notch signaling specifically in the endothelium of adult mice by genetic ablation of Rbp-jκ caused heart hypertrophy and failure. Impaired heart function was preceded by alterations in fatty acid metabolism and an increase in cardiac blood vessel density. Endothelial Notch signaling controlled the expression of endothelial lipase, Angptl4, CD36, and Fabp4, which are all needed for fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> across the vessel wall. In endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–mutant mice, lipase activity and transendothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of long-chain fatty acids to muscle cells were impaired. In turn, lipids accumulated in the plasma and liver. The attenuated supply of cardiomyocytes with long-chain fatty acids was accompanied by higher glucose uptake, increased concentration of glycolysis intermediates, and mTOR-S6K signaling. Treatment with the mTOR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> rapamycin or displacing glucose as cardiac substrate by feeding a ketogenic diet prolonged the survival of endothelial-specific Rbp-jκ–deficient mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study identifies Notch signaling as a novel regulator of fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> across the endothelium and as an essential repressor of angiogenesis in the adult heart. The data imply that the endothelium controls cardiomyocyte metabolism and function.</p></sec>

A unique type of GSK-3 inhibitor brings new opportunities to the clinic
<p>Development of protein kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s is a focus of many drug discovery programs. A major problem, however, is the limited specificity of the commonly used adenosine triphosphate–competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s and the weak inhibition of the more selective substrate-competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Glycogen synthase kinase–3 (GSK-3) is a promising drug target for treating neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but most GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have not reached the clinic. We describe a new type of GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>, L807mts, that acts through a substrate-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> conversion mechanism that occurs within the catalytic site of the enzyme. We determined that L807mts was a potent and highly selective GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> with reasonable pharmacological and safety properties when tested in rodents. Treatment with L807mts enhanced the clearance of β-amyloid loads, reduced inflammation, enhanced autophagic flux, and improved cognitive and social skills in the 5XFAD AD mouse model. This new modality of GSK-3 inhibition may be therapeutic in patients with AD or other central nervous system disorders associated with dysregulated GSK-3.</p>

Wrapping with a splash: High-speed encapsulation with ultrathin sheets
<p>Many complex fluids rely on surfactants to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>, protect, or isolate liquid drops in an immiscible continuous phase. Thin elastic sheets can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong> liquid drops in a spontaneous process driven by capillary forces. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">encapsul</span></strong>ation by sheets to be practically viable, a rapid, continuous, and scalable process is essential. We exploit the fast dynamics of droplet impact to achieve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>ping of oil droplets by ultrathin polymer films in a water phase. Despite the violence of splashing events, the process robustly yields <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>pings that are optimally shaped to maximize the enclosed fluid volume and have near-perfect seams. We achieve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>pings of targeted three-dimensional (3D) shapes by tailoring the 2D boundary of the films and show the generality of the technique by producing both oil-in-water and water-in-oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wrap</span></strong>pings.</p>

A Magnesium Transporter OsMGT1 Plays a Critical Role in Salt Tolerance in Rice
<p>Salt stress is one of the major factors limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production globally. Although several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers involved in salt tolerance have been identified in rice, the mechanisms regulating their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> activity are still poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er OsMGT1 is required for salt tolerance probably by regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> activity of OsHKT1;5, a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er for the removal of Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem sap at the root mature zone. Knockout of <i>OsMGT1</i> did not affect total Na uptake, but increased Na concentration in the shoots and xylem sap, resulting in a significant increase in salt sensitivity at low external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (20–200 μ<sc>m</sc>). However, such differences were abolished at a higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (2 m<sc>m</sc>), although the total Na uptake was not altered. <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in both the roots and shoots, but only that in the roots was moderately up-regulated by salt stress. Spatial expression analysis revealed that <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in all root cells of the root tips but was highly expressed in the pericycle of root mature zone. <i>OsMGT1</i> was also expressed in the phloem region of basal node, leaf blade, and sheath. When expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> activity of OsHKT1;5 was enhanced by elevating external Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Furthermore, knockout of <i>OsHKT1;5</i> in <i>osmgt1</i> mutant background did not further increase its salt sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed by OsMGT1 in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na accumulation to the shoots.</p>

Opposing microtubule motors control motility, morphology and cargo segregation during ER-to-Golgi transport
<p>We recently demonstrated that dynein and kinesin motors drive multiple aspects of endosomal function in mammalian cells. These functions include driving motility, maintaining morphology (notably through providing longitudinal tension to support vesicle fission), and driving cargo sorting. Microtubule motors drive bidirectional motility during traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Here, we have examined the role of microtubule motors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> carrier motility, morphology, and domain organization during ER-to-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. We show that, consistent with our findings for endosomal dynamics, microtubule motor function during ER-to-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of secretory cargo is required for motility, morphology, and cargo sorting within vesicular tubular carriers <i>en route</i> to the Golgi. Our data are consistent with previous findings that defined roles for dynein-1, kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-2 in this trafficking step. Our high resolution tracking data identify some intriguing aspects. Depletion of kinesin-1 reduces the number of motile structures seen, which is in line with other findings relating to the role of kinesin-1 in ER export. However, those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> carriers that were produced had a much greater run length suggesting that this motor can act as a brake on anterograde motility. Kinesin-2 depletion did not significantly reduce the number of motile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> carriers but did cause a similar increase in run length. These data suggest that kinesins act as negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Depletion of dynein not only reduced the number of motile carriers formed but also caused tubulation of carriers similar to that seen for sorting nexin-coated early endosomes. Our data indicated that the previously observed anterograde–retrograde polarity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> carriers in transit to the Golgi from the ER is maintained by microtubule motor function.</p>

Androgen receptor inhibitor–induced “BRCAness” and PARP inhibition are synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer
<p>Cancers with loss-of-function mutations in <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> are deficient in the DNA damage repair pathway called homologous recombination (HR), rendering these cancers exquisitely vulnerable to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. This functional state and therapeutic sensitivity is referred to as “BRCAness” and is most commonly associated with some breast cancer types. Pharmaceutical induction of BRCAness could expand the use of PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s to other tumor types. For example, <i>BRCA</i> mutations are present in only ~20% of prostate cancer patients. We found that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells showed increased expression of a set of HR-associated genes, including <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>RAD54L</i>, and <i>RMI2</i>. Although androgen-targeted therapy is typically not effective in CRPC patients, the androgen receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> enzalutamide suppressed the expression of those HR genes in CRPC cells, thus creating HR deficiency and BRCAness. A “lead-in” treatment strategy, in which enzalutamide was followed by the PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> olaparib, promoted DNA damage–induced cell death and inhibited clonal proliferation of prostate cancer cells in culture and suppressed the growth of prostate cancer xenografts in mice. Thus, antiandrogen and PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> combination therapy may be effective for CRPC patients and suggests that pharmaceutically inducing BRCAness may expand the clinical use of PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s.</p>

Packing of apolar side chains enables accurate design of highly stable membrane proteins
<p>The features that stabilize the structures of membrane proteins remain poorly understood. Polar interactions contribute modestly, and the hydrophobic effect contributes little to the energetics of apolar side-chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pack</span></strong>ing in membranes. Disruption of steric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pack</span></strong>ing can destabilize the native folds of membrane proteins, but is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pack</span></strong>ing alone sufficient to drive folding in lipids? If so, then membrane proteins stabilized by this feature should be readily designed and structurally characterized—yet this has not been achieved. Through simulation of the natural protein phospholamban and redesign of variants, we define a steric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pack</span></strong>ing code underlying its assembly. Synthetic membrane proteins designed using this code and stabilized entirely by apolar side chains conform to the intended fold. Although highly stable, the steric complementarity required for their folding is surprisingly stringent. Structural informatics shows that the designed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pack</span></strong>ing motif recurs across the proteome, emphasizing a prominent role for precise apolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pack</span></strong>ing in membrane protein folding, stabilization, and evolution.</p>

Initial Bud Outgrowth Occurs Independent of Auxin Flow from Out of Buds
<p>Apical dominance is the process whereby the shoot tip inhibits the growth of axillary buds along the stem. It has been proposed that the shoot tip, which is the predominant source of the plant hormone auxin, prevents bud outgrowth by suppressing auxin canalization and export from axillary buds into the main stem. In this theory, auxin flow out of axillary buds is a prerequisite for bud outgrowth, and buds are triggered to grow by an enhanced proportional flow of auxin from the buds. A major challenge of directly testing this model is in being able to create a bud- or stem-specific change in auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Here we evaluate the relationship between specific changes in auxin efflux from axillary buds and bud outgrowth after shoot tip removal (decapitation) in the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>). The auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> 1-<i>N</i>-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and to a lesser extent, the auxin perception <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> <i>p</i>-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB), effectively blocked auxin efflux from axillary buds of intact and decapitated plants without affecting auxin flow in the main stem. Gene expression analyses indicate that NPA and PCIB regulate auxin-inducible, and biosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> genes, in axillary buds within 3 h after application. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s had no effect on initial bud outgrowth after decapitation or cytokinin (benzyladenine; BA) treatment. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>y effects of PCIB and NPA on axillary bud outgrowth only became apparent from 48 h after treatment. These findings demonstrate that the initiation of decapitation- and cytokinin-induced axillary bud outgrowth is independent of auxin canalization and export from the bud.</p>

The Coumarin Glucoside, Esculin, Reveals Rapid Changes in Phloem-Transport Velocity in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>The study of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> and its vital roles in long-distance communication and carbon allocation have been hampered by a lack of suitable tools that allow high-throughput, real-time studies. Esculin, a fluorescent coumarin glucoside, is recognized by Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers, including AtSUC2, which loads it into the phloem for translocation to sink tissues. These properties make it an ideal tool for use in live-imaging experiments, where it acts as a surrogate for Suc. Here, we show that esculin is translocated with a similar efficiency to Suc and, because of its ease of application and detection, demonstrate that it is an ideal tool for in vivo studies of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. We used esculin to determine the effect of different environmental cues on the velocity of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. We provide evidence that fluctuations in cotyledon Suc levels influence phloem velocity rapidly, supporting the pressure-flow model of phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Under acute changes in light levels, the phloem velocity mirrored changes in the expression of <i>AtSUC2</i>. This observation suggests that under certain environmental conditions, transcriptional regulation may affect the abundance of AtSUC2 and thus regulate the phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> velocity.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> driven by the auxin efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Sugar Transporter STP7 Specificity for <sc>l</sc>-Arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-Xylose Contrasts with the Typical Hexose Transporters STP8 and STP12
<p>The controlled distribution of sugars between assimilate-exporting source tissues and sugar-consuming sink tissues is a key element for plant growth and development. Monosaccharide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers of the SUGAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> PROTEIN (STP) family contribute to the uptake of sugars into sink cells. Here, we report on the characterization of STP7, STP8, and STP12, three previously uncharacterized members of this family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Heterologous expression in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) revealed that STP8 and STP12 catalyze the high-affinity proton-dependent uptake of glucose and also accept galactose and mannose. STP12 additionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>s xylose. <i>STP8</i> and <i>STP12</i> are highly expressed in reproductive organs, where their protein products might contribute to sugar uptake into the pollen tube and the embryo sac. <i>stp8.1</i> and <i>stp12.1</i> T-DNA insertion lines developed normally, which may point toward functional redundancy with other STPs. In contrast to all other STPs, STP7 does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> hexoses but is specific for the pentoses <sc>l</sc>-arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-xylose. <i>STP7-</i>promoter-reporter gene plants showed an expression of <i>STP7</i> especially in tissues with high cell wall turnover, indicating that STP7 might contribute to the uptake and recycling of cell wall sugars. Uptake analyses with radioactive <sc>l</sc>-arabinose revealed that 11 other STPs are able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> <sc>l</sc>-arabinose with high affinity. Hence, functional redundancy might explain the missing-mutant phenotype of two <i>stp7</i> T-DNA insertion lines. Together, these data complete the characterization of the STP family and present the STPs as new <sc>l</sc>-arabinose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers for potential biotechnological applications.</p>

Vacuolar Transporters – Companions on a Longtime Journey
<p>Biochemical and electrophysiological studies on plant vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers became feasible in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when methods to isolate large quantities of intact vacuoles and purified vacuolar membrane vesicles were established. However, with the exception of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and H<sup>+</sup>-PPase, which could be followed due to their hydrolytic activities, attempts to purify tonoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers were for a long time not successful. Heterologous complementation, T-DNA insertion mutants, and later proteomic studies allowed the next steps, starting from the 1990s. Nowadays, our knowledge about vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers has increased greatly. Nevertheless, there are several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers of central importance that have still to be identified at the molecular level or have even not been characterized biochemically. Furthermore, our knowledge about regulation of the vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers is very limited, and much work is needed to get a holistic view about the interplay of the vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ome. The huge amount of information generated during the last 35 years cannot be summarized in such a review. Therefore, I decided to concentrate on some aspects where we were involved during my research on vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers, for some our laboratories contributed more, while others contributed less.</p>

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p>Water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant water balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e can be derived from rehydration and water-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with water, water uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e capacitance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e compartments for capillary water refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

Wheat Vacuolar Iron Transporter TaVIT2 Transports Fe and Mn and Is Effective for Biofortification
<p>Increasing the intrinsic nutritional quality of crops, known as biofortification, is viewed as a sustainable approach to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies. In particular, iron deficiency anemia is a major global health issue, but the iron content of staple crops such as wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) is difficult to change because of genetic complexity and homeostasis mechanisms. To identify target genes for the biofortification of wheat, we functionally characterized homologs of the <i>VACUOLAR IRON <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ER</i> (<i>VIT</i>). The wheat genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s two <i>VIT</i> paralogs, <i>TaVIT1</i> and <i>TaVIT2</i>, which have different expression patterns but are both low in the endosperm. TaVIT2, but not TaVIT1, was able to rescue the growth of a yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) mutant defective in vacuolar iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. TaVIT2 also complemented a manganese <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er mutant but not a vacuolar zinc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er mutant. By overexpressing <i>TaVIT2</i> under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, we achieved a greater than 2-fold increase in iron in white flour fractions, exceeding minimum legal fortification levels in countries such as the United Kingdom. The antinutrient phytate was not increased and the iron in the white flour fraction was bioavailable in vitro, suggesting that food products made from the biofortified flour could contribute to improved iron nutrition. The single-gene approach impacted minimally on plant growth and also was effective in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Our results show that by enhancing vacuolar iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in the endosperm, this essential micronutrient accumulated in this tissue, bypassing existing homeostatic mechanisms.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p>Metal accumulation in seeds is a prerequisite for germination and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> processes and their interactions in seeds, we focused on METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>s Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjecting seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er plays an important role in the generation of seed metal stores as well as for metal homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

Global Sensitivity Analysis of OnGuard Models Identifies Key Hubs for Transport Interaction in Stomatal Dynamics
<p>The physical requirement for charge to balance across biological membranes means that the transmembrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of each ionic species is interrelated, and manipulating solute flux through any one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er will affect other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers at the same membrane, often with unforeseen consequences. The OnGuard systems modeling platform has helped to resolve the mechanics of stomatal movements, uncovering previously unexpected behaviors of stomata. To date, however, the manual approach to exploring model parameter space has captured little formal information about the emergent connections between parameters that define the most interesting properties of the system as a whole. Here, we introduce global sensitivity analysis to identify interacting parameters affecting a number of outputs commonly accessed in experiments in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The analysis highlights synergies between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers affecting the balance between Ca<sup>2+</sup> sequestration and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release pathways, notably those associated with internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and their turnover. Other, unexpected synergies appear, including with the plasma membrane anion channels and H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and with the tonoplast TPK K<sup>+</sup> channel. These emergent synergies, and the core hubs of interaction that they define, identify subsets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers associated with free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration that represent key targets to enhance plant performance in the future. They also highlight the importance of interactions between the voltage regulation of the plasma membrane and tonoplast in coordinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> between the different cellular compartments.</p>

Sucrose Transporter Localization and Function in Phloem Unloading in Developing Stems
<p>How sucrose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers (SUTs) regulate phloem unloading in monocot stems is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high Suc concentrations. To this end, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> SUTs SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 were characterized by determining their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> properties heterologously expressed in yeast or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and their in planta cellular and subcellular localization. The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong selectivity for Suc and high Suc affinities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at pH 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc affinity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and pH. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc affinity was independent of membrane potential and pH but supported high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> rates at neutral pH. Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using yeast or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to sieve elements, while for elongating and recently elongated internodes, SUTs also were detected in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc unloading from de-energized protophloem sieve elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of elongating and recently elongated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to release Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic unloading pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into metaphloem sieve elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic unloading by bulk flow.</p>

Phloem Transport of the Receptor DWARF14 Protein Is Required for Full Function of Strigolactones<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The cell-to-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of signaling molecules is essential for multicellular organisms to coordinate the action of their cells. Recent studies identified DWARF14 (D14) as a receptor of strigolactones (SLs), molecules that act as plant hormones and inhibit shoot branching. Here, we demonstrate that <i>RAMOSUS3</i>, a pea ortholog of <i>D14</i>, works as a graft-transmissible signal to suppress shoot branching. In addition, we show that D14 protein is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed in phloem sap and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed through the phloem to axillary buds in rice. SLs are not required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of D14 protein. Disruption of D14 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> weakens the suppression of axillary bud outgrowth of rice. Taken together, we conclude that the D14 protein works as an intercellular signaling molecule to fine-tune SL function. Our findings provide evidence that the intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> of a receptor can regulate the action of plant hormones.</p>

Targeting NOTCH activation in small cell lung cancer through LSD1 inhibition
<p>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant, aggressive neuroendocrine-type cancer for which little change to first-line standard-of-care treatment has occurred within the last few decades. Unlike nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SCLC harbors few actionable mutations for therapeutic intervention. Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1 also known as KDM1A) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s were previously shown to have selective activity in SCLC models, but the underlying mechanism was elusive. Here, we found that exposure to the selective LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> ORY-1001 activated the NOTCH pathway, resulting in the suppression of the transcription factor ASCL1 and the repression of SCLC tumorigenesis. Our analyses revealed that LSD1 bound to the <i>NOTCH1</i> locus, thereby suppressing NOTCH1 expression and downstream signaling. Reactivation of NOTCH signaling with the LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> reduced the expression of ASCL1 and neuroendocrine cell lineage genes. Knockdown studies confirmed the pharmacological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>-based results. In vivo, sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition in SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models correlated with the extent of consequential NOTCH pathway activation and repression of a neuroendocrine phenotype. Complete and durable tumor regression occurred with ORY-1001–induced NOTCH activation in a chemoresistant PDX model. Our findings reveal how LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s function in this tumor and support their potential as a new and targeted therapy for SCLC.</p>

Skp2-dependent reactivation of AKT drives resistance to PI3K inhibitors
<p>The PI3K-AKT kinase signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers, particularly breast cancer, where amplification and somatic mutations of <i>PIK3CA</i> occur with high frequency in patients. Numerous small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s targeting both PI3K and AKT are under clinical evaluation, but dose-limiting toxicities and the emergence of resistance limit therapeutic efficacy. Various resistance mechanisms to PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have been identified, including de novo mutations, feedback activation of AKT, or cross-talk pathways. We found a previously unknown resistance mechanism to PI3K pathway inhibition that results in AKT rebound activation. In a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, treatment with a PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> or depletion of <i>PIK3CA</i> expression ultimately promoted AKT reactivation in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2, the kinases IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and the cell growth and metabolism-regulating complex mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2), but was independent of PI3K activity or PIP<sub>3</sub> production. Resistance to PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s correlated with the increased abundance of Skp2, ubiquitylation of AKT, cell proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. These findings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> resistance may emerge in aggressive breast cancer cells.</p>

Inflammatory but not mitogenic contexts prime synovial fibroblasts for compensatory signaling responses to p38 inhibition
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that causes joint pain, swelling, and loss of function. Development of effective new drugs has proven challenging in part because of the complexities and interconnected nature of intracellular signaling networks that complicate the effects of pharmacological interventions. We characterized the kinase signaling pathways that are activated in RA and evaluated the multivariate effects of targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Synovial fluids from RA patients activated the kinase signaling pathways JAK, JNK, p38, and MEK in synovial fibroblasts (SFs), a stromal cell type that promotes RA progression. Kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s enhanced signaling of “off-target” pathways in a manner dependent on stimulatory context. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of p38, which have been widely explored in clinical trials for RA, resulted in undesirable increases in nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JNK, and MEK signaling in SFs in inflammatory, but not mitogenic, contexts. This was mediated by the transcription factor CREB, which functions in part within a negative feedback loop in MAPK signaling. CREB activation was induced predominately by p38 in response to inflammatory stimuli, but by MEK in response to mitogenic stimuli; hence, the effects of drugs targeting p38 or MEK were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>edly different in SFs cultured under mitogenic or inflammatory conditions. Together, these findings illustrate how stimulatory context can alter dominance in pathway cross-talk even for a fixed network topology, thereby providing a rationale for why p38 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s deliver limited benefits in RA and demonstrating the need for careful consideration of p38-targeted drugs in inflammation-related disorders.</p>

Identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of type 1 adenylyl cyclase activity with analgesic properties
<p>Adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) belongs to a group of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) that are stimulated by calcium in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Studies with AC1 knockout mice suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of AC1 may be useful for treating pain and opioid dependence. However, nonselective inhibition of AC isoforms could result in substantial adverse effects. We used chemical library screening to identify a selective AC1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> with a chromone core structure that may represent a new analgesic agent. After demonstrating that the compound (ST034307) inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably transfected with AC1 (HEK-AC1 cells), we confirmed selectivity for AC1 by testing against all isoforms of membrane-bound ACs. ST034307 also inhibited AC1 activity stimulated by forskolin- and Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors in HEK-AC1 cells and showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>y activity in multiple AC1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing membrane preparations and mouse hippocampal homogenates. ST034307 enhanced μ-opioid receptor (MOR)–mediated inhibition of AC1 in short-term inhibition assays in HEK-AC1 cells stably transfected with MOR; however, the compound blocked heterologous sensitization of AC1 caused by chronic MOR activation in these cells. ST034307 reduced pain responses in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. Our data indicate that ST034307 is a selective small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> of AC1 and suggest that selective AC1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s may be useful for managing pain.</p>

Mechanism of allosteric modulation of P-glycoprotein by transport substrates and inhibitors

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals
<p>Multiple human diseases ensue from a hereditary or acquired deficiency of iron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ing protein function that diminishes transmembrane iron flux in distinct sites and directions. Because other iron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> proteins remain active, labile iron gradients build up across the corresponding protein-deficient membranes. Here we report that a small-molecule natural product, hinokitiol, can harness such gradients to restore iron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> into, within, and/or out of cells. The same compound promotes gut iron absorption in DMT1-deficient rats and ferroportin-deficient mice, as well as hemoglobinization in DMT1- and mitoferrin-deficient zebrafish.

Long-range hot-carrier transport in hybrid perovskites visualized by ultrafast microscopy

Pinstatic Acid Promotes Auxin Transport by Inhibiting PIN Internalization
<p>Polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> plays a pivotal role in plant growth and development. PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers regulate directional auxin movement by establishing local auxin maxima, minima, and gradients that drive multiple developmental processes and responses to environmental signals. Auxin has been proposed to modulate its own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> by regulating subcellular PIN trafficking via processes such as clathrin-mediated PIN endocytosis and constitutive recycling. Here, we further investigated the mechanisms by which auxin affects PIN trafficking by screening auxin analogs and identified pinstatic acid (PISA) as a positive modulator of polar auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). PISA had an auxin-like effect on hypocotyl elongation and adventitious root formation via positive regulation of auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. PISA did not activate SCF<sup>TIR1/AFB</sup> signaling and yet induced PIN accumulation at the cell surface by inhibiting PIN internalization from the plasma membrane.

SULTR3s Function in Chloroplast Sulfate Uptake and Affect ABA Biosynthesis and the Stress Response
<p>Plants are major sulfur reducers in the global sulfur cycle. Sulfate, the major natural sulfur source in soil, is absorbed by plant roots and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed into plastids, where it is reduced and assimilated into Cys for further metabolic processes. Despite its importance, how sulfate is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed into plastids is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated using single Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genetic mutants that each member of the sulfate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er (SULTR) subfamily 3 was able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> sulfate across the chloroplast envelope membrane. To resolve the function of SULTR3s, we constructed a <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant completely knocking out all five members of the subfamily. Here we report that all members of the <i>SULTR3</i> subfamily show chloroplast membrane localization. Sulfate uptake by chloroplasts of the quintuple mutant is reduced by more than 50% compared with the wild type. Consequently, Cys and abscisic acid (ABA) content are reduced to ∼67 and ∼20% of the wild-type level, respectively, and strong positive correlations are found among sulfate, Cys, and ABA content. The <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant shows obvious growth retardation with smaller rosettes and shorter roots. Seed germination of the <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and salt stress, but is rescued by sulfide supplementation. Furthermore, sulfate-induced stomatal closure is abolished in the quintuple mutant, strongly suggesting that chloroplast sulfate is required for stomatal closure. Our genetic analyses unequivocally demonstrate that sulfate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er subfamily 3 is responsible for more than half of the chloroplast sulfate uptake and influences downstream sulfate assimilation and ABA biosynthesis.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Inhibits Auxin-Induced Lateral Rooting Independently of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 Receptor
<p>Plant root systems are indispensable for water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and anchoring plants in the soil. Previous studies using auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s definitively established that auxin plays a central role regulating root growth and development. Most auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s affect all auxin signaling at the same time, which obscures an understanding of individual events. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a lateral root (LR)-preferential auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in a manner that is independent of the JA receptor, CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1). Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with either (−)-JA or (+)-JA reduced primary root length and LR number; the reduction of LR number was also observed in <i>coi1</i> mutants. Treatment of seedlings with (−)-JA or (+)-JA suppressed auxin-inducible genes related to LR formation, diminished accumulation of the auxin reporter <i>DR5::GUS</i>, and inhibited auxin-dependent DII-VENUS degradation. A structural mimic of (−)-JA and (+)-coronafacic acid also inhibited LR formation and stabilized DII-VENUS protein.

ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-term or long-term exposure to fatty acids in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing oleic acid), which results in reversible or irreversible ACCase inhibition, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin carboxyl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporation into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing) biotin carboxyltransferase protein subunits. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing T-DNA insertions in <i>BADC1</i>, <i>BADC2</i>, and <i>BADC3</i> were used to generate <i>badc1 badc2</i> and <i>badc1 badc3</i> double mutants. The <i>badc1 badc3</i> mutant exhibited normal growth and development; however, ACCase activity was 26% higher in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and its seeds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed 30.1% more fatty acids and 32.6% more triacylgycerol relative to wild-type plants. To assess whether BADC contributes to the irreversible phase of ACCase inhibition, cell suspension cultures were generated from the leaves of <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type plants and treated with 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tween 80. Reversible ACCase inhibition was similar in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type cultures after 2 d of Tween 80 treatment, but irreversible inhibition was reduced by 50% in <i>badc1 badc3</i> relative to wild-type plants following 4 d of Tween 80 treatment. In this study, we present evidence for two important homeostatic roles for BADC proteins in down-regulating ACCase activity: by acting during normal growth and development and by contributing to its long-term irreversible feedback inhibition resulting from the oversupply of fatty acids.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> and that an excess capacity for alternative electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> is necessary to overcome vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Rice Sucrose Partitioning Mediated by a Putative Pectin Methyltransferase and Homogalacturonan Methylesterification
<p>Homogalacturonan (HG) is the main component of pectins. HG methylesterification has recently emerged as a key determinant controlling cell attachment, organ formation, and phyllotaxy. However, whether and how HG methylesterification affects intercellular metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> has rarely been reported. Here, we identified and characterized knockout mutants of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>OsQUA2</i> gene encoding a putative pectin methyltransferase. <i>Osqua2</i> mutants exhibit a re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>able decrease in the degree of methylesterification of HG in the culm-sieve element cell wall and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>edly reduced grain yield. The culm of <i>Osqua2</i> mutant plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s excessive sucrose (Suc), and a <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> feeding experiment showed that the Suc overaccumulation in the culm was caused by blocked Suc translocation. These and other findings demonstrate that OsQUA2 is essential for maintaining a high degree of methylesterification of HG in the rice culm-sieve element cell wall, which may be critical for efficient Suc partitioning and grain filling. In addition, our results suggest that the apoplastic pathway is involved in long-distance Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in rice. The identification and characterization of the <i>OsQUA2</i> gene and its functionality revealed a previously unknown contribution of HG methylesterification and provided insight into how modification of the cell wall regulates intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> in plants.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

cis-Cinnamic Acid Is a Novel, Natural Auxin Efflux Inhibitor That Promotes Lateral Root Formation
<p>Auxin steers numerous physiological processes in plants, making the tight control of its endogenous levels and spatiotemporal distribution a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms, including auxin biosynthesis, metabolic conversions, degradation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Here, we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (<i>c</i>-CA) as a novel and unique addition to a small group of endogenous molecules affecting in planta auxin concentrations. <i>c-CA</i> is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (<i>t</i>-CA). When grown on <i>c</i>-CA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of plant species were shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high auxin levels, including inhibition of primary root growth, induction of root hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral rooting. By molecular docking and receptor binding assays, we showed that <i>c</i>-CA itself is neither an auxin nor an anti-auxin, and auxin profiling data revealed that <i>c</i>-CA does not significantly interfere with auxin biosynthesis. Single cell-based auxin accumulation assays showed that <i>c</i>-CA, and not <i>t</i>-CA, is a potent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> of auxin efflux. Auxin signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal distribution of the auxin response along the root of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants, and long-distance auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> assays showed no inhibition of rootward auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants are the consequence of a local change in auxin accumulation, induced by the inhibition of auxin efflux. This work reveals a novel mechanism how plants may regulate auxin levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of auxin homeostasis.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A murine <i>Zic3</i> transcript with a premature termination codon evades nonsense-mediated decay during axis formation
<p>The ZIC transcription factors are key mediators of embryonic development and <i>ZIC3</i> is the gene most commonly associated with <i>situs</i> defects (heterotaxy) in humans. Half of patient <i>ZIC3</i> mutations introduce a premature termination codon (PTC). <i>In vivo</i>, PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcripts might be targeted for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). NMD efficiency is known to vary greatly between transcripts, tissues and individuals and it is possible that differences in survival of PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcripts partially explain the striking phenotypic variability that characterizes ZIC3-associated congenital defects. For example, the PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcripts might encode a C-terminally truncated protein that retains partial function or that dominantly interferes with other ZIC family members. Here we describe the katun (<i>Ka</i>) mouse mutant, which harbours a mutation in the <i>Zic3</i> gene that results in a PTC. At the time of axis formation there is no discernible decrease in this PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcript <i>in vivo</i>, indicating that the mammalian <i>Zic3</i> transcript is relatively insensitive to NMD, prompting the need to re-examine the molecular function of the truncated proteins predicted from human studies and to determine whether the N-terminal portion of ZIC3 possesses dominant-negative capabilities. A combination of <i>in vitro</i> studies and analysis of the <i>Ka</i> phenotype indicate that it is a null allele of <i>Zic3</i> and that the N-terminal portion of ZIC3 does not encode a dominant-negative molecule. Heterotaxy in patients with PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing <i>ZIC3</i> transcripts probably arises due to loss of ZIC3 function alone.</p>

Myosins XI Are Involved in Exocytosis of Cellulose Synthase Complexes
<p>In plants, cellulose is synthesized at the cell surface by plasma membrane (PM)-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that underpin delivery of CSCs to the PM, however, are poorly understood. Cortical microtubules have been shown to interact with CESA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing compartments and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong> the site for CSC delivery, but are not required for the delivery itself. Here, we demonstrate that myosin XI and the actin cytoskeleton mediate CSC delivery to the PM by coordinating the exocytosis of CESA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing compartments. Measurement of cellulose content indicated that cellulose biosynthesis was significantly reduced in a <i>myosin xik xi1 xi2</i> triple-knockout mutant. By combining genetic and pharmacological disruption of myosin activity with quantitative live-cell imaging, we observed decreased abundance of PM-localized CSCs and reduced delivery rate of CSCs in myosin-deficient cells. These phenotypes correlated with a significant increase in failed vesicle secretion events at the PM as well as an abnormal accumulation of CESA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing compartments at the cell cortex. Through high-resolution spatiotemporal assays of cortical vesicle behavior, we identified defects in CSC vesicle tethering and fusion at the PM. Furthermore, disruption of myosin activity reduced the delivery of several other secretory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mark</span></strong>ers to the PM and reduced constitutive and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These findings reveal a previously undescribed role for myosin in vesicle secretion and cellulose production at the cytoskeleton-PM-cell wall nexus.</p>

Vacuolar Phosphate Transporters Contribute to Systemic Phosphate Homeostasis Vital for Reproductive Development in Arabidopsis
<p>Vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e of phosphate (Pi) is essential for Pi homeostasis in plants. Recent studies have identified a family of vacuolar Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers, VPTs (PHT5s), responsible for vacuolar sequestration of Pi. We report here that both VPT1 and VPT3 contribute to cytosol-to-vacuole Pi partitioning. Although VPT1 plays a predominant role, VPT3 is particularly important when VPT1 is absent. Our data suggested that the <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> double mutant was more defective in Pi homeostasis than the <i>vpt1</i> single mutant, as indicated by Pi accumulation capacity, vacuolar Pi influx, subcellular Pi allocation, and plant adaptability to changing Pi status. The remaining member of the VPT family, VPT2 (PHT5;2), did not appear to contribute to Pi homeostasis in such assays. Particularly interesting is the finding that the <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> double mutant was impaired in reproductive development with shortened siliques and impaired seed set under sufficient Pi, and this phenotype was not found in the <i>vpt1 vpt2</i> and <i>vpt2 vpt3</i> double mutants. Measurements of Pi contents revealed Pi over-accumulation in the floral organs of <i>vpt1 vpt3</i> as compared with the wild type. Further analysis identified excess Pi in the pistil as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>y to pollen tube growth, and thus seed yield, in the mutant plants. Reducing the Pi levels in culture medium or mutation of PHO1, a Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> protein responsible for root-shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>, restored the seed set of <i>vpt1 vpt3</i>. Thus, VPTs, through their function in vacuolar Pi sequestration, control the fine-tuning of systemic Pi allocation, which is particularly important for reproductive development.</p>

OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation, and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes
<p>Plant roots rely on inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers to acquire soluble Pi from soil solutions that exists at micromolar levels in natural ecosystems. Here, we functionally characterized a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er, Os Phosphate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er-1;3 (OsPHT1;3), that mediates Pi uptake, translocation, and remobilization. <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was directly regulated by Os Phosphate Starvation Response-2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades. OsPHT1;3 was able to complement a yeast mutant strain defective in five Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers and mediate Pi influx in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. Overexpression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots. However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members that facilitate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation only when external Pi concentration was below 5 μ<sc>m</sc>. Moreover, in basal nodes, the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was restricted to the phloem of regular vascular bundles and enlarged vascular bundles. An isotope labeling experiment with <sup>32</sup>P showed that <i>ospht1</i>;<i>3</i> mutant lines were impaired in remobilization of Pi from source to sink leaves. Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>2</i> and several other <i>OsPHT1</i> genes. Yeast-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated a physical interaction between OsPHT1;3 and OsPHT1;2. Taken together, our results indicate that OsPHT1;3 acts as a crucial factor for Pi acquisition, root-to-shoot Pi translocation, and redistribution of phosphorus in plants growing in environments with extremely low Pi levels.</p>

Heterohexamers Formed by CcmK3 and CcmK4 Increase the Complexity of Beta Carboxysome Shells
<p>Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">encapsul</span></strong>ate enzymes within a selectively permeable, proteinaceous shell. Carboxysomes are BMCs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase and carbonic anhydrase that enhance carbon dioxide fixation. The carboxysome shell consists of three structurally characterized protein types, each named after the oligomer they form: BMC-H (hexamer), BMC-P (pentamer), and BMC-T (trimer). These three protein types form cyclic homooligomers with pores at the center of symmetry that enable metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> across the shell. Carboxysome shells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong> multiple BMC-H paralogs, each with distinctly conserved residues surrounding the pore, which are assumed to be associated with specific metabolites. We studied the regulation of β-carboxysome shell composition by investigating the BMC-H genes <i>ccmK3</i> and <i>ccmK4</i> situated in a locus remote from other carboxysome genes. We made single and double deletion mutants of <i>ccmK3</i> and <i>ccmK4</i> in <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942 and show that, unlike CcmK3, CcmK4 is necessary for optimal growth. In contrast to other CcmK proteins, CcmK3 does not form homohexamers; instead CcmK3 forms heterohexamers with CcmK4 with a 1:2 stoichiometry. The CcmK3-CcmK4 heterohexamers form stacked dodecamers in a pH-dependent manner. Our results indicate that CcmK3-CcmK4 heterohexamers potentially expand the range of permeability properties of metabolite channels in carboxysome shells. Moreover, the observed facultative formation of dodecamers in solution suggests that carboxysome shell permeability may be dynamically attenuated by “capping” facet-embedded hexamers with a second hexamer. Because β-carboxysomes are obligately expressed, heterohexamer formation and capping could provide a rapid and reversible means to alter metabolite flux across the shell in response to environmental/growth conditions.</p>

Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p>Auxin controls body plan patterning in land plants and has been proposed to play a similar role in the development of brown algae (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with land plants. The mechanism of auxin action in brown algae remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model system to show that auxin plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown algae. Indole-3-acetic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally develop a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meristem from the other, addition of exogenous auxins to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo developed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when variable extrinsic informational cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers in land plants, affected rhizoid formation by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of auxin genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers from land plants have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>. Together with reports on auxin function in basal lineages of green algae, these results suggest that auxin function predates the divergence between the green and brown lineage and the transition toward land plants.</p>

Functional Analysis of Short Linear Motifs in the Plant Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor SIAMESE
<p>Endoreplication, a modified cell cycle in which DNA is replicated without subsequent cell division, plays an important but poorly understood role in plant growth and in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SIAMESE</i> (<i>SIM</i>) gene encodes the first identified member of the SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) family of cyclin-dependent kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. <i>SIM</i> controls endoreplication during trichome development, and <i>sim</i> mutant trichomes divide several times instead of endoreplicating their DNA. The SMR family is defined by several short linear amino acid sequence motifs of largely unknown function, and family members have little sequence similarity to any known protein functional domains. Here, we investigated the roles of the conserved motifs in <i>SIM</i> site-directed Arabidopsis mutants using several functional assays. We identified a potential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-binding site, which bears no resemblance to other known CDK interaction motifs. We also identified a potential site of phosphorylation and two redundant nuclear localization sequences. Surprisingly, the only motif with similarity to the other family of plant CDK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>/INTERACTOR OF CDC2 KINASE/KIP-RELATED PROTEIN proteins, is not required for <i>SIM</i> function in vivo. Because even highly divergent members of the <i>SMR</i> family are able to replace <i>SIM</i> function in Arabidopsis trichomes, it is likely that the results obtained here for <i>SIM</i> will apply to other members of this plant-specific family of CDK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s.</p>

The MtMATE67 gene was induced early during nodule development and expressed primarily in the invasion zone of mature nodules. The MtMATE67 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of nodule cells and also the symbiosome membrane surrounding bacteroids in infected cells. In oocytes, MtMATE67 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ed citrate out of cells in an Fe-activated manner. Loss of <i>MtMATE67</i> gene function resulted in accumulation of Fe in the apoplasm of nodule cells and a substantial decrease in symbiotic nitrogen fixation and plant growth. Taken together, the results point to a primary role of MtMATE67 in citrate efflux from nodule cells in response to an Fe signal. This efflux is necessary to ensure Fe(III) solubility and mobility in the apoplasm and uptake into nodule cells. Likewise, MtMATE67-mediated citrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> into the symbiosome space would increase the solubility and availability of Fe(III) for rhizobial bacteroids.</p>

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts
<p>Chloroplasts import many preproteins that can be classified based on their physicochemical properties. The cleavable N-terminal transit peptide (TP) of chloroplast preproteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s all the information required for import into chloroplasts through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of whether and how the physicochemical properties of preproteins affect TP-mediated import into chloroplasts has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient translocation through the chloroplast envelope membranes for proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or proteins prone to aggregation. By contrast, the translocation of soluble proteins through the chloroplast envelope membranes is less dependent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate protein translocation into chloroplasts; instead, these mutant TPs led to protein mistargeting to the chloroplast envelope membranes or nonspecific protein aggregation during import into chloroplasts. The mistargeting of TMD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing proteins caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which preprotein translocation is compromised. We propose that the physicochemical properties of chloroplast proteins affect protein translocation through the chloroplast envelope, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient translocation of TMD-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing proteins.</p>

A Tonoplast Sugar Transporter Underlies a Sugar Accumulation QTL in Watermelon
<p>How sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>ers regulate sugar accumulation in fruits is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high-concentration Suc. Accumulation of soluble sugars in watermelon (<i>Citrullus lanatus</i>) fruit, a major quality trait, had been selected during domestication. Still, the molecular mechanisms controlling this quantitative trait are unknown. We resequenced 96 recombinant inbred lines, derived from crossing sweet and unsweet accessions, to narrow down the size of a previously described sugar content quantitative trait locus, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s a putative <i>Tonoplast Sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>er</i> gene (<i>ClTST2</i>). Molecular and biochemical analyses indicated that <i>ClTST2</i> encodes a vacuolar membrane protein, whose expression is associated with tonoplast uptake and accumulation of sugars in watermelon fruit flesh cells. We measured fruit sugar content and resequenced the genomic region surrounding <i>ClTST2</i> in 400 watermelon accessions and associated the most sugar-related significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Large-scale population analyses strongly suggest increased expression of <i>ClTST2</i> as a major molecular event in watermelon domestication associated with a selection sweep around the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Further molecular analyses explored the binding of a sugar-induced transcription factor (<i>SUSIWM1</i>) to a sugar-responsive cis‐element within the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s the quantitative trait locus (QTL) causal SNP. The functional characterization of <i>ClTST2</i> and its expression regulation by <i>SUSIWM1</i> provide novel tools to increase sugar sink potency in watermelon and possibly in other vegetable and fruit crops.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf hydraulic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During drought-induced dehydration, the leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the hydraulic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong>. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild water stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transport</span></strong> during progressive drought.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ance. We present a method for using chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmitt</span></strong>ance to calculate depth-resolved photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both intestinal water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

Evolution of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish mineralocorticoid receptors: Allosteric influence on steroid specificity
<p>Although multiple steroid ligands of the glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and progestin families bind to and regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), the responses to these ligands differ across species. To understand how the different domains of MRs contribute to the ligand-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation or inhibition of MR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, we studied the response to eight steroids (aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, corticosterone, progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone) of human, chicken, alligator, frog, and zebrafish full-length MRs and truncated MRs, which lacked the N-terminal domain (NTD) and DNA binding domain (DBD). Compared to full-length MRs, some truncated MRs were not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by the steroids, and others required higher steroid concentrations for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Progesterone, 19-norprogesterone, and spironolactone did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate full-length or truncated human, alligator, or frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these steroids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs, whereas at 100 nM, these steroids had little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity for truncated chicken MRs, but they retained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity for truncated zebrafish MRs. This suggests that regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the chicken MR by progestin resides in the NTD-DBD and that of the zebrafish MR resides in the hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser<sup>810</sup> in human MR, which is required for the antagonist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of progesterone for human MR, suggesting a previously uncharacterized mechanism of regulation of progestin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of chicken and zebrafish MRs. These findings suggest that progesterone may be a physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator of chicken and zebrafish MRs.</p>

Analysis of Posttranslational Activation of Alternative Oxidase Isoforms
<p>Mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) in plants is a non-proton-motive ubiquinol oxidase that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by redox mechanisms and 2-oxo acids. A comparative analysis of the AOX isoenzymes AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) revealed that cysteine residues, CysI and CysII, are both involved in 2-oxo acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation, with AOX1A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity being more increased by 2-oxo acids than that of AOX1C and AOX1D. Substitution of cysteine in AOX1A by glutamate mimicked its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by pyruvate or glyoxylate, but not in AOX1C and AOX1D. CysIII, only present in AOX1A, is not involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by reduction or metabolites, but substitutions at this position affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. AOX1A carrying a serine residue at position CysI was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by succinate, while correspondingly substituted variants of AOX1C and AOX1D were insensitive. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by glutamate at CysI and CysII is consistent with the formation of the thiohemiacetal, while succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation after changing CysI to serine suggests hemiacetal formation. Surprisingly, in AOX1A, replacement of CysI by alanine, which cannot form a (thio)hemiacetal, led to even higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities, pointing to an alternative mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AOX isoforms are differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation at CysI and CysII is additive.</p>

The pseudokinase domains of guanylyl cyclase–A and –B allosterically increase the affinity of their catalytic domains for substrate
<p>Natriuretic peptides regulate multiple physiologic systems by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating transmembrane receptors containing intracellular guanylyl cyclase domains, such as GC-A and GC-B, also known as Npr1 and Npr2, respectively. Both enzymes contain an intracellular, phosphorylated pseudokinase domain (PKD) critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the C-terminal cGMP-synthesizing guanylyl cyclase domain. Because ATP allosterically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates GC-A and GC-B, we investigated how ATP binding to the PKD influenced guanylyl cyclase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Molecular modeling indicated that all the residues of the ATP-binding site of the prototypical kinase PKA, except the catalytic aspartate, are conserved in the PKDs of GC-A and GC-B. Kinase-in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating alanine substitutions for the invariant lysine in subdomain II or the aspartate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-B failed to decrease enzyme phosphate content, consistent with the PKDs lacking kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. In contrast, both mutations reduced enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by blocking the ability of ATP to decrease the Michaelis constant without affecting peptide-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. The analogous lysine-to-alanine substitution in a glutamate-substituted phosphomimetic mutant form of GC-B also reduced enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, consistent with ATP stimulating guanylyl cyclase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity through an allosteric, phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Mutations designed to rigidify the conserved regulatory or catalytic spines within the PKDs increased guanylyl cyclase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, increased sensitivity to natriuretic peptide, or reduced the Michaelis constant in the absence of ATP, consistent with ATP binding stabilizing the PKD in a conformation analogous to that of catalytically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e kinases. We conclude that allosteric mechanisms evolutionarily conserved in the PKDs promote the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases.</p>

A <i>LIMA1</i> variant promotes low plasma LDL cholesterol and decreases intestinal cholesterol absorption
<p>A high concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although LDL-C levels vary among humans and are heritable, the genetic factors affecting LDL-C are not fully characterized. We identified a rare frameshift variant in the <i>LIMA1</i> (also known as <i>EPLIN</i> or <i>SREBP3</i>) gene from a Chinese family of Kazakh ethnicity with inherited low LDL-C and reduced cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion.

Disease Models & Mechanisms
In <i>Drosophila</i>, RhoGEF2 cooperates with activated Ras in tumorigenesis through a pathway involving Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II and JNK signalling
<p>The <i>Ras</i> oncogene contributes to ∼30% of human cancers, but alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis. In a <i>Drosophila</i> screen for oncogenes that cooperate with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated allele of <i>Ras</i> (<i>Ras<sup>ACT</sup></i>) to promote tissue overgrowth and invasion, we identified the GTP exchange factor <i>RhoGEF2</i>, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator of Rho-family signalling. Here, we show that RhoGEF2 also cooperates with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated allele of a downstream effector of Ras, <i>Raf</i> (<i>Raf<sup>GOF</sup></i>). We dissect the downstream pathways through which RhoGEF2 cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> (and Raf<sup>GOF</sup>), and show that RhoGEF2 requires Rho1, but not Rac, for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, of the Rho1 effectors, we show that RhoGEF2 + Ras (Raf)-mediated tumorigenesis requires the Rho kinase (Rok)–Myosin-II pathway, but not Diaphanous, Lim kinase or protein kinase N. The Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II pathway leads to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Jun kinase (JNK), in cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>. Moreover, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Rok or Myosin II, using constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e transgenes, is sufficient for cooperative tumorigenesis with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>, and together with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> leads to strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of JNK. Our results show that Rok–Myosin-II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity is necessary and sufficient for Ras-mediated tumorigenesis. Our observation that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Myosin II, which regulates Filamentous actin (F-actin) contractility without affecting F-actin levels, cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> to promote JNK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and tumorigenesis, suggests that increased cell contractility is a key factor in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we show that signalling via the Tumour necrosis factor (TNF; also known as Egr)-ligand–JNK pathway is most likely the predominant pathway that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates JNK upon Rok <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Overall, our analysis highlights the need for further analysis of the Rok–Myosin-II pathway in cooperation with Ras in human cancers.</p>

Phosphorylation of the phosphatase PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that controls osteoclast activity and bone mass in vivo
<p>Bone resorption by osteoclasts is essential for bone homeostasis. The kinase Src promotes osteoclast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated in osteoclasts by the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase PTPROt. In other contexts, however, PTPROt can inhibit Src <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that PTPROt is bifunctional and can dephosphorylate Src both at its inhibitory residue Tyr<sup>527</sup> and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating residue Tyr<sup>416</sup>. Whereas wild-type and PTPROt knockout mice exhibited similar bone masses, mice in which a putative C-terminal phosphorylation site, Tyr<sup>399</sup>, in endogenous PTPROt was replaced with phenylalanine had increased bone mass and reduced osteoclast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Osteoclasts from the knock-in mice also showed reduced Src <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Experiments in cultured cells and in osteoclasts derived from both mouse strains demonstrated that the absence of phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>399</sup> caused PTPROt to dephosphorylate Src at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating site pTyr<sup>416</sup>. In contrast, phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> enabled PTPROt to recruit Src through Grb2 and to dephosphorylate Src at the inhibitory site Tyr<sup>527</sup>, thus stimulating Src <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. We conclude that reversible phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that selects between its opposing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities toward Src and maintains a coherent signaling output, and that blocking this phosphorylation event can induce physiological effects in vivo. Because most receptor-type tyrosine phosphatases contain potential phosphorylation sites at their C termini, we propose that preventing phosphorylation at these sites or its consequences may offer an alternative to inhibiting their catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity to achieve therapeutic benefit.</p>

“Disruptor” residues in the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) R12 subfamily attenuate the inactivation of Gα subunits
<p>Understanding the molecular basis of interaction specificity between RGS (regulator of G protein signaling) proteins and heterotrimeric (αβγ) G proteins would enable the manipulation of RGS-G protein interactions, explore their functions, and effectively target them therapeutically. RGS proteins are classified into four subfamilies (R4, R7, RZ, and R12) and function as negative regulators of G protein signaling by in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating Gα subunits. We found that the R12 subfamily members RGS10 and RGS14 had lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity than most R4 subfamily members toward the G<sub>i</sub> subfamily member Gα<sub>o</sub>. Using structure-based energy calculations with multiple Gα-RGS complexes, we identified R12-specific residues in positions that are predicted to determine the divergent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of this subfamily. This analysis predicted that these residues, which we call “disruptor residues,” interact with the Gα helical domain. We engineered the R12 disruptor residues into the RGS domains of the high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity R4 subfamily and found that these altered proteins exhibited reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Reciprocally, replacing the putative disruptor residues in RGS18 (a member of the R4 subfamily that exhibited low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>) with the corresponding residues from a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity R4 subfamily RGS protein increased its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Furthermore, the high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the R4 subfamily toward Gα<sub>o</sub> was independent of the residues in the homologous positions to the R12 subfamily and RGS18 disruptor residues. Thus, our results suggest that the identified RGS disruptor residues function as negative design elements that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ate RGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity for specific Gα proteins.</p>

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion increased neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, reduced GABAergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF exposure. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated disorders.</p>

TGF-β promotes PI3K-AKT signaling and prostate cancer cell migration through the TRAF6-mediated ubiquitylation of p85α
<p>Transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) is a pluripotent cytokine that regulates cell fate and plasticity in normal tissues and tumors. The multifunctional cellular responses evoked by TGF-β are mediated by the canonical SMAD pathway and by noncanonical pathways, including mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. We found that TGF-β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated PI3K in a manner dependent on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 polyubiquitylated the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α and promoted the formation of a complex between the TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and p85α, which led to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of PI3K and AKT. Lys<sup>63</sup>-linked polyubiquitylation of p85α on Lys<sup>513</sup> and Lys<sup>519</sup> in the iSH2 (inter–Src homology 2) domain was required for TGF-β–induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of PI3K-AKT signaling and cell motility in prostate cancer cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated macrophages. Unlike the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of SMAD pathways, the TRAF6-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of PI3K and AKT was not dependent on the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of TβRI. In situ proximity ligation assays revealed that polyubiquitylation of p85α was evident in aggressive prostate cancer tissues. Thus, our data reveal a molecular mechanism by which TGF-β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates the PI3K-AKT pathway to drive cell migration.</p>

Loss and Gain of Human Acidic Mammalian Chitinase Activity by Nonsynonymous SNPs
<p>Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is implicated in asthma, allergic inflammation, and food processing. Little is known about genetic and evolutional regulation of chitinolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of AMCase. Here, we relate human AMCase polymorphisms to the mouse AMCase, and show that the highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e variants encoded by nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are consistent with the mouse AMCase sequence. The chitinolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the recombinant human AMCase was significantly lower than that of the mouse counterpart. By creating mouse-human chimeric AMCase protein we found that the presence of the N-terminal region of human AMCase containing conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e site residues reduced the enzymatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the molecule. We were able to significantly increase the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of human AMCase by amino acid substitutions encoded by nsSNPs (N45, D47, and R61) with those conserved in the mouse homologue (D45, N47, and M61). For abolition of the mouse AMCase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, introduction of M61R mutation was sufficient. M61 is conserved in most of primates other than human and orangutan as well as in other mammals. Orangutan has I61 substitution, which also markedly reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the mouse AMCase, indicating that the M61 is a crucial residue for the chitinolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Altogether, our data suggest that human AMCase has lost its chitinolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity by integration of nsSNPs during evolution and that the enzyme can be re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by introducing amino acids conserved in the mouse counterpart.</p>

Modulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> signaling and ion transport by recruitment of kinases and phosphatases mediated by the regulatory protein IRBIT
<p>IRBIT is a multifunctional protein that controls the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of various epithelial ion transporters including NBCe1-B. Interaction with IRBIT increases NBCe1-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and exposes two cryptic Cl<sup>−</sup>-sensing GXXXP sites that enable regulation of NBCe1-B by intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>). Here, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that IRBIT controlled five phosphorylation sites in NBCe1-B that determined both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e conformation of the transporter and its regulation by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Mutational analysis suggested that the phosphorylation status of Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> was regulated by IRBIT and determined whether NBCe1 transporters are in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e or in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e conformations. The absence of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, or Ser<sup>235</sup> produced NBCe1-B in the conformations pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, or pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup>, respectively. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of the pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form was similar to that of IRBIT-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated NBCe1-B, but it was insensitive to inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. The properties of the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form were similar to those of wild-type NBCe1-B, whereas the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup> form was partially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e, further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by IRBIT, but retained inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Furthermore, IRBIT recruited the phosphatase PP1 and the kinase SPAK to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>65</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>32</sup>GXXXP<sup>36</sup> motif. IRBIT also recruited the phosphatase calcineurin and the kinase CaMKII to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>12</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>194</sup>GXXXP<sup>198</sup> motif. Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> are conserved in all NBCe1 variants and affect their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. These findings reveal how multiple kinase and phosphatase pathways use phosphorylation sites to fine-tune a transporter, which have important implications for epithelial fluid and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> secretion.</p>

Neuronal activity drives FMRP- and HSPG-dependent matrix metalloproteinase function required for rapid synaptogenesis
<p>Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) functions modulate synapse formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent plasticity. Aberrant MMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity is implicated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disease caused by the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP and characterized by neurological dysfunction and intellectual disability. Gene expression studies in <i>Drosophila</i> suggest that Mmps cooperate with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp) to restrict trans-synaptic Wnt signaling and that synaptogenic defects in the fly model of FXS are alleviated by either inhibition of Mmp or genetic reduction of Dlp. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) glutamatergic synapse to test <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent Dlp and Mmp intersections in the context of FXS. We found that rapid, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent synaptic bouton formation depended on secreted Mmp1. Acute neuronal stimulation reduced the abundance of Mmp2 but increased that of both Mmp1 and Dlp, as well as enhanced the colocalization of Dlp and Mmp1 at the synapse. Dlp function promoted Mmp1 abundance, localization, and proteolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity around synapses. Dlp glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains mediated this functional interaction with Mmp1. In the FXS fly model, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent increases in Mmp1 abundance and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity were lost but were restored by reducing the amount of synaptic Dlp. The data suggest that neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-induced, HSPG-dependent Mmp regulation drives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-dependent synaptogenesis and that this is impaired in FXS. Thus, exploring this mechanism further may reveal therapeutic targets that have the potential to restore synaptogenesis in FXS patients.</p>

The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 promotes T cell adhesion by activating the adaptor protein CrkII in the immunological synapse
<p>The adaptor protein CrkII regulates T cell adhesion by recruiting the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator of Rap1. Subsequently, Rap1 stimulates the integrin LFA-1, which leads to T cell adhesion and interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The adhesion of T cells to APCs is critical for their proper function and education. The interface between the T cell and the APC is known as the immunological synapse. It is characterized by the specific organization of proteins that can be divided into central supramolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation clusters (c-SMACs) and peripheral SMACs (p-SMACs). Through total internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reflect</span></strong>ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence (TIRF) microscopy and experiments with supported lipid bilayers, we determined that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated Rap1 was recruited to the immunological synapse and localized to the p-SMAC. C3G and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e (dephosphorylated) form of CrkII also localized to the same compartment. In contrast, in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e (phosphorylated) CrkII was confined to the c-SMAC. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of CrkII and its subsequent movement from the c-SMAC to the p-SMAC depended on the phosphatase SHP-1, which acted downstream of the T cell receptor. In the p-SMAC, CrkII recruited C3G, which led to Rap1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and LFA-1–mediated adhesion of T cells to APCs. Functionally, SHP-1 was necessary for both the adhesion and migration of T cells. Together, these data highlight a signaling pathway in which SHP-1 acts through CrkII to reshape the pattern of Rap1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in the immunological synapse.</p>

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet
<p>Stellar heating causes atmospheres of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape. These extended atmospheres are difficult to observe because their main spectral signature—neutral hydrogen at ultraviolet wavelengths—is strongly absorbed by interstellar medium. We report the detection of the near-infrared triplet of neutral helium in the transiting warm Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-11b by using ground-based, high-resolution observations. The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion depth of 1.08 ± 0.05%.

Imaging-based molecular barcoding with pixelated dielectric metasurfaces

We developed an imaging-based nanophotonic method for detecting mid-infrared molecular fingerprints and implemented it for the chemical identification and compositional analysis of surface-bound analytes. Our technique features a two-dimensional pixelated dielectric metasurface with a range of ultrasharp resonances, each tuned to a discrete frequency; this enables molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion signatures to be read out at multiple spectral points, and the resulting information is then translated into a barcode-like spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion map for imaging.

AIK1, A Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Modulates Abscisic Acid Responses through the MKK5-MPK6 Kinase Cascade<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction module involved in transducing extracellular signals to the nucleus for appropriate cellular adjustment. This cascade essentially consists of three components: a MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), a MAPK kinase, and a MAPK, connected to each other by the event of phosphorylation. Here, we report the characterization of a MAPKKK, ABA-INSENSITIVE PROTEIN KINASE1 (AIK1), which regulates abscisic acid (ABA) responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). T-DNA insertion mutants of AIK1 showed insensitivity to ABA in terms of both root growth and stomatal response. AIK1 functions in ABA responses via regulation of root cell division and elongation, as well as stomatal responses. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of AIK1 is induced by ABA in Arabidopsis and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>), and the Arabidopsis protein phosphatase type 2C, ABI1, a negative regulator of ABA signaling, restricts AIK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity by dephosphorylation. Bimolecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence complementation analysis showed that MPK3, MPK6, and AIK1 interact with MKK5. The single mutant seedlings of <i>mpk6</i> and <i>mkk5</i> have similar phenotypes to <i>aik1</i>, but <i>mkk4</i> does not. AIK1 was localized in the cytoplasm and shown to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate MKK5 by protein phosphorylation, which was an ABA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated process. Constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e MKK5 in <i>aik1</i> mutant seedlings complements the ABA-insensitive root growth phenotype of <i>aik1</i>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of MPK6 was increased by ABA in wild-type seedlings, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by ABA was impaired in <i>aik1</i> and <i>aik1 mkk5</i> mutants. These findings clearly suggest that the AIK1-MKK5-MPK6 cascade functions in the ABA regulation of primary root growth and stomatal response.</p>

Satellite cell activation and populations on single muscle-fiber cultures from adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)
<p>Satellite cells (SCs), stem cells in skeletal muscle, are mitotically quiescent in adult mammals until <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated for growth or regeneration. In mouse muscle, SCs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the mechanically induced NO–HGF signaling cascade. Here, the SC population on fibers from the adult, ectothermic zebrafish and SC responsiveness to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating stimuli were assessed using the model system of isolated fibers cultured at 27 and 21°C. SCs were identified by immunostaining for the HGF receptor, c-met, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine uptake in culture or <i>in vivo</i>. In dose–response studies, SC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation was increased by treatment with the NO-donor drug isosorbide dinitrate (1 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) or HGF (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) to maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation at lower concentrations of both than in previous studies of mouse fibers. HGF-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation was blocked by anti-c-met antibody, and reduced by culture at 21°C. The effect of cyclical stretch (3 h at 4 cycles per minute) increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and was blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibition and reduced by culture at 21°C. The number of c-met+ SCs per fiber increased rapidly (by 3 h) after stretching. The character of signaling in SC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation on zebrafish fibers, in particular temperature-dependent responses to HGF and stretch, gives new insights into the influence of ectothermy on regulation of muscle growth in teleosts and suggests the use of the single-fiber model system to explore the basis of fiber hyperplasia and the conservation of regulatory pathways between species.</p>

Exercise-Induced Changes in Glucose Metabolism Promote Physiological Cardiac Growth

In this study, we tested whether exercise-mediated changes in cardiomyocyte glucose metabolism are important for physiological cardiac growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used radiometric, immunologic, metabolomic, and biochemical assays to measure changes in myocardial glucose metabolism in mice subjected to acute and chronic treadmill exercise. To assess the relevance of changes in glycolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, we determined how cardiac-specific expression of mutant forms of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase affect cardiac structure, function, metabolism, and gene programs relevant to cardiac remodeling. Metabolomic and transcriptomic screenings were used to identify metabolic pathways and gene sets regulated by glycolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Exercise acutely decreased glucose utilization via glycolysis by modulating circulating substrates and reducing phosphofructokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity; however, in the recovered state following exercise adaptation, there was an increase in myocardial phosphofructokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and glycolysis. In mice, cardiac-specific expression of a kinase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase transgene (Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice) lowered glycolytic rate and regulated the expression of genes known to promote cardiac growth. Hearts of Glyco<sup>Lo</sup> mice had larger myocytes, enhanced cardiac function, and higher capillary-to-myocyte ratios. Expression of phosphatase-deficient 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase in the heart (Glyco<sup>Hi</sup> mice) increased glucose utilization and promoted a more pathological form of hypertrophy devoid of transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the physiological cardiac growth program. Modulation of phosphofructokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity was sufficient to regulate the glucose–fatty acid cycle in the heart; however, metabolic inflexibility caused by invariantly low or high phosphofructokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity caused modest mitochondrial damage.

Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity

Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and upregulated AT1 receptors and angiotensin-converting enzyme in P1 ECs.

Phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) links energy sensing to anti-inflammatory signaling
<p>Adenosine 5′-monophosphate–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinase (AMPK) is a pivotal regulator of metabolism at cellular and organismal levels. AMPK also suppresses inflammation. We found that pharmacological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of AMPK rapidly inhibited the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator of transcription (STAT) pathway in various cells. In vitro kinase assays revealed that AMPK directly phosphorylated two residues (Ser<sup>515</sup> and Ser<sup>518</sup>) within the Src homology 2 domain of JAK1. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of AMPK enhanced the interaction between JAK1 and 14-3-3 proteins in cultured vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts, an effect that required the presence of Ser<sup>515</sup> and Ser<sup>518</sup> and was abolished in cells lacking AMPK catalytic subunits. Mutation of Ser<sup>515</sup> and Ser<sup>518</sup> abolished AMPK-mediated inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling stimulated by either the sIL-6Rα/IL-6 complex or the expression of a constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e V658F-mutant JAK1 in human fibrosarcoma cells. Clinically used AMPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ators metformin and salicylate enhanced the inhibitory phosphorylation of endogenous JAK1 and inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in primary vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, our findings reveal a mechanism by which JAK1 function and inflammatory signaling may be suppressed in response to metabolic stress and provide a mechanistic rationale for the investigation of AMPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ators in a range of diseases associated with enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the JAK-STAT pathway.</p>

Transcriptional activation of elephant shark mineralocorticoid receptor by corticosteroids, progesterone, and spironolactone

The corticosteroid aldosterone is the physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator of the MR in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates; however, its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator is not known in cartilaginous fish, the oldest group of extant jawed vertebrates.

On the basis of their measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities, aldosterone, cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxcortisol, progesterone, and 19-norprogesterone are potential physiological mineralocorticoids. However, aldosterone, the physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, is not found in cartilaginous or ray-finned fish. Although progesterone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates MRs in ray-finned fish, progesterone does not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate MRs in humans, amphibians, or alligator, suggesting that during the transition to terrestrial vertebrates, progesterone lost the ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate the MR.

Manifold roles of β-arrestins in GPCR signaling elucidated with siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) use diverse mechanisms to regulate the mitogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated protein kinases ERK1/2. β-Arrestins (βArr1/2) are ubiquitous inhibitors of G protein signaling, promoting GPCR desensitization and internalization and serving as scaffolds for ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Studies using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete βArr1/2 and G proteins have cast doubt on the role of β-arrestins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating specific pools of ERK1/2. We compared the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of βArr1/2 and reconstitution with βArr1/2 in three different parental and CRISPR-derived βArr1/2 knockout HEK293 cell pairs to assess the effect of βArr1/2 deletion on ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by four G<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs. In all parental lines with all receptors, ERK1/2 stimulation was reduced by siRNAs specific for βArr2 or βArr1/2. In contrast, variable effects were observed with CRISPR-derived cell lines both between different lines and with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of different receptors. For β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors (β<sub>2</sub>ARs) and β<sub>1</sub>ARs, βArr1/2 deletion increased, decreased, or had no effect on isoproterenol-stimulated ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in different CRISPR clones. ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation by the vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> and follicle-stimulating hormone receptors was reduced in these cells but was enhanced by reconstitution with βArr1/2. Loss of desensitization and receptor internalization in CRISPR βArr1/2 knockout cells caused β<sub>2</sub>AR-mediated stimulation of ERK1/2 to become more dependent on G proteins, which was reversed by reintroducing βArr1/2. These data suggest that βArr1/2 function as a regulatory hub, determining the balance between mechanistically different pathways that result in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of ERK1/2, and caution against extrapolating results obtained from βArr1/2- or G protein–deleted cells to GPCR behavior in native systems.</p>

Allosteric inhibition of other Gα subunits was achieved by the introduction of an FR-binding site. In UM cells driven by constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα<sub>q</sub>, FR inhibited second messenger signaling, arrested cell proliferation, reinstated melanocytic differentiation, and stimulated apoptosis. In contrast, FR had no effect on <i>BRAF</i>-driven UM cells. FR promoted UM cell differentiation by re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)–mediated gene silencing, a heretofore unrecognized effector system of constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα<sub>q</sub> in UM. Constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα<sub>q</sub> and PRC2 therefore provide therapeutic targets for UM. The development of FR analogs specific for other Gα subunit subtypes may provide novel therapeutic approaches for diseases driven by constitutively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e Gα subunits or multiple G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) where targeting a single receptor is ineffective.</p>

SOCE mediated by STIM and Orai is essential for pacemaker activity in the interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract
<p>Electrical pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity generates phasic contractions and motility patterns such as segmentation and peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract. Pacemaker currents are generated in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores that stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated Cl<sup>−</sup> channels (CaCCs) in the plasma membrane. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores must be maintained to sustain pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) facilitates the refilling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by a mechanism dependent upon interactions between STIM and Orai proteins. We investigated the role of SOCE in ICC pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Reintroduction of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in store-depleted ICC resulted in CaCC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. Blocking CaCCs revealed an inwardly rectifying current with properties of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated current (<i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub>). An inhibitory peptide that interfered with the STIM-Orai interaction blocked <i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub> in HEK 293 cells expressing STIM1 and Orai1 and blocked spontaneous transient inward currents (STICs) and slow wave currents in ICC. STICs, which are fundamental pacemaker events in ICC, were blocked by an Orai antagonist. Imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients linked to pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in ICC in intact muscles showed that the Orai antagonist blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC. These data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> recovery through STIM-Orai interactions is necessary to maintain ICC pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity.</p>

VEGF–neuropilin-2 signaling promotes stem-like traits in breast cancer cells by TAZ-mediated repression of the Rac GAP β2-chimaerin
<p>The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in cancer is not only well known in the context of angiogenesis but also important in the functional regulation of tumor cells. Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating tumor growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating cancer patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of TAZ in various breast cancer cells, which mediated a positive feedback loop that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. In a complex with the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the gene encoding the Rac GTPase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating protein (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac signaling; hence, the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere formation. Analysis of a breast cancer patient database revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in tumors. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in a feed-forward loop of TAZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and the acquisition of CSC properties.</p>

Endogenous retinoid X receptor ligands in mouse hematopoietic cells
<p>The retinoid X receptor α (RXRA) has been implicated in diverse hematological processes. To identify natural ligands of RXRA that are present in hematopoietic cells, we adapted an upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation sequence–green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ent protein (UAS-GFP) reporter mouse to detect natural RXRA ligands in vivo. We observed reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in diverse types of hematopoietic cells in vivo. Reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity increased during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)–induced granulopoiesis and after phenylhydrazine (PHZ)–induced anemia, suggesting the presence of dynamically regulated natural RXRA ligands in hematopoietic cells. Mouse plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated Gal4-UAS reporter cells in vitro, and plasma from mice treated with G-CSF or PHZ recapitulated the patterns of reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation that we observed in vivo. Plasma from mice with dietary vitamin A deficiency only mildly reduced RXRA reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, whereas plasma from mice on a fatty acid restriction diet reduced reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, implicating fatty acids as plasma RXRA ligands. Through differential extraction coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified the long-chain fatty acid C24:5 as a natural RXRA ligand that was greatly increased in abundance in response to hematopoietic stress. Together, these data suggest that natural RXRA ligands are present and dynamically increased in abundance in mouse hematopoietic cells in vivo.</p>

Bacterial <sc>d</sc>-amino acids suppress sinonasal innate immunity through sweet taste receptors in solitary chemosensory cells
<p>In the upper respiratory epithelium, bitter and sweet taste receptors present in solitary chemosensory cells influence antimicrobial innate immune defense responses. Whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) stimulates surrounding epithelial cells to release antimicrobial peptides, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the sweet taste receptor (T1R) in the same cells inhibits this response. This mechanism is thought to control the magnitude of antimicrobial peptide release based on the sugar content of airway surface liquid. We hypothesized that <sc>d</sc>-amino acids, which are produced by various bacteria and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate T1R in taste receptor cells in the mouth, may also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate T1R in the airway. We showed that both the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits of the sweet taste receptor (T1R2/3) were present in the same chemosensory cells of primary human sinonasal epithelial cultures. Respiratory isolates of <i>Staphylococcus</i> species, but not <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, produced at least two <sc>d</sc>-amino acids that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate the sweet taste receptor.

Activation of master virulence regulator PhoP in acidic pH requires the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL
<p>Acidic conditions, such as those inside phagosomes, stimulate the intracellular pathogen <i>Salmonella enterica</i> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate virulence genes. The sensor PhoQ responds to a mildly acidic pH by phosphorylating, and thereby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating, the virulence regulator PhoP. This PhoP/PhoQ two-component system is conserved in a subset of Gram-negative bacteria. PhoQ is thought to be sufficient to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate PhoP in mildly acidic pH. However, we found that the <i>Salmonella</i>-specific protein UgtL, which was horizontally acquired by <i>Salmonella</i> before the divergence of <i>S. enterica</i> and <i>Salmonella bongori</i>, was also necessary for PhoQ to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate PhoP under mildly acidic pH conditions but not for PhoQ to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate PhoP in response to low Mg<sup>2+</sup> or the antimicrobial peptide C18G. UgtL increased the abundance of phosphorylated PhoP by stimulating autophosphorylation of PhoQ, thereby increasing the amount of the phosphodonor for PhoP. Deletion of <i>ugtL</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated <i>Salmonella</i> virulence and further reduced PhoP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in a strain bearing a form of PhoQ that is not responsive to acidic pH. These data suggest that when <i>Salmonella</i> experiences mildly acidic pH, PhoP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation requires PhoQ to detect pH and UgtL to amplify the PhoQ response. Our findings reveal how acquisition of a foreign gene can strengthen signal responsiveness in an ancestral regulatory system.</p>

In silico modeling identifies CD45 as a regulator of IL-2 synergy in the NKG2D-mediated activation of immature human NK cells
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells perform immunosurveillance of virally infected and transformed cells, and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation depends on the balance between signaling by inhibitory and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating receptors. Cytokine receptor signaling can synergize with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating receptor signaling to induce NK cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. We investigated the interplay between the signaling pathways stimulated by the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating receptor NKG2D in immature (CD56<sup>bright</sup>) and mature (CD56<sup>dim</sup>) subsets of human primary NK cells using mass cytometry experiments and in silico modeling. Our analysis revealed that IL-2 changed the abundances of several key proteins, including NKG2D and the phosphatase CD45. Furthermore, we found differences in correlations between protein abundances, which were associated with the maturation state of the NK cells. The mass cytometry measurements also revealed that the signaling kinetics of key protein abundances induced by NKG2D stimulation depended on the maturation state and the pretreatment condition of the NK cells. Our in silico model, which described the multidimensional data with coupled first-order reactions, predicted that the increase in CD45 abundance was a major enhancer of NKG2D-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells but not in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells. This dependence on CD45 was verified by measurement of CD107a mobilization to the NK cell surface (a marker of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation).

Functional degradation: A mechanism of NLRP1 inflammasome activation by diverse pathogen enzymes
<p>Inflammasomes are multiprotein platforms that initiate innate immunity by recruitment and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of caspase-1. The NLRP1B inflammasome is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated upon direct cleavage by the anthrax lethal toxin protease. However, the mechanism by which cleavage results in NLRP1B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation is unknown. In this study, we find that cleavage results in proteasome-mediated degradation of the amino-terminal domains of NLRP1B, liberating a carboxyl-terminal fragment that is a potent caspase-1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator. Proteasome-mediated degradation of NLRP1B is both necessary and sufficient for NLRP1B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation.

A molecular assembly phase transition and kinetic proofreading modulate Ras activation by SOS
<p>The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Son of Sevenless (SOS) is a key Ras <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator that is autoinhibited in the cytosol and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates upon membrane recruitment. Autoinhibition release involves structural rearrangements of the protein at the membrane and thus introduces a delay between initial recruitment and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. In this study, we designed a single-molecule assay to resolve the time between initial receptor-mediated membrane recruitment and the initiation of GEF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of individual SOS molecules on microarrays of Ras-functionalized supported membranes. The rise-and-fall shape of the measured SOS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation time distribution and the long mean time scale to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation (~50 seconds) establish a basis for kinetic proofreading in the receptor-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Ras.

Lysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging

The MAPK Kinase Kinase GmMEKK1 Regulates Cell Death and Defense Responses
<p>MAPK signaling pathways play critical roles in plant immunity. Here, we silenced multiple genes encoding MAPKs using virus-induced gene silencing mediated by <i>Bean pod mottle virus</i> to identify MAPK genes involved in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) immunity. Surprisingly, a strong hypersensitive response (HR) cell death was observed when soybean <i>MAPK KINASE KINASE1</i> (<i>GmMEKK1</i>), a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>MEKK1</i>, was silenced. The HR was accompanied by the overaccumulation of defense signaling molecules, salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide. Genes involved in primary metabolism, translation/transcription, photosynthesis, and growth/development were down-regulated in <i>GmMEKK1-</i>silenced plants, while the expression of defense-related genes was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated. Accordingly, <i>GmMEKK1</i>-silenced plants were more resistant to downy mildew (<i>Peronospora manshurica</i>) and <i>Soybean mosaic virus</i> compared with control plants. Silencing <i>GmMEKK1</i> reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of GmMPK6 but enhanced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of <i>Gm</i>MPK3 in response to flg22 peptide. Unlike Arabidopsis MPK4, <i>Gm</i>MPK4 was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated by either flg22 or SA. Interestingly, transient overexpression of <i>GmMEKK1</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> also induced HR. Our results indicate that <i>Gm</i>MEKK1 plays both positive and negative roles in immunity and appears to differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate downstream MPKs by promoting <i>Gm</i>MPK6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation but suppressing GmMPK3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation in response to flg22.

Development
Co-activation of microRNAs by Zelda is essential for early <i>Drosophila</i> development
<p>Transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs) are two important classes of <i>trans</i>-regulators in differential gene expression. Transcription factors occupy <i>cis</i>-regulatory motifs in DNA to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate or repress gene transcription, whereas miRNAs specifically pair with seed sites in target mRNAs to trigger mRNA decay or inhibit translation. Dynamic spatiotemporal expression patterns of transcription factors and miRNAs during development point to their stage- and tissue-specific functions. Recent studies have focused on miRNA functions during development; however, much remains to explore regarding how the expression of miRNAs is initiated and how dynamic miRNA expression patterns are achieved by transcriptional regulatory networks at different developmental stages. Here, we focused on the identification, regulation and function of miRNAs during the earliest stage of <i>Drosophila</i> development, when the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) takes place. Eleven miRNA clusters comprise the first set of miRNAs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated in the blastoderm embryo. The transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator Zelda is required for their proper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation and regulation, and Zelda binding observed in genome-wide binding profiles is predictive of enhancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. In addition, other blastoderm transcription factors, comprising both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ators and repressors, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities of which are potentiated and coordinated by Zelda, contribute to the accurate temporal and spatial expression of these miRNAs, which are known to function in diverse developmental processes. Although previous genetic studies showed no early phenotypes upon loss of individual miRNAs, our analysis of the <i>miR-1; miR-9a</i> double mutant revealed defects in gastrulation, demonstrating the importance of co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of miRNAs by Zelda during the MZT.</p>

<p>Catalytically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating mutations in <i>Ptpn11</i>, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, cause 50% of Noonan syndrome (NS) cases, whereas in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating mutations in <i>Ptpn11</i> are responsible for nearly all cases of the similar, but distinct, developmental disorder Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML; formerly called LEOPARD syndrome). However, both types of disease mutations are gain-of-function mutations because they cause SHP2 to constitutively adopt an open conformation. We found that the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of SHP2 was required for the pathogenic effects of gain-of-function, disease-associated mutations on the development of hydrocephalus in the mouse. Targeted pan-neuronal knockin of a <i>Ptpn11</i> allele encoding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e SHP2 E76K mutant resulted in hydrocephalus due to aberrant development of ependymal cells and their cilia. These pathogenic effects of the E76K mutation were suppressed by the additional mutation C459S, which abolished the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of SHP2. Moreover, ependymal cells in NSML mice bearing the in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e SHP2 mutant Y279C were also unaffected.

Membrane depolarization also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates large-conductance calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated potassium (BK) channels, which limits Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity that promotes vasoconstriction, thus leading to vasodilation. We showed that in human and rat arterial myocytes, membrane depolarization rapidly increased the cell surface abundance of auxiliary BK β1 subunits but not that of the pore-forming BKα channels. Membrane depolarization stimulated voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Rho kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2. ROCK1/2-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of Rab11A promoted the delivery of β1 subunits to the plasma membrane by Rab11A-positive recycling endosomes. These additional β1 subunits associated with BKα channels already at the plasma membrane, leading to an increase in apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the channels in pressurized arterial myocytes and vasodilation. Thus, membrane depolarization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ates BK channels through stimulation of ROCK- and Rab11A-dependent trafficking of β1 subunits to the surface of arterial myocytes.</p>

Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>–EP2–NF-κB signaling in macrophages as a potential therapeutic target for intracranial aneurysms
<p>Intracranial aneurysms are common but are generally untreated, and their rupture can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Because of the poor prognosis associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage, preventing the progression of intracranial aneurysms is critically important. Intracranial aneurysms are caused by chronic inflammation of the arterial wall due to macrophage infiltration triggered by monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation mediated by the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and inflammatory signaling involving prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) and prostaglandin E receptor subtype 2 (EP2). We correlated EP2 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) with macrophage infiltration in human intracranial aneurysm lesions. Monitoring the spatiotemporal pattern of NF-κB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation during intracranial aneurysm development in mice showed that NF-κB was first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated in macrophages in the adventitia and in endothelial cells and, subsequently, in the entire arterial wall. Mice with a macrophage-specific deletion of <i>Ptger2</i> (which encodes EP2) or macrophage-specific expression of an IκBα mutant that restricts NF-κB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation had fewer intracranial aneurysms with reduced macrophage infiltration and NF-κB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. In cultured cells, EP2 signaling cooperated with tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate NF-κB and synergistically induce the expression of proinflammatory genes, including <i>Ptgs2</i> (encoding COX-2). EP2 signaling also stabilized <i>Ccl2</i> (encoding MCP-1) by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating the RNA-stabilizing protein HuR. Rats administered an EP2 antagonist had reduced macrophage infiltration and intracranial aneurysm formation and progression. This signaling pathway in macrophages thus facilitates intracranial aneurysm development by amplifying inflammation in intracranial arteries. These results indicate that EP2 antagonists may therefore be a therapeutic alternative to surgery.</p>

The tyrosine kinase Src promotes phosphorylation of the kinase TBK1 to facilitate type I interferon production after viral infection
<p>Various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ated in response to viral infection to stimulate the production of type I interferons (IFNs). However, central to the responses of all of these receptors is their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of the kinase TBK1, which stimulates transcription by IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). We investigated the mechanism by which the kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of TBK1 is stimulated in response to viral infection. We found that the tyrosine kinase Src promoted the phosphorylation of TBK1 on Tyr<sup>179</sup> upon viral infection of RAW264.7 macrophages. Mutation of Tyr<sup>179</sup> to alanine resulted in impaired autophosphorylation of TBK1 at Ser<sup>172</sup>, which is required for TBK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. The TBK1 Y179A mutant failed to rescue type I IFN production by virally infected RAW264.7 macrophages deficient in TBK1. Pharmacological inhibition of Src with AZD0530 and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9–mediated knockout of Src demonstrated that Src was critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating the TBK1-IRF3 pathway and stimulating type I IFN production. However, Src did not directly bind to recombinant TBK1 in vitro but instead bound to the proline-X-X-proline motifs within key PRR adaptor proteins, such as TRIF, MAVS, and STING, which formed complexes with TBK1 after PRR engagement. Together, our data suggest that Src is the major tyrosine kinase that primes TBK1 for autophosphorylation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation, thus providing mechanistic insights into the regulation of TBK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity by various PRRs as part of the innate antiviral response.</p>

Embryonic neural activity wires the brain
<p>The development of many sensory systems commonly involves patterned spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity of neurons, in which nearby neurons fire synchronously, forming waves of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity that propagate throughout a neural circuit. In concert with sensory experience and molecular factors, patterned spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity is critical for the formation of sensory maps, which are spatial representations in the brain of the sensory features they encode. The initial establishment of sensory maps is thought to be driven by molecular cues and later refined by neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, initially through patterned spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and later by sensory-evoked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. On page 987 of this issue, Antón-Bolaños <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) use the mouse whisker system to show that at the earliest stages of innervation to the cortex during brain development, patterned spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity is required for the formation of functional sensory maps.</p>

Structural basis of bacterial transcription activation
<p>In bacteria, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of gene transcription at many promoters is simple and only involves a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator. The cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate receptor protein (CAP), a classic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ator, is able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate transcription independently through two different mechanisms. Understanding the class I mechanism requires an intact transcription <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation complex (TAC) structure at a high resolution. Here we report a high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structure of an intact <i>Escherichia coli</i> class I TAC containing a CAP dimer, a σ<sup>70</sup>–RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme, a complete class I CAP-dependent promoter DNA, and a de novo synthesized RNA oligonucleotide. The structure shows how CAP wraps the upstream DNA and how the interactions recruit RNAP. Our study provides a structural basis for understanding how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ators <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ate transcription through the class I recruitment mechanism.</p>

PI3K pathway regulates ER-dependent transcription in breast cancer through the epigenetic regulator KMT2D
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ating mutations in <i>PIK3CA</i>, the gene encoding phosphoinositide-(3)-kinase α (PI3Kα), are frequently found in estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer. PI3Kα inhibitors, now in late-stage clinical development, elicit a robust compensatory increase in ER-dependent transcription that limits therapeutic efficacy. We investigated the chromatin-based mechanisms leading to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of ER upon PI3Kα inhibition. We found that PI3Kα inhibition mediates an open chromatin state at the ER target loci in breast cancer models and clinical samples. KMT2D, a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, is required for FOXA1, PBX1, and ER recruitment and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation. AKT binds and phosphorylates KMT2D, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ating methyltransferase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and ER function, whereas PI3Kα inhibition enhances KMT2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. These findings uncover a mechanism that controls the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of ER by the posttranslational modification of epigenetic regulators, providing a rationale for epigenetic therapy in ER-positive breast cancer.</p>

Time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy with a water window high-harmonic source
<p>Time-resolved x-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion spectroscopy (TR-XAS) has so far practically been limited to large-scale facilities, to subpicosecond temporal resolution, and to the condensed phase. We report the realization of TR-XAS with a temporal resolution in the low femtosecond range by developing a tabletop high-harmonic source reaching up to 350 electron volts, thus partially covering the spectral region of 280 to 530 electron volts, where water is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ive. We used this source to follow previously unexamined light-induced chemical reactions in the lowest electronic states of isolated CF<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and SF<sub>6</sub><sup>+</sup> molecules in the gas phase. By probing element-specific core-to-valence transitions at the carbon K-edge or the sulfur L-edges, we characterized their reaction paths and observed the effect of symmetry breaking through the splitting of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>ion bands and Rydberg-valence mixing induced by the geometry changes.</p>

The SUMO Conjugation Complex Self-Assembles into Nuclear Bodies Independent of SIZ1 and COP1
<p>Attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to substrate proteins modulates their turnover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, or interaction partners. However, how this SUMO conjugation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity concentrates the proteins involved and the substrates into uncharacterized nuclear bodies (NBs) remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized the requirements for SUMO NB formation and for their subsequent colocalization with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), a master regulator of plant growth. COP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity results in degradation of transcription factors, which primes the transcriptional response that underlies elongation growth induced by darkness and high ambient temperatures (skoto- and thermomorphogenesis, respectively). SUMO conjugation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity alone was sufficient to target the SUMO machinery into NBs. Colocalization of these bodies with COP1 required, in addition to SUMO conjugation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, a SUMO acceptor site in COP1 and the SUMO E3 ligase SAP and Miz 1 (SIZ1). We found that SIZ1 docks in the substrate-binding pocket of COP1 via two valine-proline peptide motifs, which represent a known interaction motif of COP1 substrates. The data reveal that SIZ1 physically connects COP1 and SUMO conjugation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity in the same NBs that can also contain the blue-light receptors CRYPTOCHROME 1 and CRYPTOCHROME 2. Our findings thus suggest that sumoylation stimulates COP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity within NBs. Moreover, the presence of SIZ1 and SUMO in these NBs explains how both the timing and amplitude of the high-temperature growth response is controlled. The strong colocalization of COP1 and SUMO in these NBs might also explain why many COP1 substrates are sumoylated.</p>

Multiplex Fluorescent, Activity-Based Protein Profiling Identifies Active α-Glycosidases and Other Hydrolases in Plants
<p>With nearly 140 α-glycosidases in 14 different families, plants are well equipped with enzymes that can break the α-glucosidic bonds in a large diversity of molecules. Here, we introduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity-based protein profiling (ABPP) of α-glycosidases in plants using α-configured cyclophellitol aziridine probes carrying various fluorophores or biotin. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), these probes label members of the GH31 family of glycosyl hydrolases, including endoplasmic reticulum-resident α-glucosidase-II Radial Swelling3/Priority for Sweet Life5 (RSW3/PSL5) and Golgi-resident α-mannosidase-II Hybrid Glycosylation1 (HGL1), both of which trim <i>N</i>-glycans on glycoproteins. We detected the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e state of extracellular α-glycosidases such as α-xylosidase XYL1, which acts on xyloglucans in the cell wall to promote cell expansion, and α-glucosidase AGLU1, which acts in starch hydrolysis and can suppress fungal invasion. Labeling of α-glycosidases generates pH-dependent signals that can be suppressed by α-glycosidase inhibitors in a broad range of plant species. To demonstrate its use on a nonmodel plant species, we applied ABPP on saffron crocus (<i>Crocus sativus</i>), a cash crop for the production of saffron spice. Using a combination of biotinylated glycosidase probes, we identified and quantified 67 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e glycosidases in saffron crocus stigma, of which 10 are differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e. We also uncovered massive changes in hydrolase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ities in the corms upon infection with <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> using multiplex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluoresc</span></strong>ence labeling in combination with probes for serine hydrolases and cysteine proteases. These experiments demonstrate the ease with which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>e α-glycosidases and other hydrolases can be analyzed through ABPP in model and nonmodel plants.</p>

Converging Light, Energy and Hormonal Signaling Control Meristem Activity, Leaf Initiation, and Growth<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>The development of leaf primordia is subject to light control of meristematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity. Light regulates the expression of thousands of genes with roles in cell proliferation, organ development, and differentiation of photosynthetic cells. Previous work has highlighted roles for hormone homeostasis and the energy-dependent Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase in meristematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity, yet a picture of how these two regulatory mechanisms depend on light perception and interact with each other has yet to emerge. Their relevance beyond leaf initiation also is unclear. Here, we report the discovery that the dark-arrested meristematic region of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) experiences a local energy deprivation state and confirm previous findings that the PIN1 auxin transporter is diffusely localized in the dark. Light triggers a rapid removal of the starvation state and the establishment of PIN1 polar membrane localization consistent with auxin export, both preceding the induction of cell cycle- and cytoplasmic growth-associated genes. We demonstrate that shoot meristematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity can occur in the dark through the manipulation of auxin and cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity as well as through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ation of energy signaling, both targets of photomorphogenesis action, but the organ developmental outcomes differ: while TOR-dependent energy signals alone stimulate cell proliferation, the development of a normal leaf lamina requires photomorphogenesis-like hormonal responses. We further show that energy signaling adjusts the extent of cell cycle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">activ</span></strong>ity and growth of young leaves non-cellautonomously to available photosynthates and leads to organs constituted of a greater number of cells developing under higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ance. This makes energy signaling perhaps the most important biomass growth determinant under natural, unstressed conditions.</p>

A <i>Magnaporthe</i> Chitinase Interacts with a Rice Jacalin-Related Lectin to Promote Host Colonization
<p>The genome of rice blast fungus (<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>) encodes 15 glycoside hydrolase 18 family <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chitin</span></strong>ases. In this study, we characterized the function of an <i>M. oryzae</i> extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chitin</span></strong>ase, MoChi1, and its interaction with a host protein, OsMBL1, a jacalin-related Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Deletion of <i>MoChi1</i> resulted in reduced aerial hyphal formation and reduced virulence in rice by activating the expression of defense-responsive genes. We confirmed MoChi1 interaction with rice OsMBL1 in vitro and in vivo. <i>OsMBL1</i> was induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and <i>M. oryzae</i> infection. Overexpression of <i>OsMBL1</i> led to activation of rice defense-responsive genes and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chitin</span></strong>-induced reactive oxygen species burst, thereby enhancing resistance to <i>M. oryzae</i>. Knockdown of <i>OsMBL1</i> enhances susceptibility of rice plants to <i>M. oryzae</i>. Furthermore, MoChi1 suppressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chitin</span></strong>-induced reactive oxygen species in rice cells and competed with OsMBL1 for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chitin</span></strong> binding. Taken together, our study reveals a mechanism in which MoChi1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>gets a host lectin to suppress rice immunity.</p>

Roles of Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase VII Members in Pattern-Triggered Immune Signaling
<p>Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which consist of receptor kinases (RKs) and receptor-like proteins, sense microbe- and host-derived molecular patterns associated with pathogen infection to trigger immune responses in plants. Several kinases of the 46-member Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamily VII play important roles in pattern-triggered immunity, but it is unclear whether different RLCK VII members act specifically or redundantly in immune signaling. Here, we constructed nine higher order mutants of this subfamily (named <i>rlck vii-1</i> to <i>rlck vii-9</i>) and systematically characterized their immune phenotypes. The mutants <i>rlck vii-5</i>, -<i>7</i>, and -<i>8</i> had compromised reactive oxygen species production in response to all patterns tested, indicating that the corresponding members are broadly required for the signaling of multiple PRRs. However, <i>rlck vii-4</i> was defective specifically in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chitin</span></strong>-induced reactive oxygen species production, suggesting that RCLK VII-4 members mediate the signaling of specific PRRs. Furthermore, RLCK VII-4 members were required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chitin</span></strong>-triggered activation of MAPK, demonstrating that these kinases link a PRR to MAPK activation. Moreover, we found that RLCK VII-6 and -8 also were required for RK-mediated root growth. Together, these results show that numerous RLCK VII members are involved in pattern-triggered immune signaling and uncover both common and specific roles of these kinases in plant development and immunity mediated by various RKs.</p>

Second messenger–mediated tactile response by a bacterial rotary motor
<p>When bacteria encounter surfaces, they respond with surface colonization and virulence induction. The mechanisms of bacterial mechanosensation and downstream signaling remain poorly understood. Here, we describe a tactile sensing cascade in <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> in which the flagellar motor acts as sensor. Surface-induced motor interference stimulated the production of the second messenger cyclic diguanylate by the motor-associated diguanylate cyclase DgcB. This led to the allosteric activation of the glycosyltransferase HfsJ to promote rapid synthesis of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>e adhesin and surface anchoring. Although the membrane-embedded motor unit was essential for surface sensing, mutants that lack external flagellar structures were hypersensitive to mechanical stimuli. Thus, the bacterial flagellar motor acts as a tetherless sensor reminiscent of mechanosensitive channels.</p>

Polyploidy Affects Plant Growth and Alters Cell Wall Composition
<p>Polyploidization has played a key role in plant breeding and crop improvement. Although its potential to increase biomass yield is well described, the effect of polyploidization on biomass composition has largely remained unexplored. Here, we generated a series of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants with different somatic ploidy levels (2n, 4n, 6n, and 8n) and performed rigorous phenotypic characterization. Kinematic analysis showed that polyploids developed slower compared to diploids; however, tetra- and hexaploids, but not octaploids, generated larger rosettes due to delayed flowering. In addition, morphometric analysis of leaves showed that polyploidy affected epidermal pavement cells, with increased cell size and reduced cell number per leaf blade with incrementing ploidy. However, the inflorescence stem dry weight was highest in tetraploids. Cell wall characterization revealed that the basic somatic ploidy level negatively correlated with lignin and cellulose content, and positively correlated with matrix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>e content (i.e. hemicellulose and pectin) in the stem tissue. In addition, higher ploidy plants displayed altered sugar composition. Such effects were linked to the delayed development of polyploids. Moreover, the changes in polyploid cell wall composition promoted saccharification yield. The results of this study indicate that induction of polyploidy is a promising breeding strategy to further tailor crops for biomass production.</p>

A Trihelix Family Transcription Factor Is Associated with Key Genes in Mixed-Linkage Glucan Accumulation
<p>Mixed-linkage glucan (MLG) is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>e that is highly abundant in grass endosperm cell walls and present at lower amounts in other tissues. <i>Cellulose synthase-like F</i> (<i>CSLF</i>) and <i>cellulose synthase-like H</i> genes synthesize MLG, but it is unknown if other genes participate in the production and restructuring of MLG. Using <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> transcriptional profiling data, we identified a <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> trihelix family transcription factor (<i>BdTHX1</i>) that is highly coexpressed with the <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon CSLF6</i> gene (<i>BdCSLF6</i>), which suggests that BdTHX1 is involved in the regulation of MLG biosynthesis. To determine the genes regulated by this transcription factor, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments using immature <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> seeds and an anti-BdTHX1 polyclonal antibody. The ChIP-seq experiment identified the second intron of <i>BdCSLF6</i> as one of the most enriched sequences. The binding of BdTHX1 to the <i>BdCSLF6</i> intron sequence was confirmed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). ChIP-seq also showed that a gene encoding a grass-specific glycoside hydrolase family 16 endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (<i>BdXTH8</i>) is bound by BdTHX1, and the binding was confirmed by EMSA. Radiochemical transglucanase assays showed that BdXTH8 exhibits predominantly MLG:xyloglucan endotransglucosylase activity, a hetero-transglycosylation reaction, and can thus produce MLG-xyloglucan covalent bonds; it also has a lower xyloglucan:xyloglucan endotransglucosylase activity. <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> shoots regenerated from transformed calli overexpressing <i>BdTHX1</i> showed an abnormal arrangement of vascular tissue and seedling-lethal phenotypes. These results indicate that the transcription factor BdTHX1 likely plays an important role in MLG biosynthesis and restructuring by regulating the expression of <i>BdCSLF6</i> and <i>BdXTH8</i>.</p>

The Patterned Structure of Galactoglucomannan Suggests It May Bind to Cellulose in Seed Mucilage
<p>The interaction between mannan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>es and cellulose microfibrils contributes to cell wall properties in some vascular plants, but the molecular arrangement of mannan in the cell wall and the nature of the molecular bonding between mannan and cellulose remain unknown. Previous studies have shown that mannan is important in maintaining Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed mucilage architecture, and that Cellulose Synthase-Like A2 (CSLA2) synthesizes a glucomannan backbone, which Mannan α-Galactosyl Transferase1 (MAGT1/GlycosylTransferase-Like6/Mucilage Related10) might decorate with single α-Gal branches. Here, we investigated the ratio and sequence of Man and Glc and the arrangement of Gal residues in Arabidopsis mucilage mannan using enzyme sequential digestion, carbohydrate gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry. We found that seed mucilage galactoglucomannan has a backbone consisting of the repeating disaccharide [4)-β-Glc-(1,4)-β-Man-(1,], and most of the Man residues in the backbone are substituted by single α-1,6-Gal. CSLA2 is responsible for the synthesis of this patterned glucomannan backbone and MAGT1 catalyses the addition of α-Gal. In vitro activity assays revealed that MAGT1 transferred α-Gal from UDP-Gal only to Man residues within the CSLA2 patterned glucomannan backbone acceptor. These results indicate that CSLAs and galactosyltransferases are able to make precisely defined galactoglucomannan structures. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested this patterned galactoglucomannan is able to bind stably to some hydrophilic faces and to hydrophobic faces of cellulose microfibrils. A specialization of the biosynthetic machinery to make galactoglucomannan with a patterned structure may therefore regulate the mode of binding of this hemicellulose to cellulose fibrils.</p>

Revised Phylogeny of the <i>Cellulose Synthase</i> Gene Superfamily: Insights into Cell Wall Evolution
<p>Cell walls are crucial for the integrity and function of all land plants and are of central importance in human health, livestock production, and as a source of renewable bioenergy. Many enzymes that mediate the biosynthesis of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>es are encoded by members of the large <i>cellulose synthase</i> (<i>CesA</i>) gene superfamily. Here, we analyzed 29 sequenced genomes and 17 transcriptomes to revise the phylogeny of the <i>CesA</i> gene superfamily in angiosperms. Our results identify ancestral gene clusters that predate the monocot-eudicot divergence and reveal several novel evolutionary observations, including the expansion of the Poaceae-specific cellulose synthase-like <i>CslF</i> family to the graminids and restiids and the characterization of a previously unreported eudicot lineage, <i>CslM</i>, that forms a reciprocally monophyletic eudicot-monocot grouping with the <i>CslJ</i> clade. The <i>CslM</i> lineage is widely distributed in eudicots, and the <i>CslJ</i> clade, which was thought previously to be restricted to the Poales, is widely distributed in monocots. Our analyses show that some members of the <i>CslJ</i> lineage, but not the newly identified <i>CslM</i> genes, are capable of directing (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan biosynthesis, which, contrary to current dogma, is not restricted to Poaceae.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>get Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer drought resistance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in rice, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these plants exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by rice plants under drought stress. The leaves of STTM166 rice plants had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 plants had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified rice <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>get of miR166; moreover, rice plants overexpressing a miR166-resistant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 plants, including leaf rolling and higher drought resistance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>e synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that drought resistance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic plants’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

A Poly(A) Ribonuclease Controls the Cellotriose-Based Interaction between <i>Piriformospora indica</i> and Its Host Arabidopsis
<p><i>Piriformospora indica</i>, an endophytic root-colonizing fungus, efficiently promotes plant growth and induces resistance to abiotic stress and biotic diseases. <i>P. indica</i> fungal cell wall extract induces cytoplasmic calcium elevation in host plant roots. Here, we show that cellotriose (CT) is an elicitor-active cell wall moiety released by <i>P. indica</i> into the medium. CT induces a mild defense-like response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, changes in membrane potential, and the expression of genes involved in growth regulation and root development. CT-based cytoplasmic calcium elevation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots does not require the BAK1 coreceptor or the putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels TPC1, GLR3.3, GLR2.4, and GLR2.5 and operates synergistically with the elicitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chitin</span></strong>. We identified an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant (<i>cytoplasmic</i> <i>calcium elevation mutant</i>) impaired in the response to CT and various other cellooligomers (<i>n</i> = 2–7), but not to chitooligomers (<i>n</i> = 4–8), in roots. The mutant contains a single nucleotide exchange in the gene encoding a poly(A) ribonuclease (AtPARN; At1g55870) that degrades the poly(A) tails of specific mRNAs. The wild-type <i>PARN</i> cDNA, expressed under the control of a 35S promoter, complements the mutant phenotype. Our identification of cellotriose as a novel chemical mediator casts light on the complex <i>P. indica</i>-plant mutualistic relationship.</p>

Pollen-Expressed Leucine-Rich Repeat Extensins Are Essential for Pollen Germination and Growth
<p>During pollen tube growth, the walls of the tube provide the mechanical strength resisting turgor pressure to protect two sperm cells. Cell wall proteins may play an important role in this process. Pollen tube cell wall proteins known as leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) harbor a leucine-rich repeat domain and an extensin domain. In this study, the functions of four pollen-expressed LRXs, LRX8, LRX9, LRX10, and LRX11 (LRX8–11), were characterized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>LRX8–11</i> displayed a consistent expression pattern in mature pollen grains and pollen tubes. In a phenotypic analysis of four single mutants, six double mutants, four triple mutants, and a quadruple mutant, the triple and quadruple mutant plants displayed markedly reduced seed set and decreased male transmission efficiency accompanied by compromised pollen germination and pollen tube growth. GFP-fused LRX8, LRX10, and LRX11 were found to be localized to pollen tube cell walls. An immunohistochemical analysis of pollen tube cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>es showed an increase in the amount of rhamnogalacturonan I in the subapical walls of pollen tubes of the <i>lrx9 lrx10 lrx11</i> and <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutants and a decrease in the content of fucosylated xyloglucans in <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> compared with wild-type plants. Moreover, the callose content in the apical walls of pollen tubes increased in the <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutant. In conclusion, we propose that LRX8–11 function synergistically to maintain pollen tube cell wall integrity; thus, they play critical roles in pollen germination and pollen tube growth.</p>

Branched Pectic Galactan in Phloem-Sieve-Element Cell Walls: Implications for Cell Mechanics
<p>A major question in plant biology concerns the specification and functional differentiation of cell types. This is in the context of constraints imposed by networks of cell walls that both adhere cells and contribute to the form and function of developing organs. Here, we report the identification of a glycan epitope that is specific to phloem sieve element cell walls in several systems. A monoclonal antibody, designated LM26, binds to the cell wall of phloem sieve elements in stems of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>Miscanthus</i> x <i>giganteus</i>, and notably sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>) roots where phloem identification is an important factor for the study of phloem unloading of Suc. Using microarrays of synthetic oligosaccharides, the LM26 epitope has been identified as a β-1,6-galactosyl substitution of β-1,4-galactan requiring more than three backbone residues for optimized recognition. This branched galactan structure has previously been identified in garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) bulbs in which the LM26 epitope is widespread throughout most cell walls including those of phloem cells. Garlic bulb cell wall material has been used to confirm the association of the LM26 epitope with cell wall pectic rhamnogalacturonan-I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>es. In the phloem tissues of grass stems, the LM26 epitope has a complemen<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>y pattern to that of the LM5 linear β-1,4-galactan epitope, which is detected only in companion cell walls. Mechanical probing of transverse sections of <i>M</i>. x <i>giganteus</i> stems and leaves by atomic force microscopy indicates that phloem sieve element cell walls have a lower indentation modulus (indicative of higher elasticity) than companion cell walls.</p>

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with elongation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial gradients for elongation rate, osmotic pressure, cell wall thickness, and wall mechanical compliances and coupled these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>e composition, mobility, hydration, and intermolecular interactions of the inflorescence cell wall using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering. Force-extension curves revealed a gradient, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-scattering curves showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, hydration, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal gradient in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

Our results reveal the binding epitopes for 78 arabinogalactan-, rhamnogalacturonan-, xylan-, and xyloglucan-directed antibodies.

<p>Controlling the major auxin biosynthetic pathway to manipulate auxin content could be a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>get for genetic engineering of crops with desired traits, but little progress had been made because low or high auxin contents often cause developmental inhibition. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) to identify the Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1/Tryptophan Aminotransferase-Related (TAA1/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>) genes that function in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of auxin biosynthesis. Sequence mining together with gene cloning identified 15 <i>Ta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong></i> genes, among which 12 and three genes were phylogenetically close to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) At<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>2 and At<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>3, respectively. <i>Ta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>2.1</i> had the most abundant transcripts in the <i>Ta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>2</i> genes and was expressed mainly in roots and up-regulated by low nitrogen (N) availability. Knockdown of <i>Ta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>2.1</i> caused vegetative and reproductive deficiencies and impaired lateral root (LR) growth under both high- and low-N conditions. Overexpressing <i>Ta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>2.1-3A</i> in wheat enhanced LR branching, plant height, spike number, grain yield, and aerial N accumulation under different N supply levels. In addition, overexpressing <i>Ta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>2.1-3A</i> in Arabidopsis elevated auxin accumulation in the primary root tip, LR tip, LR primordia, and cotyledon and hypocotyl and increased primary root length, visible LR number, and shoot fresh weight under high- and low-N conditions.

Insights into the Evolution of Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoproteins from 1000 Plant Transcriptomes
<p>The carbohydrate-rich cell walls of land plants and algae have been the focus of much interest given the value of cell wall-based products to our current and future economies. Hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), a major group of wall glycoproteins, play important roles in plant growth and development, yet little is known about how they have evolved in parallel with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>e components of walls. We investigate the origins and evolution of the HRGP superfamily, which is commonly divided into three major multigene families: the arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), extensins (EXTs), and proline-rich proteins. Using motif and amino acid bias, a newly developed bioinformatics pipeline, we identified HRGPs in sequences from the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (<ext-link>www.onekp.com</ext-link>). Our analyses provide new insights into the evolution of HRGPs across major evolutionary milestones, including the transition to land and the early radiation of angiosperms. Significantly, data mining reveals the origin of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored AGPs in green algae and a 3- to 4-fold increase in GPI-AGPs in liverworts and mosses. The first detection of cross-linking (CL)-EXTs is observed in bryophytes, which suggests that CL-EXTs arose though the juxtaposition of preexisting SP<sub>n</sub> EXT glycomotifs with refined Y-based motifs. We also detected the loss of CL-EXT in a few lineages, including the grass family (Poaceae), that have a cell wall composition distinct from other monocots and eudicots. A key challenge in HRGP research is tracking individual HRGPs throughout evolution. Using the 1000 Plants output, we were able to find putative orthologs of Arabidopsis pollen-specific GPI-AGPs in basal eudicots.</p>

Cellulose-Derived Oligomers Act as Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns and Trigger Defense-Like Responses
<p>The plant cell wall, often the site of initial encounters between plants and their microbial pathogens, is composed of a complex mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>es as well as proteins. The concept of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) was proposed to describe plant elicitors like oligogalacturonides (OGs), which can be derived by the breakdown of the pectin homogalacturon by pectinases. OGs act via many of the same signaling steps as pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to elicit defenses and provide protection against pathogens. Given both the complexity of the plant cell wall and the fact that many pathogens secrete a wide range of cell wall-degrading enzymes, we reasoned that the breakdown products of other cell wall polymers may be similarly biologically active as elicitors and may help to reinforce the perception of danger by plant cells. Our results indicate that oligomers derived from cellulose are perceived as signal molecules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), triggering a signaling cascade that shares some similarities to responses to well-known elicitors such as chitooligomers and OGs. However, in contrast to other known PAMPs/DAMPs, cellobiose stimulates neither detectable reactive oxygen species production nor callose deposition. Confirming our idea that both PAMPs and DAMPs are likely to cooccur at infection sites, cotreatments of cellobiose with flg22 or chitooligomers led to synergistic increases in gene expression. Thus, the perception of cellulose-derived oligomers may participate in cell wall integrity surveillance and represents an additional layer of signaling following plant cell wall breakdown during cell wall remodeling or pathogen attack.</p>

KNS4/UPEX1: A Type II Arabinogalactan <i>β</i>-(1,3)-Galactosyltransferase Required for Pollen Exine Development
<p>Pollen exine is essential for protection from the environment of the male gametes of seed-producing plants, but its assembly and composition remain poorly understood. We previously characterized Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) mutants with abnormal pollen exine structure and morphology that we named <i>kaonashi</i> (<i>kns</i>). Here we describe the identification of the causal gene of <i>kns4</i> that was found to be a member of the CAZy glycosyltransferase 31 gene family, identical to <i>UNEVEN PATTERN OF EXINE1</i>, and the biochemical characterization of the encoded protein. The characteristic exine phenotype in the <i>kns4</i> mutant is related to an abnormality of the primexine matrix laid on the surface of developing microspores. Using light microscopy with a combination of type II arabinogalactan (AG) antibodies and staining with the arabinogalactan-protein (AGP)-specific β-Glc Yariv reagent, we show that the levels of AGPs in the <i>kns4</i> microspore primexine are considerably diminished, and their location differs from that of wild type, as does the distribution of pectin labeling. Furthermore, <i>kns4</i> mutants exhibit reduced fertility as indicated by shorter fruit lengths and lower seed set compared to the wild type, confirming that KNS4 is critical for pollen viability and development. KNS4 was heterologously expressed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, and was shown to possess β-(1,3)-galactosyltransferase activity responsible for the synthesis of AG glycans that are present on both AGPs and/or the pectic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>e rhamnogalacturonan I. These data demonstrate that defects in AGP/pectic glycans, caused by disruption of <i>KNS4</i> function, impact pollen development and viability in Arabidopsis.</p>

DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) Regulates Cell Walls in the Leaf Epidermis
<p>The plant epidermis is crucial to survival, regulating interactions with the environment and controlling plant growth. The phytocalpain DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (DEK1) is a master regulator of epidermal differentiation and maintenance, acting upstream of epidermis-specific transcription factors, and is required for correct cell adhesion. It is currently unclear how changes in DEK1 lead to cellular defects in the epidermis and the pathways through which DEK1 acts. We have combined growth kinematic studies, cell wall analysis, and transcriptional analysis of genes downstream of DEK1 to determine the cause of phenotypic changes observed in DEK1-modulated lines of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We reveal a novel role for DEK1 in the regulation of leaf epidermal cell wall structure. Lines with altered DEK1 activity have epidermis-specific changes in the thickness and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>e composition of cell walls that likely underlie the loss of adhesion between epidermal cells in plants with reduced levels of DEK1 and changes in leaf shape and size in plants constitutively overexpressing the active CALPAIN domain of DEK1. Calpain-overexpressing plants also have increased levels of cellulose and pectins in epidermal cell walls, and this is correlated with the expression of several cell wall-related genes, linking transcriptional regulation downstream of DEK1 with cellular effects. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the role of the epidermal cell walls in growth regulation and establish a new role for DEK1 in pathways regulating epidermal cell wall deposition and remodeling.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 extracted from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of grasses, but its specific binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>get is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 binding to sequentially extracted maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily binds glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>e in grass CWs. This binding is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 binding, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By mixing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were observed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially binds GAX. In contrast, no PRE was observed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the rigid fraction of GAX became more rigid upon EXPB1 binding while the dynamic fraction became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens grass CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which binds cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>get in grass CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand binding for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in metabolism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>get metabolome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 metabolites showed dynamic changes in metabolites related to amino acid biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary metabolism, which could facilitate the production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polysaccharid</span></strong>es and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these metabolic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary metabolism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s metabolic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.</p>

The olfactory neuron AWC promotes avoidance of normally palatable food following chronic dietary restriction
<p>Changes in metabolic state alter foraging behavior and food preference in animals. Here, I show that normally attractive food becomes repulsive to <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> if animals are chronically undernourished as a result of alimen<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tar</span></strong>y tract defects. This behavioral plasticity is achieved in two ways: increased food leaving and induction of aversive behavior towards food. A particularly strong food avoider is defective in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chitin</span></strong> synthase that makes the pharyngeal lining. Food avoidance induced by underfeeding is mediated by cGMP signaling in the olfactory neurons AWC and AWB, and the gustatory neurons ASJ and ASK. Food avoidance is enhanced by increased population density and is reduced if the animals are unable to correctly interpret their nutritional state as a result of defects in the AMP kinase or TOR/S6kinase pathways. The TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway suppresses food avoidance and the cellular basis for this is distinct from its role in aversive olfactory learning of harmful food. This study suggests that nutritional state feedback via nutrient sensors, population size and olfactory neurons guides food preference in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

SULTR3s Function in Chloroplast Sulfate Uptake and Affect ABA Biosynthesis and the Stress Response
<p>Plants are major sulfur reducers in the global sulfur cycle. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e, the major natural sulfur source in soil, is absorbed by plant roots and transported into plastids, where it is reduced and assimilated into Cys for further metabolic processes. Despite its importance, how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e is transported into plastids is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated using single Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genetic mutants that each member of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e transporter (SULTR) subfamily 3 was able to transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e across the chloroplast envelope membrane. To resolve the function of SULTR3s, we constructed a <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant completely knocking out all five members of the subfamily. Here we report that all members of the <i>SULTR3</i> subfamily show chloroplast membrane localization. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e uptake by chloroplasts of the quintuple mutant is reduced by more than 50% compared with the wild type. Consequently, Cys and abscisic acid (ABA) content are reduced to ∼67 and ∼20% of the wild-type level, respectively, and strong positive correlations are found among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e, Cys, and ABA content. The <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant shows obvious growth retardation with smaller rosettes and shorter roots. Seed germination of the <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and salt stress, but is rescued by sulfide supplementation. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e-induced stomatal closure is abolished in the quintuple mutant, strongly suggesting that chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e is required for stomatal closure. Our genetic analyses unequivocally demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e transporter subfamily 3 is responsible for more than half of the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e uptake and influences downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e assimilation and ABA biosynthesis.</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al types found in leaves: amorphous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> carbonate cystoliths, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als and the control that the leaf exerts over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al distribution that is preserved in different environments. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

Drought-Enhanced Xylem Sap Sulfate Closes Stomata by Affecting ALMT12 and Guard Cell ABA Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Water limitation of plants causes stomatal closure to prevent water loss by transpiration. For this purpose, progressing soil water deficit is communicated from roots to shoots. Abscisic acid (ABA) is the key signal in stress-induced stomatal closure, but ABA as an early xylem-delivered signal is still a matter of debate. In this study, poplar plants (<i>Populus × canescens</i>) were exposed to water stress to investigate xylem sap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e and ABA, stomatal conductance, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e transporter (<i>SULTR</i>) expression. In addition, stomatal behavior and expression of ABA receptors, drought-responsive genes, transcription factors, and <i>NCED3</i> were studied after feeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e and ABA to detached poplar leaves and epidermal peels of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The results show that increased xylem sap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e is achieved upon drought by reduced xylem unloading by PtaSULTR3;3a and PtaSULTR1;1, and by enhanced loading from parenchyma cells into the xylem via PtaALMT3b. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e application caused stomatal closure in excised leaves and peeled epidermis. In the loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e-channel function mutant, At<i>almt12</i>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e-triggered stomatal closure was impaired. The QUAC1/ALMT12 anion channel heterologous expressed in oocytes was gated open by extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e up-regulated the expression of <i>NCED3</i>, a key step of ABA synthesis, in guard cells. In conclusion, xylem-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e seems to be a chemical signal of drought that induces stomatal closure via QUAC1/ALMT12 and/or guard cell ABA synthesis.</p>

CaMKII protein abundance was increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (<i>P</i><0.001). The CaMKII target pT17-phospholamban was 5.5-fold increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (<i>P</i>=0.01), as was autophosphorylated CaMKII (<i>P</i><0.01), suggestive of constitutive activation. Calcineurin (<i>PPP3CB</i>) mRNA was not increased, nor was <i>RCAN1</i> mRNA level, indicating a lack of calcineurin activation. Furthermore, myocyte enhancer factor 2 and nuclear factor of activated T cell transcription factor activity was not increased in HCM, suggesting that calcineurin pathway activation is not an upstream cause of increased CAMKII protein abundance or activation. <i>SERCA2A</i> mRNA transcript levels were reduced in HCM regardless of genotype, as was sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> ATPase 2/phospholamban protein ratio (45% reduced; <i>P</i>=0.03). <sup>45</sup>Ca sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> ATPaseuptake assay showed reduced uptake velocity in HCM regardless of genotype (<i>P</i>=0.01).

Calcium Pumps and Interacting BON1 Protein Modulate Calcium Signature, Stomatal Closure, and Plant Immunity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> signaling is essential for environmental responses including immune responses. Here, we provide evidence that the evolutionarily conserved protein BONZAI1 (BON1) functions together with autoinhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> ATPase10 (ACA10) and ACA8 to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> signals in Arabidopsis. BON1 is a plasma membrane localized protein that negatively regulates the expression of immune receptor genes and positively regulates stomatal closure. We found that BON1 interacts with the autoinhibitory domains of ACA10 and ACA8, and the <i>aca10</i> loss-of-function (LOF) mutants have an autoimmune phenotype similar to that of the <i>bon1</i> LOF mutants. Genetic evidences indicate that BON1 positively regulates the activities of ACA10 and ACA8. Consistent with this idea, the steady level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> concentration is increased in both <i>aca10</i> and <i>bon1</i> mutants. Most strikingly, cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> oscillation imposed by external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> treatment was altered in <i>aca10</i>, <i>aca8</i>, and <i>bon1</i> mutants in guard cells. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>- and pathogen-induced stomatal closure was compromised in the <i>aca10</i> and <i>bon1</i> mutants. Taken together, this study indicates that ACA10/8 and BON1 physically interact on plasma membrane and function in the generation of cytosol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> signatures that are critical for stomatal movement and impact plant immunity.</p>

Global rates of marine sulfate reduction and implications for sub–sea-floor metabolic activities
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e reduction is a globally important redox process in marine sediments, yet global rates are poorly quantified. We developed an artificial neural network trained with 199 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e profiles, constrained with geomorphological and geochemical maps to estimate global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e-reduction rate distributions. Globally, 11.3 teramoles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e are reduced yearly (~15% of previous estimates), accounting for the oxidation of 12 to 29% of the organic carbon flux to the sea floor. Combined with global cell distributions in marine sediments, these results indicate a strong contrast in sub–sea-floor prokaryote habitats: In continental margins, global cell numbers in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e-depleted sediment exceed those in the overlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e-bearing sediment by one order of magnitude, whereas in the abyss, most life occurs in oxic and/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e-reducing sediments.</p>

Higher Novel L-Cys Degradation Activity Results in Lower Organic-S and Biomass in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than the Related Saltwort, <i>Salicornia</i>
<p><i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i> are almost identical halophytes whose edible succulent shoots hold promise for commercial production in saline water. Enhanced sulfur nutrition may be beneficial to crops naturally grown on high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e. However, little is known about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e nutrition in halophytes. Here we show that <i>Salicornia europaea</i> (ecotype RN) exhibits a significant increase in biomass and organic-S accumulation in response to supplemental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e, whereas <i>Sarcocornia fruticosa</i> (ecotype VM) does not, instead exhibiting increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e accumulation. We investigated the role of two pathways on organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcoconia</i>: the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e reductive pathway that generates Cys and <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase that degrades Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, and pyruvate. The major function of <i>O</i>-acetyl-Ser-(thiol) lyase (OAS-TL; EC 2.5.1.47) is the formation of <sc>l</sc>-Cys, but our study shows that the OAS-TL A and OAS-TL B of both halophytes are enzymes that also degrade <sc>l</sc>-Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S. This activity was significantly higher in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than in <i>Salicornia</i>, especially upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e supplementation. The activity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e reductive pathway key enzyme, adenosine 5′-phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e reductase (APR, EC 1.8.99.2), was significantly higher in <i>Salicornia</i> than in <i>Sarcocornia</i>. These results suggest that the low organic-S level in <i>Sarcocornia</i> is the result of high <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate by OAS-TLs, whereas the greater organic-S and biomass accumulation in <i>Salicornia</i> is the result of higher APR activity and low <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate, resulting in higher net Cys biosynthesis. These results present an initial road map for halophyte growers to attain better growth rates and nutritional value of <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i>.</p>

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart pumps blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This pumping function is achieved through synchronous contraction of billions of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly couple external electrical impulses to the triggering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> ion release from intracellular stores and subsequent activation of force-producing proteins, a process termed excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> channel with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold protein called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> release during E-C coupling. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C coupling, reduced pumping capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and function as a transcription factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addition to its “day job” as a structural protein, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

Our structure reveals a tetrameric architecture, with the soluble and transmembrane domains adopting different symmetric arrangements within the channel. The conserved W-D-Φ-Φ-E-P-V-T-Y sequence motif of MCU pore forms a selectivity filter comprising two acidic rings separated by one helical turn along the central axis of the channel pore.

Fractal-like hierarchical organization of bone begins at the nanoscale

However, the organization and relationship between bone’s principal components—<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al and collagen—has not been clearly elucidated. Using three-dimensional electron tomography imaging and high-resolution two-dimensional electron microscopy, we demonstrate that bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al is hierarchically assembled beginning at the nanoscale: Needle-shaped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al units merge laterally to form platelets, and these are further organized into stacks of roughly parallel platelets.

On the basis of these observations, we present a structural model of hierarchy and continuity for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al phase, which contributes to the structural integrity of bone.</p>

Mitochondrial redox signaling enables repair of injured skeletal muscle cells
<p>Strain and physical trauma to mechanically active cells, such as skeletal muscle myofibers, injures their plasma membranes, and mitochondrial function is required for their repair. We found that mitochondrial function was also needed for plasma membrane repair in myoblasts as well as nonmuscle cells, which depended on mitochondrial uptake of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> through the mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> uniporter (MCU). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> uptake transiently increased the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which locally activated the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) RhoA, triggering F-actin accumulation at the site of injury and facilitating membrane repair. Blocking mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> uptake or ROS production prevented injury-triggered RhoA activation, actin polymerization, and plasma membrane repair. This repair mechanism was shared between myoblasts, nonmuscle cells, and mature skeletal myofibers. Quenching mitochondrial ROS in myofibers during eccentric exercise ex vivo caused increased damage to myofibers, resulting in a greater loss of muscle force. These results suggest a physiological role for mitochondria in plasma membrane repair in injured cells, a role that highlights a beneficial effect of ROS.</p>

The formation of peak rings in large impact craters
<p>Large impacts provide a mechanism for resurfacing planets through mixing near-surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s with deeper material. Central peaks are formed from the dynamic uplift of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s during crater formation. As crater size increases, central peaks transition to peak rings. Without samples, debate surrounds the mechanics of peak-ring formation and their depth of origin. Chicxulub is the only known impact structure on Earth with an unequivocal peak ring, but it is buried and only accessible through drilling. Expedition 364 sampled the Chicxulub peak ring, which we found was formed from uplifted, fractured, shocked, felsic basement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s. The peak-ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s are cross-cut by dikes and shear zones and have an unusually low density and seismic velocity. Large impacts therefore generate vertical fluxes and increase porosity in planetary crust.</p>

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have a far worse prognosis than those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). In the intact heart, SSc-PAH exhibits depressed rest and reserve right ventricular (RV) contractility compared with IPAH.

Isolated myocyte passive length-tension and developed tension-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> relationships were determined and correlated with in vivo RV function and reserve. RV septal fibrosis was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocyte passive stiffness from length-tension relations was similarly increased in IPAH and SSc-PAH compared with control, although SSc-PAH biopsies had more interstitial fibrosis. More striking disparities were found between active force-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> relations. Compared with controls, maximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>-activated force (F<sub>max</sub>) was 28% higher in IPAH but 37% lower in SSc-PAH. F<sub>max</sub> in SSc-d was intermediate between control and SSc-PAH. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> concentration required for half-maximal force (EC<sub>50</sub>) was similar between control, IPAH, and SSc-d but lower in SSc-PAH.

Cholesterol sulfate is a DOCK2 inhibitor that mediates tissue-specific immune evasion in the eye
<p>Although immune responses are essential to protect the body from infection, they can also harm tissues. Certain tissues and organs, including the eye, constitute specialized microenvironments that locally inhibit immune reactivity. Dedicator of cytokinesis protein 2 (DOCK2) is a Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that is predominantly found in hematopoietic cells. DOCK2 plays a key role in immune surveillance because it is essential for the activation and migration of leukocytes. <i>DOCK2</i> mutations cause severe immunodeficiency in humans. We found that DOCK2-mediated Rac activation and leukocyte migration were effectively inhibited by cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>e (CS), but not by cholesterol or other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>ed steroids. CS bound to the catalytic domain of DOCK2 and suppressed its GEF activity. Mass spectrometric quantification revealed that CS was most abundantly produced in the Harderian gland, which provides the lipids that form the oily layer of the tear film. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>ion of cholesterol is mediated by the sulfotransferases SULT2B1b and, to a lesser extent, SULT2B1a, which are produced from the same gene through alternative splicing. By genetically inactivating <i>Sult2b1</i>, we showed that the lack of CS in mice augmented ultraviolet- and antigen-induced ocular surface inflammation, which was suppressed by administration of eye drops containing CS. Thus, CS is a naturally occurring DOCK2 inhibitor and contributes to the generation of the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the eye.</p>

A calcium-sensing receptor mutation causing hypocalcemia disrupts a transmembrane salt bridge to activate β-arrestin–biased signaling
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals through G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> to stimulate cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> (Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub>) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling to control extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> homeostasis. Studies of loss- and gain-of-function <i>CASR</i> mutations, which cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 (FHH1) and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 (ADH1), respectively, have revealed that the CaSR signals in a biased manner. Thus, some mutations associated with FHH1 lead to signaling predominantly through the MAPK pathway, whereas mutations associated with ADH1 preferentially enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> responses. We report a previously unidentified ADH1-associated R680G CaSR mutation, which led to the identification of a CaSR structural motif that mediates biased signaling. Expressing CaSR<sup>R680G</sup> in HEK 293 cells showed that this mutation increased MAPK signaling without altering Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> responses. Moreover, this gain of function in MAPK activity occurred independently of G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i/o</sub> and was mediated instead by a noncanonical pathway involving β-arrestin proteins. Homology modeling and mutagenesis studies showed that the R680G CaSR mutation selectively enhanced β-arrestin signaling by disrupting a salt bridge formed between Arg<sup>680</sup> and Glu<sup>767</sup>, which are located in CaSR transmembrane domain 3 and extracellular loop 2, respectively. Thus, our results demonstrate CaSR signaling through β-arrestin and the importance of the Arg<sup>680</sup>-Glu<sup>767</sup> salt bridge in mediating signaling bias.</p>

Membrane depolarization activates BK channels through ROCK-mediated β1 subunit surface trafficking to limit vasoconstriction
<p>Membrane depolarization of smooth muscle cells (myocytes) in the small arteries that regulate regional organ blood flow leads to vasoconstriction. Membrane depolarization also activates large-conductance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)–activated potassium (BK) channels, which limits Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity that promotes vasoconstriction, thus leading to vasodilation. We showed that in human and rat arterial myocytes, membrane depolarization rapidly increased the cell surface abundance of auxiliary BK β1 subunits but not that of the pore-forming BKα channels. Membrane depolarization stimulated voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the activation of Rho kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2. ROCK1/2-mediated activation of Rab11A promoted the delivery of β1 subunits to the plasma membrane by Rab11A-positive recycling endosomes. These additional β1 subunits associated with BKα channels already at the plasma membrane, leading to an increase in apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and activation of the channels in pressurized arterial myocytes and vasodilation. Thus, membrane depolarization activates BK channels through stimulation of ROCK- and Rab11A-dependent trafficking of β1 subunits to the surface of arterial myocytes.</p>

Glutamate signaling at cytoneme synapses
<p>We investigated the roles of components of neuronal synapses for development of the <i>Drosophila</i> air sac primordium (ASP). The ASP, an epithelial tube, extends specialized signaling filopodia called cytonemes that take up signals such as Dpp (Decapentaplegic, a homolog of the vertebrate bone morphogenetic protein) from the wing imaginal disc. Dpp signaling in the ASP was compromised if disc cells lacked Synaptobrevin and Synaptotagmin-1 (which function in vesicle transport at neuronal synapses), the glutamate transporter, and a voltage-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> channel, or if ASP cells lacked Synaptotagmin-4 or the glutamate receptor GluRII. Transient elevations of intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> in ASP cytonemes correlate with signaling activity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> transients in ASP cells depend on GluRII, are activated by <sc>l</sc>-glutamate and by stimulation of an optogenetic ion channel expressed in the wing disc, and are inhibited by EGTA and by the GluR inhibitor NASPM (1-naphthylacetyl spermine trihydrochloride). Activation of GluRII is essential but not sufficient for signaling. Cytoneme-mediated signaling is glutamatergic.</p>

A surface gravity traverse on Mars indicates low bedrock density at Gale crater

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes

The plume contains chemical signatures of water-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong> interaction between the ocean and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>y core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong> containing reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als and organic materials. The relatively high hydrogen abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of methane from CO<sub>2</sub> in Enceladus’ ocean.</p>

Lipid transport by TMEM24 at ER–plasma membrane contacts regulates pulsatile insulin secretion
<p>Insulin is released by β cells in pulses regulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> and phosphoinositide signaling. Here, we describe how transmembrane protein 24 (TMEM24) helps coordinate these signaling events. We showed that TMEM24 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–anchored membrane protein whose reversible localization to ER-plasma membrane (PM) contacts is governed by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to oscillations in cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>. A lipid-binding module in TMEM24 transports the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] precursor phosphatidylinositol between bilayers, allowing replenishment of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolyzed during signaling. In the absence of TMEM24, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> oscillations are abolished, leading to a defect in triggered insulin release. Our findings implicate direct lipid transport between the ER and the PM in the control of insulin secretion, a process impaired in patients with type II diabetes.</p>

A Poly(A) Ribonuclease Controls the Cellotriose-Based Interaction between <i>Piriformospora indica</i> and Its Host Arabidopsis
<p><i>Piriformospora indica</i>, an endophytic root-colonizing fungus, efficiently promotes plant growth and induces resistance to abiotic stress and biotic diseases. <i>P. indica</i> fungal cell wall extract induces cytoplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> elevation in host plant roots. Here, we show that cellotriose (CT) is an elicitor-active cell wall moiety released by <i>P. indica</i> into the medium. CT induces a mild defense-like response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, changes in membrane potential, and the expression of genes involved in growth regulation and root development. CT-based cytoplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> elevation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots does not require the BAK1 coreceptor or the putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels TPC1, GLR3.3, GLR2.4, and GLR2.5 and operates synergistically with the elicitor chitin. We identified an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant (<i>cytoplasmic</i> <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> elevation mutant</i>) impaired in the response to CT and various other cellooligomers (<i>n</i> = 2–7), but not to chitooligomers (<i>n</i> = 4–8), in roots. The mutant contains a single nucleotide exchange in the gene encoding a poly(A) ribonuclease (AtPARN; At1g55870) that degrades the poly(A) tails of specific mRNAs. The wild-type <i>PARN</i> cDNA, expressed under the control of a 35S promoter, complements the mutant phenotype. Our identification of cellotriose as a novel chemical mediator casts light on the complex <i>P. indica</i>-plant mutualistic relationship.</p>

Runx1 Deficiency Protects Against Adverse Cardiac Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of heart failure and death worldwide. Preservation of contractile function and protection against adverse changes in ventricular architecture (cardiac remodeling) are key factors to limiting progression of this condition to heart failure. Consequently, new therapeutic targets are urgently required to achieve this aim. Expression of the Runx1 transcription factor is increased in adult cardiomyocytes after MI; however, the functional role of Runx1 in the heart is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To address this question, we have generated a novel tamoxifen-inducible cardiomyocyte-specific <i>Runx1</i>-deficient mouse. Mice were subjected to MI by means of coronary artery ligation. Cardiac remodeling and contractile function were assessed extensively at the whole-heart, cardiomyocyte, and molecular levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><i>Runx1</i>-deficient mice were protected against adverse cardiac remodeling after MI, maintaining ventricular wall thickness and contractile function. Furthermore, these mice lacked eccentric hypertrophy, and their cardiomyocytes exhibited markedly improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> handling. At the mechanistic level, these effects were achieved through increased phosphorylation of phospholamban by protein kinase A and relief of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase inhibition.

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular system (t-system) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-system in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-system structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-system. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-system remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-system components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-system density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-system density. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-system density versus cells with high t-system density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-system in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-system impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-system at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after mechanical unloading.</p></sec>

Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent demethylation of phosphatase PP2Ac promotes glucose deprivation–induced cell death independently of inhibiting glycolysis
<p>Cancer cells increase glucose metabolism to support aerobic glycolysis. However, only some cancer cells are acutely sensitive to glucose withdrawal, and the underlying mechanism of this selective sensitivity is unclear. We showed that glucose deprivation initiates a cell death pathway in cancer cells that is dependent on the kinase RIPK1. Glucose withdrawal triggered rapid plasma membrane depolarization and an influx of extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> into the cell through the L-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> channel Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 (CACNA1D), followed by activation of the kinase CAMK1. CAMK1 and the demethylase PPME1 were required for the subsequent demethylation and inactivation of the catalytic subunit of the phosphatase PP2A (PP2Ac) and the phosphorylation of RIPK1. Plasma membrane depolarization, PP2Ac demethylation, and cell death were prevented by glucose and, unexpectedly, by its nonmetabolizable analog 2-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-glucose (2-DG), a glycolytic inhibitor. These findings reveal a previously unknown function of glucose as a signaling molecule that protects cells from death induced by plasma membrane depolarization, independently of its role in glycolysis. Components of this cancer cell death pathway represent potential therapeutic targets against cancer.</p>

A cryo-EM–based model of phosphorylation- and FKBP12.6-mediated allosterism of the cardiac ryanodine receptor
<p>Type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> channels that play a vital role in triggering cardiac muscle contraction by releasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. Several cardiomyopathies are associated with the abnormal functioning of RyR2. We determined the three-dimensional structure of rabbit RyR2 in complex with the regulatory protein FKBP12.6 in the closed state at 11.8 óÅÅ resolution using cryo-electron microscopy and built an atomic model of RyR2. The heterogeneity in the data set revealed two RyR2 conformations that we proposed to be related to the extent of phosphorylation of the P2 domain. Because the more flexible conformation may correspond to RyR2 with a phosphorylated P2 domain, we suggest that phosphorylation may set RyR2 in a conformation that needs less energy to transition to the open state. Comparison of RyR2 from cardiac muscle and RyR1 from skeletal muscle showed substantial structural differences between the two, especially in the helical domain 2 (HD2) structure forming the Clamp domain, which participates in quaternary interactions with the dihydropyridine receptor and neighboring RyRs in RyR1 but not in RyR2. Rigidity of the HD2 domain of RyR2 was enhanced by binding of FKBP12.6, a ligand that stabilizes RyR2 in the closed state. These results help to decipher the molecular basis of the different mechanisms of activation and oligomerization of the RyR isoforms and could be extended to RyR complexes in other tissues.</p>

Two Patched molecules engage distinct sites on Hedgehog yielding a signaling-competent complex
<p>Aberrant Hedgehog (HH) signaling leads to various types of cancer and birth defects. N-terminally palmitoylated HH initiates signaling by binding its receptor Patched-1 (PTCH1).

Biological control of aragonite formation in stony corals
<p>Little is known about how stony corals build their calcareous skeletons.

Randomly arranged, amorphous nanoparticles are initially deposited in microenvironments enriched in organic material; they then aggregate and form ordered aragonitic structures through crystal growth by particle attachment. Our NMR results are consistent with heterogeneous nucleation of the solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al phase driven by coral acid-rich proteins. Such a mechanism suggests that stony corals may be able to sustain calcification even under lower pH conditions that do not favor the inorganic precipitation of aragonite.</p>

Building Archean cratons from Hadean mafic crust

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al ion homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffusion of ions between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sulfat</span></strong>ed peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in ion homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulation is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil conditions.</p>

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth’s deep mantle
<p>The redox state of Earth’s convecting mantle, masked by the lithospheric plates and basaltic magmatism of plate tectonics, is a key unknown in the evolutionary history of our planet. Here we report that large, exceptional gem diamonds like the Cullinan, Constellation, and Koh-i-Noor carry direct evidence of crystallization from a redox-sensitive metallic liquid phase in the deep mantle. These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-carbon-sulfur melt, accompanied by a thin fluid layer of methane ± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> silicate perovskite. The metal-dominated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under metal-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a metallic iron phase that contains dissolved carbon and hydrogen.</p>

Synthetic nacre by predesigned matrix-directed mineralization
<p>Although biomimetic designs are expected to play a key role in exploring future structural materials, facile fabrication of bulk biomimetic materials under ambient conditions remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a mesoscale “assembly-and-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>alization” approach inspired by the natural process in mollusks to fabricate bulk synthetic nacre that highly resembles both the chemical composition and the hierarchical structure of natural nacre. The millimeter-thick synthetic nacre consists of alternating organic layers and aragonite platelet layers (91 weight percent) and exhibits good ultimate strength and fracture toughness. This predesigned matrix-directed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>alization method represents a rational strategy for the preparation of robust composite materials with hierarchically ordered structures, where various constituents are adaptable, including brittle and heat-labile materials.</p>

Surface uplift and time-dependent seismic hazard due to fluid injection in eastern Texas
<p>Observations that unequivocally link seismicity and wastewater injection are scarce. Here we show that wastewater injection in eastern Texas causes uplift, detectable in radar interferometric data up to >8 kilometers from the wells. Using measurements of uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore pressure. We infer that an increase of >1 megapascal in pore pressure in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8–moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined, owing to diffusion of pore pressure from earlier periods with higher injection rates. Induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining formations prevent pore pressure from propagating into crystalline basement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s.</p>

Linking Duplication of a Calcium Sensor to Salt Tolerance in <i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>
<p>The SALT-OVERLY-SENSITIVE (SOS) pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) functions to prevent the toxic accumulation of sodium in the cytosol when plants are grown in salt-affected soils. In this pathway, the CALCINEURIN B-LIKE10 (AtCBL10) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> sensor interacts with the AtSOS2 kinase to activate the AtSOS1 plasma membrane sodium/proton exchanger. <i>CBL10</i> has been duplicated in Eutrema (<i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>), a salt-tolerant relative of Arabidopsis. Because Eutrema maintains growth in salt-affected soils that kill most crop plants, the duplication of <i>CBL10</i> provides a unique opportunity to functionally test the outcome of gene duplication and its link to plant salt tolerance. In Eutrema, individual down-regulation of the duplicated <i>CBL10</i> genes (<i>EsCBL10a</i> and <i>EsCBL10b</i>) decreased growth in the presence of salt and, in combination, led to an even greater decrease, suggesting that both genes function in response to salt and have distinct functions. Cross-species complementation assays demonstrated that <i>EsCBL10b</i> has an enhanced ability to activate the SOS pathway while <i>EsCBL10a</i> has a function not performed by <i>AtCBL10</i> or <i>EsCBL10b</i>. Chimeric EsCBL10a/EsCBL10b proteins revealed that the specific functions of the EsCBL10 proteins resulted from changes in the amino terminus. The duplication of <i>CBL10</i> increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>-mediated signaling capacity in Eutrema and conferred increased salt tolerance to salt-sensitive Arabidopsis.</p>

Altered Expression of a Malate-Permeable Anion Channel, OsALMT4, Disrupts Mineral Nutrition
<p>Aluminum-activated malate transporters (ALMTs) form a family of anion channels in plants, but little is known about most of its members. This study examined the function of <i>OsALMT4</i> from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We show that <i>OsALMT4</i> is expressed in roots and shoots and that the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing (OX) <i>OsALMT4</i> released malate from the roots constitutively and had 2-fold higher malate concentrations in the xylem sap than nulls, indicating greater concentrations of malate in the apoplast. OX lines developed brown necrotic spots on the leaves that did not appear on nulls. These symptoms were not associated with altered concentrations of any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al element in the leaves, although the OX lines had higher concentrations of Mn and B in their grain compared with nulls. While total leaf Mn concentrations were not different between the OX and null lines, Mn concentrations in the apoplast were greater in the OX plants. The OX lines also displayed increased expression of Mn transporters and were more sensitive to Mn toxicity than null plants. We showed that the growth of wild-type rice was unaffected by 100 µ<sc>m</sc> Mn in hydroponics but, when combined with 1 m<sc>m</sc> malate, this concentration inhibited growth. We conclude that increasing <i>OsALMT4</i> expression affected malate efflux and compartmentation within the tissues, which increased Mn concentrations in the apoplast of leaves and induced the toxicity symptoms. This study reveals new links between malate transport and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al nutrition.</p>

A Lectin Receptor-Like Kinase Mediates Pattern-Triggered Salicylic Acid Signaling
<p>Plant surface-localized pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) perceive conserved microbial features, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), resulting in disease resistance. PAMP perception leads to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> influx, MAPK activation, a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated by RbohD, accumulation of the defense hormone salicylic acid (SA), and callose deposition. Lectin receptor-like kinases (LecRKs) belong to a specific PRR family and are important players in plant innate immunity. Here, we report that LecRK-IX.2 is a positive regulator of PRR-triggered immunity. Pathogen infection activated the transcription of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>LecRK-IX.2</i>, and the <i>LecRK-IX.2</i> knockout lines exhibited enhanced susceptibility to virulent <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. In addition, LecRK-IX.2 is capable of inducing RbohD phosphorylation, likely by recruiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>-dependent protein kinases to trigger ROS production in Arabidopsis. Overexpression of <i>LecRK-IX.2</i> resulted in elevated ROS and SA and enhanced systemic acquired resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. Our data highlight the importance of LecRKs in plant immune signaling and SA accumulation.</p>

Physiological Characterization of a Plant Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter in Vitro and in Vivo<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Over the recent years, several proteins that make up the mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> uniporter complex (MCUC) mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup>uptake into the mitochondrial matrix have been identified in mammals, including the channel-forming protein MCU. Although six <i>MCU</i> gene homologs are conserved in the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in which mitochondria can accumulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a functional characterization of plant MCU homologs has been lacking. Using electrophysiology, we show that one isoform, AtMCU1, gives rise to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channel activity that can be observed even in the absence of accessory proteins implicated in the formation of the active mammalian channel. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence that AtMCU1 activity is sensitive to the mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> uniporter inhibitors Ruthenium Red and Gd<sup>3+</sup>, as well as to the Arabidopsis protein MICU, a regulatory MCUC component. AtMCU1 is prevalently expressed in roots, localizes to mitochondria, and its absence causes mild changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics as assessed by in vivo measurements in Arabidopsis root tips. Plants either lacking or overexpressing AtMCU1 display root mitochondria with altered ultrastructure and show shorter primary roots under restrictive growth conditions. In summary, our work adds evolutionary depth to the investigation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport, indicates that AtMCU1, together with MICU as a regulator, represents a functional configuration of the plant mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake complex with differences to the mammalian MCUC, and identifies a new player of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation network in plants.</p>

A Universal Stress Protein Involved in Oxidative Stress Is a Phosphorylation Target for Protein Kinase CIPK6
<p>Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) decode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> signals upon interaction with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong> sensors calcineurin B like proteins into phosphorylation events that result into adaptation to environmental stresses. Few phosphorylation targets of CIPKs are known and therefore the molecular mechanisms underlying their downstream output responses are not fully understood. Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) Cipk6 regulates immune and susceptible Programmed cell death in immunity transforming Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals into reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. To investigate SlCipk6-induced molecular mechanisms and identify putative substrates, a yeast two-hybrid approach was carried on and a protein was identified that contained a Universal stress protein (Usp) domain present in bacteria, protozoa and plants, which we named “SlRd2”. SlRd2 was an ATP-binding protein that formed homodimers in planta. SlCipk6 and SlRd2 interacted using coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves and the complex localized in the cytosol. SlCipk6 phosphorylated SlRd2 in vitro, thus defining, to our knowledge, a novel target for CIPKs. Heterologous SlRd2 overexpression in yeast conferred resistance to highly toxic LiCl, whereas SlRd2 expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> <i>UspA</i> mutant restored bacterial viability in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Finally, transient expression of SlCipk6 in transgenic <i>N</i>. <i>benthamiana</i> SlRd2 overexpressors resulted in reduced ROS accumulation as compared to wild-type plants. Taken together, our results establish that SlRd2, a tomato UspA, is, to our knowledge, a novel interactor and phosphorylation target of a member of the CIPK family, SlCipk6, and functionally regulates SlCipk6-mediated ROS generation.</p>

Mouse models of telomere dysfunction phenocopy skeletal changes found in human age-related osteoporosis
<p>A major medical challenge in the elderly is osteoporosis and the high risk of fracture. Telomere dysfunction is a cause of cellular senescence and telomere shortening, which occurs with age in cells from most human tissues, including bone. Telomere defects contribute to the pathogenesis of two progeroid disorders characterized by premature osteoporosis, Werner syndrome and dyskeratosis congenital. It is hypothesized that telomere shortening contributes to bone aging. We evaluated the skeletal phenotypes of mice with disrupted telomere maintenance mechanisms as models for human bone aging, including mutants in Werner helicase (<i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i>), telomerase (<i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i>) and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> double mutants. Compared with young wild-type (WT) mice, micro-computerized tomography analysis revealed that young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have decreased trabecular bone volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, as well as increased trabecular spacing. In cortical bone, young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have increased cortical thinning, and increased porosity relative to age-matched WT mice. These trabecular and cortical changes were accelerated with age in <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice compared with older WT mice. Histological quantification of osteoblasts in aged mice showed a similar number of osteoblasts in all genotypes; however, significant decreases in osteoid, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>alization surface, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al apposition rate and bone formation rate in older <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> bone suggest that osteoblast dysfunction is a prominent feature of precocious aging in these mice. Except in the <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i> single mutant, osteoclast number did not increase in any genotype. Significant alterations in mechanical parameters (structure model index, degree of anistrophy and moment of inertia) of the <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> femurs compared with WT mice were also observed. Young <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice had a statistically significant increase in bone-marrow fat content compared with young WT mice, which remained elevated in aged double mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants recapitulate the human bone aging phenotype and are useful models for studying age-related osteoporosis.</p>

Large Cardiac Muscle Patches Engineered From Human Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiac Cells Improve Recovery From Myocardial Infarction in Swine
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Here, we generated human cardiac muscle patches (hCMPs) of clinically relevant dimensions (4 cm × 2 cm × 1.25 mm) by suspending cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells that had been differentiated from human induced-pluripotent stem cells in a fibrin scaffold and then culturing the construct on a dynamic (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>ing) platform.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro assessments of hCMPs suggest maturation in response to dynamic culture stimulation. In vivo assessments were conducted in a porcine model of myocardial infarction (MI). Animal groups included: MI hearts treated with 2 hCMPs (MI+hCMP, n=13), MI hearts treated with 2 cell-free open fibrin patches (n=14), or MI hearts with neither experimental patch (n=15); a fourth group of animals underwent sham surgery (Sham, n=8). Cardiac function and infarct size were evaluated by MRI, arrhythmia incidence by implanted loop recorders, and the engraftment rate by calculation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of expression of the human Y chromosome. Additional studies examined the myocardial protein expression profile changes and potential mechanisms of action that related to exosomes from the cell patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The hCMPs began to beat synchronously within 1 day of fabrication, and after 7 days of dynamic culture stimulation, in vitro assessments indicated the mechanisms related to the improvements in electronic mechanical coupling, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">calcium</span></strong>-handling, and force generation, suggesting a maturation process during the dynamic culture. The engraftment rate was 10.9±1.8% at 4 weeks after the transplantation. The hCMP transplantation was associated with significant improvements in left ventricular function, infarct size, myocardial wall stress, myocardial hypertrophy, and reduced apoptosis in the periscar boarder zone myocardium. hCMP transplantation also reversed some MI-associated changes in sarcomeric regulatory protein phosphorylation. The exosomes released from the hCMP appeared to have cytoprotective properties that improved cardiomyocyte survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have fabricated a clinically relevant size of hCMP with trilineage cardiac cells derived from human induced-pluripotent stem cells. The hCMP matures in vitro during 7 days of dynamic culture. Transplantation of this type of hCMP results in significantly reduced infarct size and improvements in cardiac function that are associated with reduction in left ventricular wall stress. The hCMP treatment is not associated with significant changes in arrhythmogenicity.</p></sec>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> environments. We analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> allocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency, and carbon assimilat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency in both high and deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> allocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> and carbon partit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ing processes is critical for high oilseed product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Convergent evidence for widespread rock nitrogen sources in Earth’s surface environment
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> availability is a pivotal control on terrestrial carbon sequestrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and global climate change. Historical and contemporary views assume that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> enters Earth’s land-surface ecosystems from the atmosphere. Here we demonstrate that bedrock is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> source that rivals atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> inputs across major sectors of the global terrestrial environment. Evidence drawn from the planet’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> balance, geochemical proxies, and our spatial weathering model reveal that ~19 to 31 teragrams of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> are mobilized from near-surface rocks annually. About 11 to 18 teragrams of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> are chemically weathered in situ, thereby increasing the unmanaged (preindustrial) terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> balance from 8 to 26%. These findings provide a global perspective to reconcile Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> budget, with implicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s for nutrient-driven controls over the terrestrial carbon sink.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>).   Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA.

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolyte with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper–lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF<sub>3</sub>) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and defluorinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in a fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature.

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair. The dynamic, reversible format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multinuclear sites from mobilized single atoms represents a distinct phenomenon that falls outside the convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al boundaries of a heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst.</p>

Soft X-Ray Imaging of Cellular Carbon and Nitrogen Distributions in Heterocystous Cyanobacteria
<p>Soft x-ray microscopy (SXM) is a minimally invasive technique for single-cell high-resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> imaging as well as the visualizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of intracellular distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of light elements such as carbon, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>, and oxygen. We used SXM to observe photosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the filamentous cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp.

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium. Under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-limiting condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, a fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the vegetative cells in each filament terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ality of the filament, as an associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> based on the growth of the filament under diazotrophic condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. The predicted growth rate under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-replete and -deplete condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, as well as the effect of external carbon and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites. Several combinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of exchange metabolites resulted in predicted growth rates that are higher than growth rates achieved by only considering exchange of metabolites previously suggested in the literature. The curated model of the metabolic network of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 enhances our ability to understand the metabolic organizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multicellular cyanobacteria and provides a platform for further study and engineering of their metabolism.</p>

Architecture of the complete oxygen-sensing FixL-FixJ two-component signal transduction system
<p>The symbiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-fixing bacterium <i>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</i> is critical to the agro-industrial product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of soybean because it enables the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of high yields of soybeans with little use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>ous fertilizers. The FixL and FixJ two-component system (TCS) of this bacterium ensures that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is only stimulated under condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of low oxygen. When it is not bound to oxygen, the histidine kinase FixL undergoes autophosphorylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and transfers phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the response regulator FixJ, which, in turn, stimulates the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of genes required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We purified full-length <i>B. japonicum</i> FixL and FixJ proteins and defined their structures individually and in complex using small-angle x-ray scattering, crystallographic, and in silico modeling techniques. Comparison of active and inactive forms of FixL suggests that intramolecular signal transduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is driven by local changes in the sensor domain and in the coiled-coil reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> connecting the sensor and histidine kinase domains.

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other monatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for proton channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in plant development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone signaling in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing plants, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> coupled with quantitative polymerase chain react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-silenced plants. Moreover, exogenous applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of BR enhanced chlorophyll content and autophagosome format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and decreased the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of ubiquitinated proteins under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> starvat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Leaf chlorosis and chlorophyll degradat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> starvat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy photosynthesis in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy photosynthesis. The relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) access<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s showing large variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in leaf Chl. These relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale photosynthesis to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy photosynthesis through Chl reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. These simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s demonstrate that canopy photosynthesis should not increase with Chl reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>. However, similar rates of canopy photosynthesis can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> resulting from decreased Chl. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally, analysis of these simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s indicate that the inability of Chl reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to increase photosynthesis arises primarily from the connect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> and the light absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> profile. These simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the “saved” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

Dynamics of Ethylene Production in Response to Compatible Nod Factor
<p>Establishment of symbiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in legumes is regulated by the plant hormone ethylene, but it has remained unclear whether and how its biosynthesis is regulated by the symbiotic pathway. We established a sensitive ethylene detect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> system for <i>Lotus japonicus</i> and found that ethylene product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> increased as early as 6 hours after inoculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with <i>Mesorhizobium loti</i>. This ethylene response was dependent on Nod factor product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by compatible rhizobia. Analyses of nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> mutants showed that percept<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Nod factor was required for ethylene emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, while downstream transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factors including CYCLOPS, NIN, and ERN1 were not required for this response. Activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> signaling pathway in spontaneously nodulating mutants was also sufficient to elevate ethylene product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Ethylene signaling is controlled by EIN2, which is duplicated in <i>L. japonicus</i>. We obtained a <i>L. japonicus Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant that exhibits complete ethylene insensitivity and confirms that these two genes act redundantly in ethylene signaling. Consistent with this redundancy, both <i>LjEin2a</i> and <i>LjEin2b</i> are required for negative regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutants are hypernodulating and hyperinfected. We also identified an unexpected role for ethylene in the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, with the <i>Ljein2a Ljein2b</i> double mutant showing severely reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. These results demonstrate that ethylene product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is an early and sustained nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> response that acts at multiple stages to regulate infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, nodule organogenesis, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>L. japonicus</i>.</p>

Predicting Dynamic Metabolic Demands in the Photosynthetic Eukaryote <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>
<p>Phototrophic organisms exhibit a highly dynamic proteome, adapting their biomass composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in response to diurnal light/dark cycles and nutrient availability. Here, we used experimentally determined biomass composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s over the course of growth to determine and constrain the biomass objective funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (BOF) in a genome-scale metabolic model of <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> UTEX 395 over time. Changes in the BOF, which encompasses all metabolites necessary to produce biomass, influence the state of the metabolic network thus directly affecting predict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s using dynamic BOFs predicted distinct proteome demands during heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth. Model-driven analysis of extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and predicted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> uptake rates revealed an intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> pool, which contains 38% of the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> provided in the medium for photoautotrophic and 13% for heterotrophic growth. Agreement between flux and gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> trends was determined by statistical comparison. Accordance between predicted flux trends and gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> trends was found for 65% of multisubunit enzymes and 75% of allosteric react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. React<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with the highest agreement between simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and experimental data were associated with energy metabolism, terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, predicted flux distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s at each time point were compared with gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> data to gain new insights into intracellular compartmentalizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, specifically for transporters. A total of 103 genes related to internal transport react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were identified and added to the updated model of <i>C. vulgaris</i>, <i>i</i>CZ946, thus increasing our knowledgebase by 10% for this model green alga.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma

Phylogenomics reveals multiple losses of nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis

Factoring stream turbulence into global assessments of nitrogen pollution
<p>The discharge of excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> to streams and rivers poses an existential threat to both humans and ecosystems.

Reanalysis of these data reveals that stream turbulence (in particular, turbulent mass transfer across the concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> boundary layer) imposes a previously unrecognized upper limit on the rate at which nitrate is removed from streams. The upper limit closely approximates measured nitrate removal rates in streams with low concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of this pollutant, a discovery that should inform stream restorat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> designs and efforts to assess the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> pollut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> on receiving water quality and the global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> cycle.</p>

Toward an optically controlled brain

Metabolic recycling of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase supports breast cancer biomass
<p>Ammonia is a ubiquitous by-product of cellular metabolism; however, the biological consequences of ammonia product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are not fully understood, especially in cancer. We found that ammonia is not merely a toxic waste product but is recycled into central amino acid metabolism to maximize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> utilizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. In our experiments, human breast cancer cells primarily assimilated ammonia through reductive aminat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH); secondary react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s enabled other amino acids, such as proline and aspartate, to directly acquire this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>. Metabolic recycling of ammonia accelerated proliferat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of breast cancer. In mice, ammonia accumulated in the tumor microenvironment and was used directly to generate amino acids through GDH activity. These data show that ammonia is not only a secreted waste product but also a fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> source that can support tumor biomass.</p>

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits

We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the same diameter.

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive.

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of carbohydrate oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, CO<sub>2</sub> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> chlorosis and resuscitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nitrate to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the oxidative pentose phosphate cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose phosphate pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s required to reconstitute a vegetative cell.

<i>Medicago</i> Plants Control Nodulation by Regulating Proteolysis of the Receptor-Like Kinase DMI2
<p>Plants use receptor-like kinases to monitor environmental changes and transduce signals into plant cells. The <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (hereafter <i>M</i>. <i>truncatula</i>) DOES NOT MAKE INFECT<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>S2 (DMI2) protein funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s as a coreceptor of rhizobial signals to initiate nodule development and rhizobial infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-fixing symbiosis, but the mechanisms regulating DMI2 protein level and folding are still unknown. Here, we report that DMI2 protein abundance changes during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-fixing symbiosis. DMI2 accumulates in the nodules and is induced by rhizobia treatment through a posttranscript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al process. However, DMI2 induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is independent of the percept<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Nod factor, a group of lipochitooligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia. The stability of the DMI2 protein is controlled by the proteasome pathway: in rhizobia-free environments, DMI2 is degraded by the proteasome, but during rhizobial infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, DMI2 is protected from the proteasome, resulting in protein accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor-promoted accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of DMI2 protein in <i>Medicago</i> roots induces the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of two early nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> marker genes, supporting the hypothesis that DMI2 accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> activates downstream symbiosis signaling. The extracellular reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of DMI2 contains two malectin-like domains (MLDs) and a leucine-rich repeat. When conserved amino acids in the MLDs are mutated, DMI2 fails to restore nodule development in <i>dmi2</i> mutants, and point-mutated MLD proteins are degraded constitutively, suggesting that the MLD may be vital for the accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of DMI2. Our findings suggest that legumes control nodule development through modulating the protein level of DMI2, revealing a layer of regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between plants and rhizobia in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-fixing symbiosis.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> current induced by muscarinic stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and distinct current–voltage relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with K<sup>+</sup>-free solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Three-dimensional holey-graphene/niobia composite architectures for ultrahigh-rate energy storage
<p>Nanostructured materials have shown extraordinary promise for electrochemical energy storage but are usually limited to electrodes with rather low mass loading (~1 milligram per square centimeter) because of the increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in thicker electrodes. We report the design of a three-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al (3D) holey-graphene/niobia (Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) composite for ultrahigh-rate energy storage at practical levels of mass loading (>10 milligrams per square centimeter). The highly interconnected graphene network in the 3D architecture provides excellent electron transport properties, and its hierarchical porous structure facilitates rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport. By systematically tailoring the porosity in the holey graphene backbone, charge transport in the composite architecture is optimized to deliver high areal capacity and high-rate capability at high mass loading, which represents a critical step forward toward practical applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Cryo-EM structures of the triheteromeric NMDA receptor and its allosteric modulation
<p><i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are heterotetrameric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels assembled as diheteromeric or triheteromeric complexes. Here, we report structures of the triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B receptor in the absence or presence of the GluN2B-specific allosteric modulator Ro 25-6981 (Ro), determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In the absence of Ro, the GluN2A and GluN2B amino-terminal domains (ATDs) adopt “closed” and “open” clefts, respectively. Upon binding Ro, the GluN2B ATD clamshell transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s from an open to a closed conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Consistent with a predominance of the GluN2A subunit in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel gating, the GluN2A subunit interacts more extensively with GluN1 subunits throughout the receptor, in comparison with the GluN2B subunit. Differences in the conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the pseudo-2-fold–related GluN1 subunits further reflect receptor asymmetry. The triheteromeric NMDAR structures provide the first view of the most common NMDA receptor assembly and show how incorporat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of two different GluN2 subunits modifies receptor symmetry and subunit interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, allowing each subunit to uniquely influence receptor structure and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, thus increasing receptor complexity.</p>

Coordination-induced weakening of ammonia, water, and hydrazine X–H bonds in a molybdenum complex

Here we report the synthesis of a molybdenum ammonia complex supported by terpyridine and phosphine ligands that lowers the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-hydrogen bond dissociat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> free energy from 99.5 (gas phase) to an experimentally measured value of 45.8 kilocalories per mole (agreeing closely with a value of 45.1 kilocalories per mole calculated by density funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al theory). This bond weakening enables spontaneous dihydrogen evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> upon gentle heating, as well as the hydrogenat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of styrene. Analogous molybdenum complexes promote dihydrogen evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from coordinated water and hydrazine.

Dissolved organic sulfur in the ocean: Biogeochemistry of a petagram inventory

We present a basin-scale distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of solid-phase extractable DOS in the East Atlantic Ocean and the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Although molar DOS versus dissolved organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> (DON) ratios of 0.11 ± 0.024 in Atlantic surface water resembled phytoplankton stoichiometry (sulfur/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> ~ 0.08), increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) versus DOS ratios and decreasing meth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ine-S yield demonstrated selective DOS removal and active involvement in marine biogeochemical cycles.

Identification of LRRC8 Heteromers as an Essential Component of the Volume-Regulated Anion Channel VRAC
<sec><title>One Swell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Channel</title><p>When mammalian cells are faced with osmotic challenges, they need to swell or shrink.

CYP79D73 Participates in Biosynthesis of Floral Scent Compound 2-Phenylethanol in <i>Plumeria rubra</i>
<p>Plumeria (<i>Plumeria rubra</i>), well known for its brightly colored and fragrant flowers, emits a number of floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Plumeria flowers emit a total of 43 VOCs including nine phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, such as 2-phenylethanol (2PE), benzaldehyde, 2-phenylacetaldehyde (PAld), (<i>E/Z</i>)<i>-</i>phenylacetaldoxime (PAOx), benzyl nitrile (BN), and 2-phenylnitroethane (PN). To identify genes and pathways involved in the product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the major compound 2PE, we analyzed the plumeria floral transcriptome and found a highly expressed, flower-specific gene encoding a cytochrome P450 family 79D protein (PrCYP79D73), which catalyzed the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx. Feeding experiments with deuterated phenylalanine or deuterated (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx showed that (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of 2PE, as are two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-containing volatiles, BN and PN, in plumeria flowers. Crude enzyme extracts from plumeria flowers converted <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx, PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN. The biosynthesis of these compounds increased with addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of PrCYP79D73-enriched microsomes but was blocked by pretreatment with 4-phenylimidazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Moreover, overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>PrCYP79D73</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> resulted in the emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of (<i>E/Z</i>)-PAOx as well as PAld, 2PE, BN, and PN, all of which were also found among plumeria floral VOCs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PrCYP79D73 is a crucial player in the biosynthesis of the major floral VOC 2PE and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-containing volatiles. These volatiles may be required for plant defense as well as to attract pollinators for the successful reproduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of plumeria.</p>

The Chromatin Factor HNI9 and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 Maintain ROS Homeostasis under High Nitrogen Provision
<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can accumulate in cells at excessive levels, leading to unbalanced redox states and to potential oxidative stress, which can have damaging effects on the molecular components of plant cells. Several environmental condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s have been described as causing an elevat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of ROS product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in plants. Consequently, activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of detoxificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> responses is necessary to maintain ROS homeostasis at physiological levels. Misregulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of detoxificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> systems during oxidative stress can ultimately cause growth retardat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and developmental defects. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants grown in a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> (N) environment express a set of genes involved in detoxificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of ROS that maintain ROS at physiological levels. We show that the chromatin factor HIGH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> INSENSITIVE9 (HNI9) is an important mediator of this response and is required for the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of detoxificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> genes. Mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in HNI9 leads to elevated ROS levels and ROS-dependent phenotypic defects under high but not low N provis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, we identify ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 as a major transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor required for activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the detoxificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> program under high N.

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters

In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and pH homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth phenotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar pH and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles. These results highlight the importance of NHX-type cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the maintenance of cellular cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and in growth and development.</p>

NRT1.1-Related NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Toxicity Is Associated with a Disturbed Balance between NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Uptake and Assimilation
<p>A high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) as the sole source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> in the growth medium often is toxic to plants. The nitrate transporter NRT1.1 is involved in mediating the effects of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity; however, the mechanism remains undefined. In this study, wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Columbia-0 [Col-0]) and <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants (<i>chl1-1</i> and <i>chl1-5</i>) were grown hydroponically in NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> media to assess the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of NRT1.1 in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress responses. All the plants grew normally in medium containing mixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> sources, but Col-0 displayed more chlorosis and lower biomass and photosynthesis than the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants in (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium. Grafting experiments between Col-0 and <i>chl1-5</i> further confirmed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity is influenced by NRT1.1. In (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium, NRT1.1 induced the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> transporters, increasing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally, the activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthetase in roots of Col-0 plants decreased and soluble sugar accumulated significantly, whereas pyruvate kinase-mediated glycolysis was not affected, all of which contributed to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. By contrast, the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants showed reduced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> through glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthetase, and glutamate dehydrogenase. Moreover, the up-regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of genes involved in ethylene synthesis and senescence in Col-0 plants treated with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> suggests that ethylene is involved in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity responses.

<i>INCREASING NODULE SIZE1</i> Expression Is Required for Normal Rhizobial Symbiosis and Nodule Development
<p>Nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is crucial for biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (BNF) in legumes, but the molecular mechanisms underlying BNF have remained elusive. Here, we cloned a candidate gene underlying a major nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> quantitative trait locus in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>), <i>INCREASING NODULE SIZE1</i> (<i>GmINS1</i>). <i>GmINS1</i> encodes a cell wall β-expansin and is expressed primarily in vascular bundles, along with cortical and parenchyma cells of nodules. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms distinguishing the two parents were found in the <i>GmINS1</i> promoter reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Among them, single-nucleotide polymorphism A/C has a significant effect on <i>GmINS1</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the parental genotype P2, based on β-glucuronidase activity and promoter delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> analysis. The express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>GmINS1</i> and the P2 genotype promoter was strongly associated with nodule development, not only in the parents but also in 40 progeny lines and 40 genotypes selected from a soybean core collect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>GmINS1</i> resulted in increases in the number, biomass, infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> cell abundance, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>ase activity of large nodules and subsequently changed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> content and biomass of soybean plants. <i>GmINS1</i> suppress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> via RNA interference had the opposite effect. Double suppress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>GmEXPB2</i> and <i>GmINS1</i> dramatically inhibited soybean nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Our results reveal that <i>GmINS1</i> is a critical gene in nodule development and that <i>GmEXPB2</i> and <i>GmINS1</i> synergistically control nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in soybean. Our findings shed light on the genetic basis of soybean nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and provide a candidate gene for optimizing BNF capacity through molecular breeding in soybean.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>ase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al modificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of nodule proteins: carbonylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, which occurs by direct oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of certain amino acids or by interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid peroxides; and glycat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, which results from the react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. Lipid peroxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> products induced most carbonylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> sites. This study also revealed that carbonylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> has major effects on two key nodule proteins. Metal-catalyzed oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> caused the inactivat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of leghemoglobin. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key nodule proteins: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> or glycat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of crucial proteins involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> metabolism, transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

Darkened Leaves Use Different Metabolic Strategies for Senescence and Survival
<p>In plants, an individually darkened leaf initiates senescence much more rapidly than a leaf from a whole darkened plant. Combining transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we present an overview of the metabolic strategies that are employed in response to different darkening treatments. Under darkened plant condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, the percept<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of carbon starvat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> drove a profound metabolic readjustment in which branched-chain amino acids and potentially monosaccharides released from cell wall loosening became important substrates for maintaining minimal ATP product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Concomitantly, the increased accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of amino acids with a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-carbon ratio may provide a safety mechanism for the storage of metabolically derived cytotoxic ammonium and a pool of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> for use upon returning to typical growth condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Conversely, in individually darkened leaf, the metabolic profiling that followed our <sup>13</sup>C-enrichment assays revealed a temporal and differential exchange of metabolites, including sugars and amino acids, between the darkened leaf and the rest of the plant. This active transport could be the basis for a progressive metabolic shift in the substrates fueling mitochondrial activities, which are central to the catabolic react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s facilitating the retrieval of nutrients from the senescing leaf. We propose a model illustrating the specific metabolic strategies employed by leaves in response to these two darkening treatments, which support either rapid senescence or a strong capacity for survival.</p>

An Iron-Activated Citrate Transporter, MtMATE67, Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for symbiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in legume nodules, where it is required for the activity of bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>ase, plant leghemoglobin, respiratory oxidases, and other Fe proteins in both organisms. Fe solubility and transport within and between plant tissues is facilitated by organic chelators, such as nicotianamine and citrate. We have characterized a nodule-specific citrate transporter of the multidrug and toxic compound extrus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> family, MtMATE67 of <i>Medicago truncatula</i>. The MtMATE67 gene was induced early during nodule development and expressed primarily in the invas<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> zone of mature nodules. The MtMATE67 protein was localized to the plasma membrane of nodule cells and also the symbiosome membrane surrounding bacteroids in infected cells. In oocytes, MtMATE67 transported citrate out of cells in an Fe-activated manner. Loss of <i>MtMATE67</i> gene funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> resulted in accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Fe in the apoplasm of nodule cells and a substantial decrease in symbiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and plant growth. Taken together, the results point to a primary role of MtMATE67 in citrate efflux from nodule cells in response to an Fe signal. This efflux is necessary to ensure Fe(III) solubility and mobility in the apoplasm and uptake into nodule cells. Likewise, MtMATE67-mediated citrate transport into the symbiosome space would increase the solubility and availability of Fe(III) for rhizobial bacteroids.</p>

Suboptimal Acclimation of Photosynthesis to Light in Wheat Canopies<sup>[CC-BY]</sup>
<p>Photosynthetic acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (photoacclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>) is the process whereby leaves alter their morphology and/or biochemistry to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and productivity according to long-term changes in the light environment. The three-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al architecture of plant canopies imposes complex light dynamics, but the drivers for photoacclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in such fluctuating environments are poorly understood. A technique for high-resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> three-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al reconstruct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was combined with ray tracing to simulate a daily time course of radiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> profiles for architecturally contrasting field-grown wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) canopies. An empirical model of photoacclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was adapted to predict the optimal distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of photosynthesis according to the fluctuating light patterns throughout the canopies. While the photoacclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model output showed good correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with field-measured gas-exchange data at the top of the canopy, it predicted a lower optimal light-saturated rate of photosynthesis at the base. Leaf Rubisco and protein contents were consistent with the measured optimal light-saturated rate of photosynthesis. We conclude that, although the photosynthetic capacity of leaves is high enough to exploit brief periods of high light within the canopy (particularly toward the base), the frequency and durat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of such sunflecks are too small to make acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> a viable strategy in terms of carbon gain. This suboptimal acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> renders a large port<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of residual photosynthetic capacity unused and reduces photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> use efficiency at the canopy level, with further implicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s for photosynthetic productivity. It is argued that (1) this represents an untapped source of photosynthetic potential and (2) canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> could be lowered with no detriment to carbon gain or grain protein content.</p>

DELLA1-Mediated Gibberellin Signaling Regulates Cytokinin-Dependent Symbiotic Nodulation
<p>In legume plants, low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> soils promote symbiotic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with rhizobial bacteria, leading to the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-fixing root nodules. Among critical signals regulating this developmental process are bacterial Nod Factors (NFs) and several plant hormones, including cytokinins (CKs) and gibberellins (GAs). Here, we show in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> that GA signaling mediated by DELLA1 decreases the amount of bioactive CKs in roots and negatively impacts the Cytokinin Response1 (CRE1)-dependent NF activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a subset of CK-signaling genes as well as of the CK-regulated <i>Nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Signaling Pathway2</i> and <i>Ethylene Response Factor Required for Nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>1</i> early nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> genes. Consistently, a dominant-active DELLA1 protein can partially rescue the reduced nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <i>cre1</i> mutant and triggers the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nodule-like structures when expressed in the root cortex or in the root epidermis. This suggests a model where the DELLA1-mediated GA signaling interplays with the CRE1-dependent CK pathway to regulate early nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in response to both NF and CK signals critical for this symbiotic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Determining the Site of Action of Strigolactones during Nodulation
<p>Strigolactones (SLs) influence the ability of legumes to associate with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong>-fixing bacteria. In this study, we determine the precise stage at which SLs influence nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We show that SLs promote infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> thread format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, as a null SL-deficient pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) mutant forms significantly fewer infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> threads than wild-type plants, and this reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can be overcome by the applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the synthetic SL GR24. We found no evidence that SLs influence physical events in the plant before or after infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> thread format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, since SL-deficient plants displayed a similar ability to induce root hair curling in response to rhizobia or Nod lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) and SL-deficient nodules appear to fix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> at a similar rate to those of wild-type plants. In contrast, an SL receptor mutant displayed no decrease in infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> thread format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> or nodule number, suggesting that SL deficiency may influence the bacterial partner. We found that this influence of SL deficiency was not due to altered flavonoid exudat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> or the ability of root exudates to stimulate bacterial growth. The influence of SL deficiency on infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> thread format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was accompanied by reduced express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of some early nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> genes. Importantly, SL synthesis is down-regulated by mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in genes of the Nod LCO signaling pathway, and this requires the downstream transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor <i>NSP2</i> but not <i>NIN</i>. This, together with the fact that the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of certain SL biosynthesis genes can be elevated in response to rhizobia/Nod LCOs, suggests that Nod LCOs may induce SL biosynthesis. SLs appear to influence nodulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> independently of ethylene act<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, as SL-deficient and ethylene-insensitive double mutant plants display essentially additive phenotypes, and we found no evidence that SLs influence ethylene synthesis or vice versa.</p>

Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can theoretically be fueled by and dependent upon an array of central metabolism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> found in respiratory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale screens revealed 2-fold variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in nighttime leaf respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural access<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> collect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> grown under common favorable condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. R<sub>N</sub> variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental differences within the sampling regime. To pursue metabolic explanat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s for leaf R<sub>N</sub> variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, parallel metabolite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an access<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, R<sub>N</sub> correlated strongly with stored carbon substrates, including starch and dicarboxylic acids, as well as sucrose, major amino acids, shikimate, and salicylic acid. Among different access<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, metabolite-R<sub>N</sub> correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino acids but not stored carbon substrates. A complementary screen of the effect of exogenous metabolites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of substrates, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and substrate supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> did not stimulate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited nighttime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nitrogen</span></strong> assimilat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely uncorrelated in mature leaves. These results indicate that differences in preceding daytime metabolic activities are the major source of variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

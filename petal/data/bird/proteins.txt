Thrombospondin-1 promotes matrix homeostasis by interacting with collagen and lysyl oxidase precursors and collagen cross-linking sites
<p>Fibrillar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong>s of the extracellular matrix are critical for tissue structure and physiology; however, excessive or abnormal deposition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong>s is a defining feature of fibrosis. Regulatory mechanisms that act on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> fibril assembly potentially offer new targets for antifibrotic treatments. Tissue weakening, altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> fibril morphologies, or both, are shared phenotypes of mice lacking matricellular thrombospondins. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) plays an indirect role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> homeostasis through interactions with matrix metalloproteinases and transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1). We found that TSP1 also affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> fibril formation directly. Compared to skin from wild-type mice, skin from <i>Thbs1</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice had reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> cross-linking and reduced prolysyl oxidase (proLOX) abundance with increased conversion to catalytically active LOX. In vitro, TSP1 bound to both the C-pro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e domain of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> I and the highly conserved KGHR sequences of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> triple-helical domain that participate in cross-linking. TSP1 also bound to proLOX and inhibited proLOX processing by bone morphogenetic protein-1. In human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), TSP1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> I colocalized in intracellular vesicles and on extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> fibrils, whereas TSP1 and proLOX colocalized only in intracellular vesicles. Inhibition of LOX-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> cross-linking did not prevent the extracellular association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> and TSP1; however, treatment of HDFs with KGHR-containing, TSP1-binding, triple-helical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es disrupted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong>-TSP1 association, perturbed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> extracellular matrix, and increased myofibroblastic differentiation in a manner that depended on TGF-β receptor 1. Thus, the extracellular KGHR-dependent interaction of TSP1 with fibrillar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong>s contributes to fibroblast homeostasis.</p>

Unusual Diversity of Myoglobin Genes in the Lungfish
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> is a respiratory protein that serves as a model system in a variety of biological fields. Its main function is to deliver and store O<sub>2</sub> in the heart and skeletal muscles, but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> is also instrumental in homeostasis of nitric oxide (NO) and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Almost every vertebrate harbors a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> gene; only some cyprinid fishes have two recently duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> genes. Here we show that the West African lungfish <i>Protopterus annectens</i> has at least seven distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> genes (<i>PanMb1–7</i>), which diverged early in the evolution of lungfish and showed an enhanced evolutionary rate. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>s are lungfish specific, and no other globin gene was found amplified. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>s are differentially expressed in various lungfish tissues, and the brain is the main site of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> expression. The typical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>-containing tissues, the skeletal muscle and the heart, have much lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> mRNA levels. Muscle and heart express distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>s (<i>PanMb1</i> and <i>PanMb3</i>, respectively). In cell culture, lungfish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>s improved cellular survival under hypoxia albeit with different efficiencies and reduced the production of reactive oxygen species. Only <i>Mb2</i> and <i>Mb6</i> enhanced the energy status of the cells. The unexpected diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> hints to a functional diversification of this gene: some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>s may have adapted to the O<sub>2</sub> requirements of the specific tissue and help the lungfish to survive hypoxic periods; other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong>s may have taken over the roles of neuroglobin and cytoglobin, which appear to be missing in the West African lungfish.</p>

Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p>Cell motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and cancer cell invasion. It is generally thought that migrating cells grab and exert traction force onto the extracellular matrix in order to pull the cell body forward. While previous studies have shown that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> II deficient cells migrate efficiently, whether these cells exert traction forces during cell migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a force sensor and shRNA specific to each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA and IIB individually regulate cell migration and traction force generation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction force was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA deficient cells lost actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIB deficient cells maintained similar actin organization and focal adhesions as wild-type cells. Interestingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA deficient cells migrated faster than wild-type or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIB deficient cells on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA deficient cells exerted significantly less traction force at the leading edge than wild-type or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIB deficient cells. These results suggest that, in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA mediated force-generating machinery, cells move with minimal traction forces at the cell periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of cells to adapt and migrate.</p>

The pseudokinase domains of guanylyl cyclase–A and –B allosterically increase the affinity of their catalytic domains for substrate
<p>Natriuretic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es regulate multiple physiologic systems by activating transmembrane receptors containing intracellular guanylyl cyclase domains, such as GC-A and GC-B, also known as Npr1 and Npr2, respectively. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es contain an intracellular, phosphorylated pseudokinase domain (PKD) critical for activation of the C-terminal cGMP-synthesizing guanylyl cyclase domain. Because ATP allosterically activates GC-A and GC-B, we investigated how ATP binding to the PKD influenced guanylyl cyclase activity. Molecular modeling indicated that all the residues of the ATP-binding site of the prototypical kinase PKA, except the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ate, are conserved in the PKDs of GC-A and GC-B. Kinase-inactivating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alanin</span></strong>e substitutions for the invariant lysine in subdomain II or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-B failed to decrease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e phosphate content, consistent with the PKDs lacking kinase activity. In contrast, both mutations reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e activation by blocking the ability of ATP to decrease the Michaelis constant without affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e-dependent activation. The analogous lysine-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alanin</span></strong>e substitution in a glutamate-substituted phosphomimetic mutant form of GC-B also reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e activity, consistent with ATP stimulating guanylyl cyclase activity through an allosteric, phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Mutations designed to rigidify the conserved regulatory or catalytic spines within the PKDs increased guanylyl cyclase activity, increased sensitivity to natriuretic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e, or reduced the Michaelis constant in the absence of ATP, consistent with ATP binding stabilizing the PKD in a conformation analogous to that of catalytically active kinases. We conclude that allosteric mechanisms evolutionarily conserved in the PKDs promote the catalytic activation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases.</p>

The olfactory neuron AWC promotes avoidance of normally palatable food following chronic dietary restriction
<p>Changes in metabolic state alter foraging behavior and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference in animals. Here, I show that normally attractive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> becomes repulsive to <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> if animals are chronically undernourished as a result of alimentary tract defects. This behavioral plasticity is achieved in two ways: increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> leaving and induction of aversive behavior towards <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>. A particularly strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoider is defective in the chitin synthase that makes the pharyngeal lining. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance induced by underfeeding is mediated by cGMP signaling in the olfactory neurons AWC and AWB, and the gustatory neurons ASJ and ASK. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance is enhanced by increased population density and is reduced if the animals are unable to correctly interpret their nutritional state as a result of defects in the AMP kinase or TOR/S6kinase pathways. The TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway suppresses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance and the cellular basis for this is distinct from its role in aversive olfactory learning of harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>. This study suggests that nutritional state feedback via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> sensors, population size and olfactory neurons guides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> uptake, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> uptake. Under low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> availability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> acquisition by reallocating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

Crystal structure of a TAPBPR–MHC I complex reveals the mechanism of peptide editing in antigen presentation
<p>Central to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–mediated immunity is the recognition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e–major histocompatibility complex class I (p–MHC I) proteins displayed by antigen-presenting cells. Chaperone-mediated loading of high-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es onto MHC I is a key step in the MHC I antigen presentation pathway. However, the structure of MHC I with a chaperone that facilitates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e loading has not been determined. We report the crystal structure of MHC I in complex with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e editor TAPBPR (TAP-binding protein–related), a tapasin homolog. TAPBPR remodels the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e-binding groove of MHC I, resulting in the release of low-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e. Changes include groove relaxation, modifications of key binding pockets, and domain adjustments. This structure captures a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e-receptive state of MHC I and provides insights into the mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e editing by TAPBPR and, by analogy, tapasin.</p>

Cold acclimation alters the connective tissue content of the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) heart
<p>Thermal acclimation can alter cardiac function and morphology in a number of fish species, but little is known about the regulation of these changes. The purpose of the present study was to determine how cold acclimation affects zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) cardiac morphology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> composition and connective tissue regulation. Heart volume, the thickness of the compact myocardium, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> content and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> fiber composition were compared between control (27°C) and cold-acclimated (20°C) zebrafish using serially sectioned hearts stained with Picrosirius Red. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> content and fiber composition of the pericardial membrane were also examined. Cold acclimation did not affect the volume of the contracted heart; however, there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the compact myocardium. There was also a decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> content of the compact myocardium and in the amount of thick <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> fibers throughout the heart. Cold-acclimated zebrafish also increased expression of the gene transcript for matrix metalloproteinase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> Type I α1. We propose that the reduction in the thickness of the compact myocardium as well as the change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> content may help to maintain the compliance of the ventricle as temperatures decrease. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the zebrafish heart undergoes significant remodeling in response to cold acclimation.</p>

Factorial Effects of Evolocumab and Atorvastatin on Lipoprotein Metabolism

Evolocumab is under investigation for its effects on cardiovascular outcomes in statin-treated, high-risk patients. The mechanism of action of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> metabolism remains to be fully evaluated. Stable isotope tracer kinetics can effectively elucidate the mode of action of new lipid-regulating pharmacotherapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a 2-by-2 factorial trial of the effects of atorvastatin (80 mg daily) and subcutaneous evolocumab (420 mg every 2 weeks) for 8 weeks on the plasma kinetics of very-low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> (VLDL)–apo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> B-100 (apoB), intermediate-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>–apoB, and LDL-apoB in 81 healthy, normolipidemic, nonobese men. The kinetics of apoB in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>s was studied using a stable isotope infusion of D3-leucine, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and multicompartmental modeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Atorvastatin and evolocumab independently accelerated the fractional catabolism of VLDL-apoB (<i>P</i><0.001 and <i>P</i>.032, respectively), intermediate-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>–apoB (<i>P</i>=0.021 and <i>P</i>=.002, respectively), and LDL-apoB (<i>P</i><0.001, both interventions). Evolocumab but not atorvastatin decreased the production rate of intermediate-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>–apoB (<i>P</i>=0.043) and LDL-apoB (<i>P</i><0.001), which contributed to the reduction in the plasma pool sizes of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> particles. The reduction in LDL-apoB and LDL-cholesterol concentrations was significantly greater with combination versus either monotherapy (<i>P</i><0.001). Whereas evolocumab but not atorvastatin lowered the concentration of free PCSK9, atorvastatin lowered the lathosterol/campesterol ratio (a measure of cholesterol synthesis/absorption) and apoC-III concentration.

Two Membrane-Anchored Aspartic Proteases Contribute to Pollen and Ovule Development
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ic proteases are a class of proteolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es with conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ate residues, which are implicated in protein processing, maturation, and degradation. Compared with yeast and animals, plants possess a larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ic protease family. However, little is known about most of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. Here, we characterized two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ic protease genes, <i>A36</i> and <i>A39</i>, which are highly expressed in pollen and pollen tubes. <i>a36</i> and <i>a36 a39</i> mutants display significantly reduced pollen activity. Transmission electron microscopy and terminal-deoxy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotid</span></strong>yl transferase-mediated nick end labeling assays further revealed that the unviable pollen in <i>a36 a39</i> may undergo unanticipated apoptosis-like programmed cell death. The degeneration of female gametes also occurred in <i>a36 a39</i>. Aniline Blue staining, scanning electron microscopy, and semi in vitro guidance assays indicated that the micropylar guidance of pollen tubes is significantly compromised in <i>a36 a39</i>. A36 and A39 that were fused with green fluorescent protein are localized to the plasma membrane and display punctate cytosolic localization and colocalize with the GPI-anchored protein COBRA-LIKE10. Furthermore, in <i>a36 a39</i>, the abundance of highly methylesterified homogalacturonans and xyloglucans was increased significantly in the apical pollen tube wall. These results indicate that A36 and A39, two putative GPI-anchored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aspart</span></strong>ic proteases, play important roles in plant reproduction in Arabidopsis.</p>

Effects of PCSK9 Inhibition With Alirocumab on Lipoprotein Metabolism in Healthy Humans

Although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hepatic LDL receptors as the basis for LDL lowering by PCSK9 inhibitors, there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> metabolism. In particular, it is not known whether inhibition of PCSK9 has any effects on very low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> or intermediate-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> (IDL) metabolism. Inhibition of PCSK9 also results in reductions of plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong> (a) levels.

At the end of each period, fractional clearance rates (FCRs) and production rates (PRs) of apoB and apo(a) were determined. In 10 participants, postprandial triglycerides and apoB48 levels were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Alirocumab reduced ultracentrifugally isolated LDL-C by 55.1%, LDL-apoB by 56.3%, and plasma Lp(a) by 18.7%. The fall in LDL-apoB was caused by an 80.4% increase in LDL-apoB FCR and a 23.9% reduction in LDL-apoB PR. The latter was due to a 46.1% increase in IDL-apoB FCR coupled with a 27.2% decrease in conversion of IDL to LDL. The FCR of apo(a) tended to increase (24.6%) without any change in apo(a) PR. Alirocumab had no effects on FCRs or PRs of very low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>s-apoB and very low-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipoprotein</span></strong>s triglycerides or on postprandial plasma triglycerides or apoB48 concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Alirocumab decreased LDL-C and LDL-apoB by increasing IDL- and LDL-apoB FCRs and decreasing LDL-apoB PR.

The nuclear translocation of the kinases p38 and JNK promotes inflammation-induced cancer
<p>The stimulated nuclear translocation of signaling proteins, such as MAPKs, is a necessity for the initiation and regulation of their physiological functions. Previously, we determined that nuclear translocation of the MAPKs p38 and JNK involves binding to heterodimers comprising importin 3 and either importin 7 or importin 9. Here, we identified the importin-binding region in p38 and JNK and developed a myristoylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e targeting this site that we called PERY. The PERY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e specifically blocked the interaction of p38 and JNK with the importins, restricted their nuclear translocation, and inhibited phosphorylation of their nuclear (but not cytoplasmic) substrates. Through these effects, the PERY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e reduced the proliferation of several (but not all) cancer cell lines in culture and inhibited the growth of a human breast cancer xenograft in mice. In addition, the PERY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e substantially inhibited inflammation in mice, as manifested in models of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer. The PERY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e more effectively prevented colon cancer development than did a commercial p38 inhibitor. In vivo analysis further suggested that this effect was mediated by PERY <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e–induced prevention of the nuclear translocation of p38 in macrophages. Together, these results support the use of the nuclear translocation of p38 and JNK as a novel drug target to treat various cancers and inflammation-induced diseases.</p>

Processed foods and food reward

Editing peptide presentation to T cells
<p>In mammals, two types of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, MHC I and MHC II, are found on the surface of cells in association with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es. If these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es are antigenic—that is, if they induce an immune response—the resulting MHC I–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e complexes are recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which are effector immune cells, whereas MHC II-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e complexes are recognized by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which facilitate both humoral and cellular immune responses.

Potent peptidic fusion inhibitors of influenza virus
<p>Influenza therapeutics with new targets and mechanisms of action are urgently needed to combat potential pandemics, emerging viruses, and constantly mutating strains in circulation. We report here on the design and structural characterization of potent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>ic inhibitors of influenza hemagglutinin. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e design was based on complementarity-determining region loops of human broadly neutralizing antibodies against the hemagglutinin (FI6v3 and CR9114). The optimized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es exhibit nanomolar affinity and neutralization against influenza A group 1 viruses, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and avian H5N1 strains. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e inhibitors bind to the highly conserved stem epitope and block the low pH–induced conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>ic compounds and their advantageous biological properties should accelerate the development of new small molecule– and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e-based therapeutics against influenza virus.</p>

UBE2O remodels the proteome during terminal erythroid differentiation
<p>During terminal differentiation, the global protein complement is remodeled, as epitomized by erythrocytes, whose cytosol is ~98% globin. The erythroid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>e undergoes a rapid transition at the reticulocyte stage; however, the mechanisms driving programmed elimination of preexisting cytosolic proteins are unclear. We found that a mutation in the murine <i>Ube2o</i> gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e induced during erythropoiesis, results in anemia. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>ic analysis suggested that UBE2O is a broad-spectrum ubiquitinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e that remodels the erythroid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>e. In particular, ribosome elimination, a hallmark of reticulocyte differentiation, was defective in <i>Ube2o<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants. UBE2O recognized ribosomal proteins and other substrates directly, targeting them to proteasomes for degradation. Thus, in reticulocytes, the induction of ubiquitinating factors may drive the transition from a complex to a simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>e.</p>

Systems-level analysis of mechanisms regulating yeast metabolic flux
<p>Cellular metabolic fluxes are determined by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e activities and metabolite abundances. Biochemical approaches reveal the impact of specific substrates or regulators on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e kinetics but do not capture the extent to which metabolite and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e concentrations vary across physiological states and, therefore, how cellular reactions are regulated. We measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e and metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes across 25 steady-state yeast cultures. We then assessed the extent to which flux can be explained by a Michaelis-Menten relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e, substrate, product, and potential regulator concentrations. This revealed three previously unrecognized instances of cross-pathway regulation, which we biochemically verified. One of these involved inhibition of pyruvate kinase by citrate, which accumulated and thereby curtailed glycolytic outflow in nitrogen-limited yeast. Overall, substrate concentrations were the strongest driver of the net rates of cellular metabolic reactions, with metabolite concentrations collectively having more than double the physiological impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Myosins XI Are Involved in Exocytosis of Cellulose Synthase Complexes
<p>In plants, cellulose is synthesized at the cell surface by plasma membrane (PM)-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that underpin delivery of CSCs to the PM, however, are poorly understood. Cortical microtubules have been shown to interact with CESA-containing compartments and mark the site for CSC delivery, but are not required for the delivery itself. Here, we demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> XI and the actin cytoskeleton mediate CSC delivery to the PM by coordinating the exocytosis of CESA-containing compartments. Measurement of cellulose content indicated that cellulose biosynthesis was significantly reduced in a <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> xik xi1 xi2</i> triple-knockout mutant. By combining genetic and pharmacological disruption of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> activity with quantitative live-cell imaging, we observed decreased abundance of PM-localized CSCs and reduced delivery rate of CSCs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>-deficient cells. These phenotypes correlated with a significant increase in failed vesicle secretion events at the PM as well as an abnormal accumulation of CESA-containing compartments at the cell cortex. Through high-resolution spatiotemporal assays of cortical vesicle behavior, we identified defects in CSC vesicle tethering and fusion at the PM. Furthermore, disruption of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> activity reduced the delivery of several other secretory markers to the PM and reduced constitutive and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These findings reveal a previously undescribed role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> in vesicle secretion and cellulose production at the cytoskeleton-PM-cell wall nexus.</p>

Multi-Omics Driven Assembly and Annotation of the Sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) Genome
<p>Indian sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) is an important tropical evergreen tree known for its fragrant heartwood-derived essential oil and its valuable carving wood. Here, we applied an integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>ic approach to assemble and annotate the Indian sandalwood genome. Our genome sequencing resulted in the establishment of a draft map of the smallest genome for any woody tree species to date (221 Mb). The genome annotation predicted 38,119 protein-coding genes and 27.42% repetitive DNA elements. In-depth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>e analysis revealed the identities of 72,325 unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es, which confirmed 10,076 of the predicted genes. The addition of transcriptomic and proteogenomic approaches resulted in the identification of 53 novel proteins and 34 gene-correction events that were missed by genomic approaches. Proteogenomic analysis also helped in reassigning 1,348 potential noncoding RNAs as bona fide protein-coding messenger RNAs. Gene expression patterns at the RNA and protein levels indicated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e sequencing was useful in capturing proteins encoded by nuclear and organellar genomes alike. Mass spectrometry-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>ic evidence provided an unbiased approach toward the identification of proteins encoded by organellar genomes. Such proteins are often missed in transcriptome data sets due to the enrichment of only messenger RNAs that contain poly(A) tails. Overall, the use of integrated omic approaches enhanced the quality of the assembly and annotation of this nonmodel plant genome. The availability of genomic, transcriptomic, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>ic data will enhance genomics-assisted breeding, germplasm characterization, and conservation of sandalwood trees.</p>

Genome-Wide Identification of <i>Medicago</i> Peptides Involved in Macronutrient Responses and Nodulation
<p>Growing evidence indicates that small, secreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es (SSPs) play critical roles in legume growth and development, yet the annotation of SSP-coding genes is far from complete. Systematic reannotation of the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> genome identified 1,970 homologs of established SSP gene families and an additional 2,455 genes that are potentially novel SSPs, previously unreported in the literature. The expression patterns of known and putative SSP genes based on 144 RNA sequencing data sets covering various stages of macro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> deficiencies and symbiotic interactions with rhizobia and mycorrhiza were investigated. Focusing on those known or suspected to act via receptor-mediated signaling, 240 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>-responsive and 365 nodulation-responsive Signaling-SSPs were identified, greatly expanding the number of SSP gene families potentially involved in acclimation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> deficiencies and nodulation. Synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e applications were shown to alter root growth and nodulation phenotypes, revealing additional regulators of legume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> acquisition.

Two Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases from <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Have Distinct Roles in Lipid Metabolism
<p>The metabolism of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is important for environmental stress responses by eukaryotic microalgae. G3P is an essential precursor for glycerolipid synthesis and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> starvation. G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH) mediates G3P synthesis, but the roles of specific GPDH isoforms are currently poorly understood. Of the five GPDH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> were shown to be induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> starvation and/or salt stress. Heterologous expression of GPD2, a putative chloroplastic GPDH, and GPD3, a putative cytosolic GPDH, in a yeast <i>gpd1</i>Δ mutant demonstrated the functionality of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> knockdown mutants for <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> showed no difference in growth but displayed significant reduction in TAG concentration compared with the wild type in response to phosphorus or nitrogen starvation. Overexpression of <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> gave distinct phenotypes. <i>GPD2</i> overexpression lines showed only subtle metabolic phenotypes and no significant alteration in growth. In contrast, <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines displayed significantly inhibited growth and chlorophyll concentration, reduced glycerol concentration, and changes to lipid composition compared with the wild type, including increased abundance of phosphatidic acids but reduced abundance of diglycerides, triglycerides, and phosphatidylglycerol lipids. This may indicate a block in the downstream glycerolipid metabolism pathway in <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines. Thus, lipid engineering by GPDH modification may depend on the activities of other downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e steps. These results also suggest that GPD2 and GPD3 GPDH isoforms are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> starvation-induced TAG accumulation but have distinct metabolic functions.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and identified metabolic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es that could generate a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es that modify the scaffold (tailoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic gene clusters.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
In <i>Drosophila</i>, RhoGEF2 cooperates with activated Ras in tumorigenesis through a pathway involving Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II and JNK signalling
<p>The <i>Ras</i> oncogene contributes to ∼30% of human cancers, but alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis. In a <i>Drosophila</i> screen for oncogenes that cooperate with an activated allele of <i>Ras</i> (<i>Ras<sup>ACT</sup></i>) to promote tissue overgrowth and invasion, we identified the GTP exchange factor <i>RhoGEF2</i>, an activator of Rho-family signalling. Here, we show that RhoGEF2 also cooperates with an activated allele of a downstream effector of Ras, <i>Raf</i> (<i>Raf<sup>GOF</sup></i>). We dissect the downstream pathways through which RhoGEF2 cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> (and Raf<sup>GOF</sup>), and show that RhoGEF2 requires Rho1, but not Rac, for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, of the Rho1 effectors, we show that RhoGEF2 + Ras (Raf)-mediated tumorigenesis requires the Rho kinase (Rok)–Myosin-II pathway, but not Diaphanous, Lim kinase or protein kinase N. The Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II pathway leads to the activation of Jun kinase (JNK), in cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>. Moreover, we show that activation of Rok or Myosin II, using constitutively active transgenes, is sufficient for cooperative tumorigenesis with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>, and together with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> leads to strong activation of JNK. Our results show that Rok–Myosin-II activity is necessary and sufficient for Ras-mediated tumorigenesis. Our observation that activation of Myosin II, which regulates Filamentous actin (F-actin) contractility without affecting F-actin levels, cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> to promote JNK activation and tumorigenesis, suggests that increased cell contractility is a key factor in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we show that signalling via the Tumour necrosis factor (TNF; also known as Egr)-ligand–JNK pathway is most likely the predominant pathway that activates JNK upon Rok activation. Overall, our analysis highlights the need for further analysis of the Rok–Myosin-II pathway in cooperation with Ras in human cancers.</p>

The bacterial Ras/Rap1 site-specific endopeptidase RRSP cleaves Ras through an atypical mechanism to disrupt Ras-ERK signaling
<p>The Ras–extracellular signal–regulated kinase pathway is critical for controlling cell proliferation, and its aberrant activation drives the growth of various cancers. Because many pathogens produce toxins that inhibit Ras activity, efforts to develop effective Ras inhibitors to treat cancer could be informed by studies of Ras inhibition by pathogens. <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> causes fatal infections in a manner that depends on multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin, a toxin that releases bacterial effector domains into host cells. One such domain is the Ras/Rap1-specific endo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>ase (RRSP), which site-specifically cleaves the Switch I domain of the small GTPases Ras and Rap1. We solved the crystal structure of RRSP and found that its backbone shares a structural fold with the EreA/ChaN-like superfamily of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. Unlike other proteases in this family, RRSP is not a metalloprotease. Through nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotid</span></strong>e exchange assays, we determined that the processing of KRAS by RRSP did not release any fragments or cause KRAS to dissociate from its bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotid</span></strong>e but instead only locally affected its structure. However, this structural alteration of KRAS was sufficient to disable guanine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotid</span></strong>e exchange factor–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotid</span></strong>e exchange and prevent KRAS from binding to RAF. Thus, RRSP is a bacterial effector that represents a previously unrecognized class of protease that disconnects Ras from its signaling network while inducing limited structural disturbance in its target.</p>

A designed heme-[4Fe-4S] metalloenzyme catalyzes sulfite reduction like the native enzyme
<p>Multielectron redox reactions often require multicofactor metallo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es to facilitate coupled electron and proton movement, but it is challenging to design artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es to catalyze these important reactions, owing to their structural and functional complexity. We report a designed heteronuclear heme-[4Fe-4S] cofactor in cytochrome <i>c</i> peroxidase as a structural and functional model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e sulfite reductase. The initial model exhibits spectroscopic and ligand-binding properties of the native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e, and sulfite reduction activity was improved—through rational tuning of the secondary sphere interactions around the [4Fe-4S] and the substrate-binding sites—to be close to that of the native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e. By offering insight into the requirements for a demanding six-electron, seven-proton reaction that has so far eluded synthetic catalysts, this study provides strategies for designing highly functional multicofactor artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es.</p>

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the structural space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e macrocycles lack regular secondary structures and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local structures not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable structures that can be adopted by macrocyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es composed of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence design and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 designs predicted to fold into single stable structures, many times more than the number of currently available unbound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e macrocycle structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of 9 of 12 designed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic designs, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of structures possible for short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug design and library selection methods.</p>

Structure of the TAPBPR–MHC I complex defines the mechanism of peptide loading and editing
<p>Adaptive immunity is shaped by a selection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es presented on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules. The chaperones Tapasin (Tsn) and TAP-binding protein–related (TAPBPR) facilitate MHC I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e loading and high-affinity epitope selection. Despite the pivotal role of Tsn and TAPBPR in controlling the hierarchical immune response, their catalytic mechanism remains unknown. Here, we present the x-ray structure of the TAPBPR–MHC I complex, which delineates the central step of catalysis. TAPBPR functions as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e selector by remodeling the MHC I α2-1-helix region, stabilizing the empty binding groove, and inserting a loop into the groove that interferes with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e binding.

Polymeric peptide pigments with sequence-encoded properties
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melanin</span></strong>s are a family of heterogeneous polymeric pigments that provide ultraviolet (UV) light protection, structural support, coloration, and free radical scavenging. Formed by oxidative oligomerization of catecholic small molecules, the physical properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melanin</span></strong>s are influenced by covalent and noncovalent disorder. We report the use of tyrosine-containing tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es as tunable precursors for polymeric pigments. In these structures, phenols are presented in a (supra-)molecular context dictated by the positions of the amino acids in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e sequence. Oxidative polymerization can be tuned in a sequence-dependent manner, resulting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e sequence–encoded properties such as UV absorbance, morphology, coloration, and electrochemical properties over a considerable range.

Root diffusion barrier control by a vasculature-derived peptide binding to the SGN3 receptor
<p>The root endodermis forms its extracellular diffusion barrier by developing ringlike impregnations called Casparian strips. A factor responsible for their establishment is the SCHENGEN3/GASSHO1 (SGN3/GSO1) receptor-like kinase. Its loss of function causes discontinuous Casparian strips. SGN3 also mediates endodermal overlignification of other Casparian strip mutants. Yet, without ligand, SGN3 function remained elusive. Here we report that <i>schengen2 (sgn2)</i> is defective in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e sulfating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e ligands. On the basis of this observation, we identified two stele-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es (CASPARIAN STRIP INTEGRITY FACTORS, CIF1/2) that complement <i>sgn2</i> at nanomolar concentrations and induce Casparian strip mislocalization as well as overlignification—all of which depend on SGN3. Direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e binding to recombinant SGN3 identifies these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es as SGN3 ligands. We speculate that CIF1/2-SGN3 is part of a barrier surveillance system, evolved to guarantee effective sealing of the supracellular Casparian strip network.</p>

An artificial metalloenzyme with the kinetics of native enzymes
<p>Natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es contain highly evolved active sites that lead to fast rates and high selectivities. Although artificial metallo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es have been developed that catalyze abiological transformations with high stereoselectivity, the activities of these artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es are much lower than those of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. Here, we report a reconstituted artificial metallo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e containing an iridium porphyrin that exhibits kinetic parameters similar to those of natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es. In particular, variants of the P450 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e CYP119 containing iridium in place of iron catalyze insertions of carbenes into C–H bonds with up to 98% enantiomeric excess, 35,000 turnovers, and 2550 hours<sup>−1</sup> turnover frequency. This activity leads to intramolecular carbene insertions into unactivated C–H bonds and intermolecular carbene insertions into C–H bonds.

<i>Drosophila</i> insulin release is triggered by adipose Stunted ligand to brain Methuselah receptor
<p>Animals adapt their growth rate and body size to available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s by a general modulation of insulin–insulin-like growth factor signaling. In <i>Drosophila</i>, dietary amino acids promote the release in the hemolymph of brain insulin-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es (Dilps), which in turn activate systemic organ growth. Dilp secretion by insulin-producing cells involves a relay through unknown cytokines produced by fat cells. Here, we identify Methuselah (Mth) as a secretin-incretin receptor subfamily member required in the insulin-producing cells for proper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> coupling. We further show, using genetic and ex vivo organ culture experiments, that the Mth ligand Stunted (Sun) is a circulating insulinotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e produced by fat cells. Therefore, Sun and Mth define a new cross-organ circuitry that modulates physiological insulin levels in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant systemic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> availability. In legumes, two systemic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es produced in roots depending on soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts systemically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>es (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 systemic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor systemic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN systemic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

Predicting Dynamic Metabolic Demands in the Photosynthetic Eukaryote <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>
<p>Phototrophic organisms exhibit a highly dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>e, adapting their biomass composition in response to diurnal light/dark cycles and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> availability. Here, we used experimentally determined biomass compositions over the course of growth to determine and constrain the biomass objective function (BOF) in a genome-scale metabolic model of <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> UTEX 395 over time. Changes in the BOF, which encompasses all metabolites necessary to produce biomass, influence the state of the metabolic network thus directly affecting predictions. Simulations using dynamic BOFs predicted distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>e demands during heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth. Model-driven analysis of extracellular nitrogen concentrations and predicted nitrogen uptake rates revealed an intracellular nitrogen pool, which contains 38% of the total nitrogen provided in the medium for photoautotrophic and 13% for heterotrophic growth. Agreement between flux and gene expression trends was determined by statistical comparison. Accordance between predicted flux trends and gene expression trends was found for 65% of multisubunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es and 75% of allosteric reactions. Reactions with the highest agreement between simulations and experimental data were associated with energy metabolism, terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acids, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotid</span></strong>es, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, predicted flux distributions at each time point were compared with gene expression data to gain new insights into intracellular compartmentalization, specifically for transporters. A total of 103 genes related to internal transport reactions were identified and added to the updated model of <i>C. vulgaris</i>, <i>i</i>CZ946, thus increasing our knowledgebase by 10% for this model green alga.</p>

Mechanism of Dual Targeting of the Phytochrome Signaling Component HEMERA/pTAC12 to Plastids and the Nucleus
<p>HEMERA (HMR) is a nuclear and plastidial dual-targeted protein. While it functions in the nucleus as a transcriptional coactivator in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>e signaling to regulate a distinct set of light-responsive, growth-relevant genes, in plastids it is known as pTAC12, which associates with the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase, and is essential for inducing the plastomic photosynthetic genes and initiating chloroplast biogenesis. However, the mechanism of targeting HMR to the nucleus and plastids is still poorly understood. Here, we show that HMR can be directly imported into chloroplasts through a transit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e residing in the N-terminal 50 amino acids. Upon cleavage of the transit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e and additional proteolytic processing, mature HMR, which begins from Lys-58, retains its biochemical properties in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>e signaling. Unexpectedly, expression of mature HMR failed to rescue not only the plastidial but also the nuclear defects of the <i>hmr</i> mutant. This is because the predicted nuclear localization signals of HMR are nonfunctional, and therefore mature HMR is unable to accumulate in either plastids or the nucleus. Surprisingly, fusing the transit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>e of the small subunit of Rubisco with mature HMR rescues both its plastidial and nuclear localization and functions. These results, combined with the observation that the nuclear form of HMR has the same reduced molecular mass as plastidial HMR, support a retrograde protein translocation mechanism in which HMR is targeted first to plastids, processed to the mature form, and then relocated to the nucleus.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of carboxy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> (COHb), formed by CO binding to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong>, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myoglobin</span></strong> concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> concentration. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hemoglobin</span></strong> concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
The fraction of strongly bound cross-bridges is increased in mice that carry the myopathy-linked myosin heavy chain mutation MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>opathies have emerged as a new group of diseases and are caused by mutations in genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. One major hallmark of these diseases is skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of muscle fibers from <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i> mice, which carry a mutation that provokes an L342Q change within the catalytic domain of the type IIb skeletal muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> protein MYH4. Because homozygous animals develop rapid muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis, they must be killed by postnatal day 13, so all experiments were performed using skeletal muscles from adult heterozygous animals (<i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+). <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice contain MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup> expressed at 7% of the levels of the wild-type (WT) protein, and are overtly and histologically normal. However, mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized fibers revealed, upon maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, higher stiffness as well as altered meridional and equatorial reflections in <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice when compared with age-matched WT animals. Under rigor conditions, by contrast, no difference was observed between <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ and WT mice. Altogether, these findings prove that, in adult <i>MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup></i> heterozygous mice, the transition from weak to strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> cross-bridge binding is facilitated, increasing the number of strongly attached <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> heads, thus enhancing force production. These changes are predictably exacerbated in the type IIb fibers of homozygous mice, in which the embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> isoform is fully replaced by MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>, leading to a hypercontraction, muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>opathies.</p>

PAR-2, LGL-1 and the CDC-42 GAP CHIN-1 act in distinct pathways to maintain polarity in the <i>C. elegans</i> embryo
<p>In the one-cell <i>C. elegans</i> embryo, polarity is maintained by mutual antagonism between the anterior cortical proteins PAR-3, PKC-3, PAR-6 and CDC-42, and the posterior cortical proteins PAR-2 and LGL-1 on the posterior cortex. The mechanisms by which these proteins interact to maintain polarity are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigate the interplay among PAR-2, LGL-1, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>, the anterior PAR proteins and CDC-42. We find that PAR-2 and LGL-1 affect cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> accumulation by different mechanisms. LGL-1 does not directly antagonize the accumulation of cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> and instead plays a role in regulating PAR-6 levels. By contrast, PAR-2 likely has separate roles in regulating cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> accumulation and preventing the expansion of the anterior cortical domain. We also provide evidence that asymmetry of active CDC-42 can be maintained independently of LGL-1 and PAR-2 by a redundant pathway that includes the CDC-42 GAP CHIN-1. Finally, we show that, in addition to its primary role in regulating the size of the anterior cortical domain via its binding to PAR-6, CDC-42 has a secondary role in regulating cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> that is not dependent on PAR-6.</p>

Nicotinamide Riboside Preserves Cardiac Function in a Mouse Model of Dilated Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial metabolic impairment is a major feature in chronic heart failure. As the major co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e in fuel oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and a substrate for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es signaling energy stress and oxidative stress response, nicotinamide adenine di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotid</span></strong>e (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is emerging as a metabolic target in a number of diseases including heart failure. Little is known on the mechanisms regulating homeostasis of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the failing heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To explore possible alterations of NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in the failing heart, we quantified the expression of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es in the human failing heart and in the heart of a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) triggered by Serum Response Factor transcription factor depletion in the heart (SRF<sup>HKO</sup>) or of cardiac hypertrophy triggered by transverse aorta constriction. We studied the impact of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor supplementation on cardiac function in both mouse models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed a 30% loss in levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the murine failing heart of both DCM and transverse aorta constriction mice that was accompanied by a decrease in expression of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e that recycles the nicotinamide precursor, whereas the nicotinamide riboside kinase 2 (NMRK2) that phosphorylates the nicotinamide riboside precursor is increased, to a higher level in the DCM (40-fold) than in transverse aorta constriction (4-fold). This shift was also observed in human failing heart biopsies in comparison with nonfailing controls. We show that the <i>Nmrk2</i> gene is an AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α responsive gene that is activated by energy stress and NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Nicotinamide riboside efficiently rescues NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis in response to FK866-mediated inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and stimulates glycolysis in cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, we show that nicotinamide riboside supplementation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> attenuates the development of heart failure in mice, more robustly in DCM, and partially after transverse aorta constriction, by stabilizing myocardial NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the failing heart. Nicotinamide riboside treatment also robustly increases the myocardial levels of 3 metabolites, nicotinic acid adenine di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleotid</span></strong>e, methylnicotinamide, and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, that can be used as validation biomarkers for the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data show that nicotinamide riboside, the most energy-efficient among NAD precursors, could be useful for treatment of heart failure, notably in the context of DCM, a disease with few therapeutic options.</p></sec>

CSL112 is an infusible, plasma-derived apoA-I that has been studied in normal subjects or those with stable coronary artery disease. This study aimed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CSL112 in patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The AEGIS-I trial (Apo-I Event Reducing in Ischemic Syndromes I) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2b trial. Patients with myocardial infarction were stratified by renal function and randomized 1:1:1 to CSL112 (2 g apoA-I per dose) and high-dose CSL112 (6 g apoA-I per dose), or placebo for 4 consecutive weekly infusions. Coprimary safety end points were occurrence of either a hepatic safety event (an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alanin</span></strong>e transaminase >3 times the upper limit of normal or an increase in total bilirubin >2 times the upper limit of normal) or a renal safety event (an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">serum</span></strong> creatinine >1.5 times the baseline value or a new requirement for renal replacement therapy).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1258 patients were randomized, and 91.2% received all 4 infusions. The difference in incidence rates for an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alanin</span></strong>e transaminase or total bilirubin between both CSL112 arms and placebo was within the protocol-defined noninferiority margin of 4%. Similarly, the difference in incidence rates for an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">serum</span></strong> creatinine or a new requirement for renal replacement therapy was within the protocol-defined noninferiority margin of 5%. CSL112 was associated with increases in apoA-I and ex vivo cholesterol efflux similar to that achieved in patients with stable coronary artery disease. In regard to the secondary efficacy end point, the risk for the composite of major adverse cardiovascular events among the groups was similar.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with acute myocardial infarction, 4 weekly infusions of CSL112 are feasible, well tolerated, and not associated with any significant alterations in liver or kidney function or other safety concern. The ability of CSL112 to acutely enhance cholesterol efflux was confirmed. The potential benefit of CSL112 to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events needs to be assessed in an adequately powered phase 3 trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Proteome-Wide Analysis of Cysteine Reactivity during Effector-Triggered Immunity
<p>A surge in the accumulation of oxidants generates shifts in the cellular redox potential during early stages of plant infection with pathogens and activation of effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The redoxome, defined as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>e-wide oxidative modifications of proteins caused by oxidants, has a well-known impact on stress responses in metazoans. However, the identity of proteins and the residues sensitive to oxidation during the plant immune response remain largely unknown. Previous studies of the thimet oligo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peptid</span></strong>ases TOP1 and TOP2 placed them in the salicylic acid dependent branch of ETI, with a current model wherein TOPs sustain interconnected organellar and cytosolic pathways that modulate the oxidative burst and development of cell death. Herein, we characterized the ETI redoxomes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) wild-type Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> mutant plants using a differential alkylation-based enrichment technique coupled with label-free mass spectrometry-based quantification. We identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>es sensitive to oxidation in a wide range of protein families at multiple time points after pathogen infection. Differences were detected between Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> redoxomes regarding the identity and number of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cystein</span></strong>es, and the amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in protein oxidation. Our results support a determining role for TOPs in maintaining the proper level and dynamics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>e oxidation during ETI. This study significantly expands the repertoire of oxidation-sensitive plant proteins and can guide future mechanistic studies.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, plants experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which plants integrate these environmental cues to maintain plant growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>E A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato plants, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>e, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phytochrom</span></strong>e A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which plants integrate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that plants have evolved for growth and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation
<p>Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is coproduced with ethylene in plant cells and is primarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>atically detoxified by the mitochondrial β-CYANOALANINE SYNTHASE (CAS-C1). Permanent or transient depletion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alterations in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>ic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in protein content, identifying 451 proteins that are absent or less abundant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 proteins that are only present or more abundant in <i>cas-c1</i>. Gene ontology classification of these proteins identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>ic changes that explain the root hairless phenotype and the altered immune response observed in the <i>cas-c1</i> mutant. The mechanism of action of cyanide as a signaling molecule was addressed using two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proteom</span></strong>ic approaches aimed at identifying the <i>S-</i>cyanylation of Cys as a posttranslational modification of proteins. Both the 2-imino-thiazolidine chemical method and the direct untargeted analysis of proteins using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified a set of 163 proteins susceptible to <i>S-</i>cyanylation that included SEDOHEPTULOSE 1,7-BISPHOSPHATASE (SBPase), the PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE 20-3 (CYP20-3), and ENOLASE2 (ENO2). In vitro analysis of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation of SBPase Cys<sup>74</sup>, CYP20-3 Cys<sup>259</sup>, and ENO2 Cys<sup>346</sup> residues affected their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>atic activity. Gene Ontology classification and protein-protein interaction cluster analysis showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation is involved in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, and the Calvin and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met cycles.</p>

The Phosphate Fast-Responsive Genes <i>PECP1</i> and <i>PPsPase1</i> Affect Phosphocholine and Phosphoethanolamine Content<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Phosphate starvation-mediated induction of the HAD-type phosphatases PPsPase1 (AT1G73010) and PECP1 (AT1G17710) has been reported in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, little is known about their in vivo function or impact on plant responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> deficiency. The preferences of PPsPase1 and PECP1 for different substrates have been studied in vitro but require confirmation in planta. Here, we examined the in vivo function of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es using a reverse genetics approach. We demonstrated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 affect plant phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine content, but not the pyrophosphate-related phenotypes. These observations suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es play a similar role in planta related to the recycling of polar heads from membrane lipids that is triggered during phosphate starvation. Altering the expression of the genes encoding these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">enzym</span></strong>es had no effect on lipid composition, possibly due to compensation by other lipid recycling pathways triggered during phosphate starvation. Furthermore, our results indicated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 do not influence phosphate homeostasis, since the inactivation of these genes had no effect on phosphate content or on the induction of molecular markers related to phosphate starvation. A combination of transcriptomics and imaging analyses revealed that PPsPase1 and PECP1 display a highly dynamic expression pattern that closely mirrors the phosphate status. This temporal dynamism, combined with the wide range of induction levels, broad expression, and lack of a direct effect on Pi content and regulation, makes PPsPase1 and PECP1 useful molecular markers of the phosphate starvation response.</p>

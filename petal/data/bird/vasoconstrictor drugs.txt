Common Genetic Variant Risk Score Is Associated With Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced QT interval prolongation, a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications. The contribution of common genetic variants previously associated with baseline QT interval to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced QT prolongation and arrhythmias is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that a weighted combination of common genetic variants contributing to QT interval at baseline, identified through genome-wide association studies, can predict individual response to multiple QT-prolonging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s. Genetic analysis of 22 subjects was performed in a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 3 QT-prolonging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s with 15 time-matched QT and plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> concentration measurements. Subjects received single doses of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and placebo. The outcome was the correlation between a genetic QT score comprising 61 common genetic variants and the slope of an individual subject’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced increase in heart rate–corrected QT (QTc) versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The genetic QT score was correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced QTc prolongation. Among white subjects, genetic QT score explained 30% of the variability in response to dofetilide (<i>r</i>=0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.81; <i>P</i>=0.02), 23% in response to quinidine (<i>r</i>=0.48; 95% confidence interval, −0.03 to 0.79; <i>P</i>=0.06), and 27% in response to ranolazine (<i>r</i>=0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.80; <i>P</i>=0.03). Furthermore, the genetic QT score was a significant predictor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced torsade de pointes in an independent sample of 216 cases compared with 771 controls (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=12%, <i>P</i>=1×10<sup>−7</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We demonstrate that a genetic QT score comprising 61 common genetic variants explains a significant proportion of the variability in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced QT prolongation and is a significant predictor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced torsade de pointes. These findings highlight an opportunity for recent genetic discoveries to improve individualized risk-benefit assessment for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pharmacolog</span></strong>ical therapies. Replication of these findings in larger samples is needed to more precisely estimate variance explained and to establish the individual variants that drive these effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Nonshockable-Turned-Shockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) commonly presents with nonshockable rhythms (asystole and pulseless electric activity). It is unknown whether antiarrhythmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s are safe and effective when nonshockable rhythms evolve to shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VF/VT]) during resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with nontraumatic OHCA, vascular access, and VF/VT anytime after ≥1 shock(s) were prospectively randomized, double-blind, to receive amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo by paramedics. Patients presenting with initial shock-refractory VF/VT were previously reported. The current study was a prespecified analysis in a separate cohort that initially presented with nonshockable OHCA and was randomized on subsequently developing shock-refractory VF/VT. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included discharge functional status and adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-related effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 37 889 patients with OHCA, 3026 with initial VF/VT and 1063 with initial nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were treatment-eligible, were randomized, and received their assigned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>. Baseline characteristics among patients with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Active-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> recipients in this cohort required fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>, and ancillary antiarrhythmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s than recipients of a placebo (<i>P</i><0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital discharge (<i>P</i>=0.24). No significant interaction between treatment assignment and discharge survival occurred with the initiating OHCA rhythm (asystole, pulseless electric activity, or VF/VT). Survival in each of these categories was consistently higher with active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s, although the trends were not statistically significant. Adjusted absolute differences (95% confidence interval) in survival from nonshockable-turned-shockable arrhythmias with amiodarone versus placebo were 2.3% (−0.3, 4.8), <i>P</i>=0.08, and for lidocaine versus placebo 1.2% (−1.1, 3.6), <i>P</i>=0.30. More than 50% of these survivors were functionally independent or required minimal assistance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-related adverse effects were infrequent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Outcome from nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA is poor but not invariably fatal. Although not statistically significant, point estimates for survival were greater after amiodarone or lidocaine than placebo, without increased risk of adverse effects or disability and consistent with previously observed favorable trends from treatment of initial shock-refractory VF/VT with these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s.

Medical Therapy for Secondary Prevention and Long-Term Outcome in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 5% to 10% of all patients with myocardial infarction. Clinical trials of secondary prevention treatment in MINOCA patients are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between treatment with statins, renin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> system blockers, β-blockers, dual antiplatelet therapy, and long-term cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This is an observational study of MINOCA patients recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) between July 2003 and June 2013 and followed until December 2013 for outcome events in the Swedish Cause of Death Register and National Patient Register. Of 199 162 myocardial infarction admissions, 9466 consecutive unique patients with MINOCA were identified. Among those, the 9136 patients surviving the first 30 days after discharge constituted the study population. Mean age was 65.3 years, and 61% were women. No patient was lost to follow-up. A stratified propensity score analysis was performed to match treated and untreated groups. The association between treatment and outcome was estimated by comparing between treated and untreated groups by using Cox proportional hazards models. The exposures were treatment at discharge with statins, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme inhibitors/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events defined as all-cause mortality, hospitalization for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At discharge, 84.5%, 64.1%, 83.4%, and 66.4% of the patients were on statins, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme inhibitors/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively. During the follow-up of a mean of 4.1 years, 2183 (23.9%) patients experienced a major adverse cardiac event. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for major adverse cardiac events were 0.77 (0.68–0.87), 0.82 (0.73–0.93), and 0.86 (0.74–1.01) in patients on statins, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme inhibitors/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> receptor blockers, and β-blockers, respectively. For patients on dual antiplatelet therapy followed for 1 year, the hazard ratio was 0.90 (0.74–1.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The results indicate long-term beneficial effects of treatment with statins and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme inhibitors/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> receptor blockers on outcome in patients with MINOCA, a trend toward a positive effect of β-blocker treatment, and a neutral effect of dual antiplatelet therapy. Properly powered randomized clinical trials to confirm these results are warranted.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> attrition during pharmaceutical development and has resulted in numerous preventable patient deaths. Incidents of adverse cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> reactions are more common in patients with preexisting heart disease than the general population. Here we generated a library of human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from patients with various hereditary cardiac disorders to model differences in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> toxicity susceptibility for patients of different genetic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Action potential duration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced arrhythmia were measured at the single cell level in hiPSC-CMs derived from healthy subjects and patients with hereditary long QT syndrome, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and familial dilated cardiomyopathy.

A Nanoparticle-Based Combination Chemotherapy Delivery System for Enhanced Tumor Killing by Dynamic Rewiring of Signaling Pathways
<sec><title>Timing the One-Two Punch</title><p>Morton <i>et al</i>. developed a dual-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>, time-delayed nanoparticle delivery system for treating cancer.

Separating host and microbiome contributions to drug pharmacokinetics and toxicity
<p>The gut microbiota is implicated in the metabolism of many medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s, with consequences for interpersonal variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> efficacy and toxicity. However, quantifying microbial contributions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> metabolism is challenging, particularly in cases where host and microbiome perform the same metabolic transformation. We combined gut commensal genetics with gnotobiotics to measure brivudine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> metabolism across tissues in mice that vary in a single microbiome-encoded enzyme. Informed by these measurements, we built a pharmacokinetic model that quantitatively predicts microbiome contributions to systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> and metabolite exposure, as a function of bioavailability, host and microbial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-metabolizing activity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> and metabolite absorption, and intestinal transit kinetics. Clonazepam studies illustrate how this approach disentangles microbiome contributions to metabolism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s subject to multiple metabolic routes and transformations.</p>

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of metabolites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been achieved via metabolic engineering in cereals, but the potential connection between metabolic engineering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of engineered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key metabolites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">serotonin</span></strong> biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely linked with dark-brown endosperm color in HFL rice. A functional connection between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">serotonin</span></strong> and endosperm color was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">serotonin</span></strong> biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">serotonin</span></strong> accumulation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the metabolic connection between Lys and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">serotonin</span></strong> metabolism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">serotonin</span></strong> accumulation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid metabolism in rice. In addition, the finding that both Lys and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">serotonin</span></strong> accumulate in HFL rice grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable crop.</p>

The target landscape of clinical kinase drugs
<p>Kinase inhibitors are important cancer therapeutics. Poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pharmacolog</span></strong>y is commonly observed, requiring thorough target deconvolution to understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> mechanism of action. Using chemical proteomics, we analyzed the target spectrum of 243 clinically evaluated kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s. The data revealed previously unknown targets for established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s, offered a perspective on the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>gable” kinome, highlighted (non)kinase off-targets, and suggested potential therapeutic applications. Integration of phosphoproteomic data refined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-affected pathways, identified response markers, and strengthened rationale for combination treatments. We exemplify translational value by discovering SIK2 (salt-inducible kinase 2) inhibitors that modulate cytokine production in primary cells, by identifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s against the lung cancer survival marker MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase), and by repurposing cabozantinib to treat FLT3-ITD–positive acute myeloid leukemia.

Covalent inhibitors of EGFR family protein kinases induce degradation of human Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) pseudokinase in cancer cells
<p>A major challenge associated with biochemical and cellular analysis of pseudokinases is a lack of target-validated small-molecule compounds with which to probe function. Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with a diverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There is substantial evidence that human TRIB2 promotes survival and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> resistance in solid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutic target. The unusual TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-rich C-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminal tail, which also supports its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases. We found that TRIB2 is a target of previously described small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinase domains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Using a thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB2-binding compounds within the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and used a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> repurposing approach to classify compounds that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB2 in vitro. TRIB2 destabilizing agents, including the covalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> afatinib, led to rapid TRIB2 degradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signaling and survival. Our data reveal new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> leads for the development of TRIB2-degrading compounds, which will also be invaluable for unraveling the cellular mechanisms of TRIB2-based signaling. Our study highlights that small molecule–induced protein down-regulation through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> “off-targets” might be relevant for other inhibitors that serendipitously target pseudokinases.</p>

Developmental phosphoproteomics identifies the kinase CK2 as a driver of Hedgehog signaling and a therapeutic target in medulloblastoma
<p>A major limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> resistance, which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> target or through intrinsic resistance of subpopulations of tumor cells. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain tumor, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-resistant. To find new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to common resistance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins commonly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 inhibitors decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB tumors that were resistant to currently available Hh inhibitors, thereby extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> may avoid at least one common mode of acquired resistance. These findings suggest that CK2 inhibitors may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.</p>

Bmal1 in Perivascular Adipose Tissue Regulates Resting-Phase Blood Pressure Through Transcriptional Regulation of Angiotensinogen
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding vessels constitutes a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature required to preserve vascular tone under physiological conditions. However, there is little information on the relationship between PVAT and blood pressure regulation, including its potential contributions to circadian blood pressure variation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using unique brown adipocyte–specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>ogen knockout mice, we determined the vasoactivity of homogenized PVAT in aortic rings and how brown adipocyte peripheral expression of Bmal1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>ogen in PVAT regulates the amplitude of diurnal change in blood pressure in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We uncovered a peripheral clock in PVAT and demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 in PVAT reduces blood pressure in mice during the resting phase, leading to a superdipper phenotype. PVAT extracts from wild-type mice significantly induced contractility of isolated aortic rings in vitro in an endothelium-independent manner. This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte–selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II, operating through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II type 1 receptor–dependent signaling in the isolated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>ogen. Indeed, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>ogen mRNA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced. Systemic infusion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II, in turn, reduced Bmal1 expression in PVAT while eliminating the hypotensive phenotype during the resting phase in BA-Bmal1-KO mice. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>ogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective deletion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>ogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective deletion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>ogen is a transcriptional target of Bmal1 in PVAT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data indicate that local Bmal1 in PVAT regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>ogen expression and the ensuing increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II, which acts on smooth muscle cells in the vessel walls to regulate vasoactivity and blood pressure in a circadian fashion during the resting phase. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the cardiovascular complications of circadian disorders, alterations in the circadian dipping phenotype, and cross-talk between systemic and peripheral regulation of blood pressure.</p></sec>

Distinct Regulatory Effects of Myeloid Cell and Endothelial Cell NAPDH Oxidase 2 on Blood Pressure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hypertension caused by increased renin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> system activation is associated with elevated reactive oxygen species production. Previous studies implicate NADPH oxidase (Nox) proteins as important reactive oxygen species sources during renin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> system activation, with different Nox isoforms being potentially involved. Among these, Nox2 is expressed in multiple cell types, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells, and microglia. Blood pressure (BP) is regulated at the central nervous system, renal, and vascular levels, but the cell-specific role of Nox2 in BP regulation is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We generated a novel mouse model with a floxed Nox2 gene and used Tie2-Cre, LysM Cre, or Cdh5-CreERT2 driver lines to develop cell-specific models of Nox2 perturbation to investigate its role in BP regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Unexpectedly, Nox2 deletion in myeloid but not endothelial cells resulted in a significant reduction in basal BP. Both Tie2-CreNox2 knockout (KO) mice (in which Nox2 was deficient in both endothelial cells and myeloid cells) and LysM CreNox2KO mice (in which Nox2 was deficient in myeloid cells) had significantly lower BP than littermate controls, whereas basal BP was unaltered in Cdh5-CreERT2 Nox2KO mice (in which Nox2 is deficient only in endothelial cells). The lower BP was attributable to an increased NO bioavailability that dynamically dilated resistance vessels in vivo under basal conditions without a change in renal function.

In addition to the injustice of unfair advantage for dishonest athletes, significant potential health risks are associated with performance-enhancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s. Performance-enhancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s may have an effect on the cardiovascular system by means of directly altering the myocardium, vasculature, and metabolism. However, less frequently considered is the potential for indirect effects caused through enabling athletes to push beyond normal physiological limits with the potential consequence of exercise-induced arrhythmias. This review will summarize the known health effects of PEDs but will also focus on the potentially greater health threat posed by the covert search for performance-enhancing agents that have yet to be recognized by the World Anti-Doping Agency. History has taught us that athletes are subjected to unmonitored trials with experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s that have little or no established efficacy or safety data. One approach to decrease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> abuse in sports would be to accept that there is a delay from when athletes start experimenting with novel agents to the time when authorities become aware of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s. This provides a window of opportunity for athletes to exploit with relative immunity. It could be argued that all off-label use of any agent should be deemed illegal.</p>

Essential roles of AMPA receptor GluA1 phosphorylation and presynaptic HCN channels in fast-acting antidepressant responses of ketamine
<p>Although the molecular mechanism is not clear, the clinically tested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> ketamine has rapid antidepressant action that does not require the multiple weeks of treatment needed for other antidepressant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s to have an effect. We showed that ketamine potentiated Schaffer collateral–CA1 cell excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slice preparations from rodents and enhanced the phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit on Ser<sup>845</sup> of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor in the hippocampal area CA1. These effects persisted when γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pharmacolog</span></strong>ically blocked. Ketamine reduced behavioral despair in wild-type mice but had no effect in GluA1 S845A knock-in mutant mice. Presynaptic (CA3 pyramidal cell), but not postsynaptic (CA1 pyramidal cell), deletion of <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA)–type glutamate receptors eliminated the ketamine-induced enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices and the antidepressant actions of ketamine in mice. The synaptic and behavioral actions of ketamine were completely occluded by inhibition or deletion of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated channel 1 (HCN1). Our results implicate presynaptic NMDA receptor inhibition followed by reduced activity of presynaptic HCN1 channels, which would result in an increase in glutamate release and postsynaptic glutamate receptor activity, as a mechanism of ketamine action. These data provide a mechanism for changes in synaptic activity that could explain the fast-acting antidepressant effects of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pharmacolog</span></strong>y and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the diffusion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average diffusion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the diffusion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average diffusion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

Inflammatory but not mitogenic contexts prime synovial fibroblasts for compensatory signaling responses to p38 inhibition
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that causes joint pain, swelling, and loss of function. Development of effective new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s has proven challenging in part because of the complexities and interconnected nature of intracellular signaling networks that complicate the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pharmacolog</span></strong>ical interventions. We characterized the kinase signaling pathways that are activated in RA and evaluated the multivariate effects of targeted inhibitors. Synovial fluids from RA patients activated the kinase signaling pathways JAK, JNK, p38, and MEK in synovial fibroblasts (SFs), a stromal cell type that promotes RA progression. Kinase inhibitors enhanced signaling of “off-target” pathways in a manner dependent on stimulatory context. Inhibitors of p38, which have been widely explored in clinical trials for RA, resulted in undesirable increases in nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JNK, and MEK signaling in SFs in inflammatory, but not mitogenic, contexts. This was mediated by the transcription factor CREB, which functions in part within a negative feedback loop in MAPK signaling. CREB activation was induced predominately by p38 in response to inflammatory stimuli, but by MEK in response to mitogenic stimuli; hence, the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s targeting p38 or MEK were markedly different in SFs cultured under mitogenic or inflammatory conditions. Together, these findings illustrate how stimulatory context can alter dominance in pathway cross-talk even for a fixed network topology, thereby providing a rationale for why p38 inhibitors deliver limited benefits in RA and demonstrating the need for careful consideration of p38-targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s in inflammation-related disorders.</p>

Discovery and inhibition of an interspecies gut bacterial pathway for Levodopa metabolism
<p>The human gut microbiota metabolizes the Parkinson’s disease medication Levodopa (<sc>l</sc>-dopa), potentially reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> availability and causing side effects. However, the organisms, genes, and enzymes responsible for this activity in patients and their susceptibility to inhibition by host-targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s are unknown. Here, we describe an interspecies pathway for gut bacterial <sc>l</sc>-dopa metabolism. Conversion of <sc>l</sc>-dopa to dopamine by a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent tyrosine decarboxylase from <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> is followed by transformation of dopamine to <i>m</i>-tyramine by a molybdenum-dependent dehydroxylase from <i>Eggerthella lenta</i>. These enzymes predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> metabolism in complex human gut microbiotas. Although a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> that targets host aromatic amino acid decarboxylase does not prevent gut microbial <sc>l</sc>-dopa decarboxylation, we identified a compound that inhibits this activity in Parkinson’s patient microbiotas and increases <sc>l</sc>-dopa bioavailability in mice.</p>

Toward a chemical vaccine for malaria
<p>Despite considerable progress in combating malaria, it remains one of the world's most important infectious diseases, with 50% of the world population at risk of developing the disease and a mortality rate of ∼0.5 million annually (<i>1</i>). The lack of an effective vaccine and the relentless ability of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite responsible for malaria to develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> resistance has contributed to the continuing disease burden (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of current treatment regimens, but decreased effectiveness, particularly in Southeast Asia, threatens our ability to control this disease. A global effort to develop new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s for the treatment and prevention of malaria is under way but not guaranteed to succeed (<i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). These efforts include a systematic attempt to target all life-cycle stages of the parasite to allow combination therapies to be developed, which are also likely to reduce the development of resistance. High-throughput screens (HTSs) designed to identify small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-like molecules that prevent growth of blood-stage parasites (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and target-based approaches have identified new compounds that are currently in preclinical development and/or various stages of human clinical trials for treatment of malaria (<i>3</i>). Missing from these efforts has been a high-throughput technology to find liver stage–specific chemotypes. On page 1129 of this issue, Antonova-Koch <i>et al.</i> (<i>9</i>) report an HTS effort that has filled this gap. They identify a substantial number of new chemical starting points with potent liver-stage antimalarial activity, promising a new capacity to feed compounds through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> development pipeline for chemoprotection.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular genetic variation onto phenotypic trait variation. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene effects with patterns of phenotypic trait co-variation. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> environments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from mutational pleiotropic variation to phenotypic co-variation, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP map of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP map match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main effects of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

Extracellular Matrix Proteomics Reveals Interplay of Aggrecan and Aggrecanases in Vascular Remodeling of Stented Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling contributes to in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Despite its important clinical implications, little is known about ECM changes post–stent implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Bare-metal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-eluting stents were implanted in pig coronary arteries with an overstretch under optical coherence tomography guidance. Stented segments were harvested 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-stenting for proteomics analysis of the media and neointima.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 151 ECM and ECM-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. After stent implantation, proteins involved in regulating calcification were upregulated in the neointima of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-eluting stents. The earliest changes in the media were proteins involved in inflammation and thrombosis, followed by changes in regulatory ECM proteins. By day 28, basement membrane proteins were reduced in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-eluting stents in comparison with bare-metal stents. In contrast, the large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was increased. Aggrecanases of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family contribute to the catabolism of vascular proteoglycans. An increase in ADAMTS-specific aggrecan fragments was accompanied by a notable shift from <i>ADAMTS1</i> and <i>ADAMTS5</i> to <i>ADAMTS4</i> gene expression after stent implantation. Immunostaining in human stented coronary arteries confirmed the presence of aggrecan and aggrecan fragments, in particular, at the contacts of the stent struts with the artery. Further investigation of aggrecan presence in the human vasculature revealed that aggrecan and aggrecan cleavage were more abundant in human arteries than in human veins. In addition, aggrecan synthesis was induced on grafting a vein into the arterial circulation, suggesting an important role for aggrecan in vascular plasticity. Finally, lack of ADAMTS-5 activity in mice resulted in an accumulation of aggrecan and a dilation of the thoracic aorta, confirming that aggrecanase activity regulates aggrecan abundance in the arterial wall and contributes to vascular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant differences were identified by proteomics in the ECM of coronary arteries after bare-metal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-eluting stent implantation, most notably an upregulation of aggrecan, a major ECM component of cartilaginous tissues that confers resistance to compression. The accumulation of aggrecan coincided with a shift in <i>ADAMTS</i> gene expression. This study provides the first evidence implicating aggrecan and aggrecanases in the vascular injury response after stenting.</p></sec>

Hospital Variation in Adherence Rates to Secondary Prevention Medications and the Implications on Quality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Medication adherence is important to improve the long-term outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (MI). We hypothesized that there is significant variation among US hospitals in terms of medication adherence after MI, and that patients treated at hospitals with higher medication adherence after MI will have better long-term cardiovascular outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified 19 704 Medicare patients discharged after acute MI from 347 US hospitals participating in the ACTION Registry-GWTG (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines) from January 2, 2007, to October 1, 2010. Using linked Medicare Part D prescription filling data, medication adherence was defined as proportion of days covered >80% within 90 days after discharge. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compare 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events among hospitals with high, moderate, and low 90-day medication adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By 90 days after MI, overall rates of adherence to medications prescribed at discharge were 68% for β-blockers, 63% for statins, 64% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme inhibitors/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> receptor blockers, and 72% for thienopyridines. Adherence to these medications up to 90 days varied significantly among hospitals: β-blockers (proportion of days covered >80%; 59% to 75%), statins (55% to 69%), thienopyridines (64% to 77%), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme inhibitors/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> receptor blockers (57% to 69%). Compared with hospitals in the lowest quartile of 90-day composite medication adherence, hospitals with the highest adherence had lower unadjusted and adjusted 2-year major adverse cardiovascular event risk (27.5% versus 35.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.96). High-adherence hospitals also had lower adjusted rates of death or readmission (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.96), whereas there was no difference in mortality after adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of secondary prevention medications after discharge varies significantly among US hospitals and is inversely associated with 2-year outcomes.

Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type I Controls Cardiomyocyte Transforming Growth Factor-β and Cardiac Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Fibrosis is the pathological consequence of stress-induced tissue remodeling and matrix accumulation. Increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) have been shown to promote fibrosis in multiple organ systems. Paradoxically, homozygous genetic deficiency of PAI-1 is associated with spontaneous age-dependent, cardiac-selective fibrosis in mice. We have identified a novel PAI-1-dependent mechanism that regulates cardiomyocyte-derived fibrogenic signals and cardiac transcriptional pathways during injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis in subjects with homozygous mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i> was evaluated with late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A murine cardiac injury model was performed by subcutaneous infusion of either saline or Angiotensin II by osmotic minipumps. We evaluated blood pressure, cardiac function (by echocardiography), fibrosis (with Masson Trichrome staining), and apoptosis (with TUNEL staining), and we performed transcriptome analysis (with RNA sequencing). We further evaluated fibrotic signaling in isolated murine primary ventricular myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis was detected in 2 otherwise healthy humans with complete PAI-1 deficiency because of a homozygous frameshift mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i>. In addition to its suppressive role during spontaneous cardiac fibrosis in multiple species, we hypothesized that PAI-1 also regulates fibrosis during cardiac injury. Treatment of young PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice with Angiotensin II induced extensive hypertrophy and fibrotic cardiomyopathy, with increased cardiac apoptosis and both reactive and replacement fibrosis. Although Angiotensin II-induced hypertension was blunted in PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, cardiac hypertrophy was accelerated. Furthermore, ventricular myocytes were found to be an important source of cardiac transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and PAI-1 regulated TGF-β synthesis by cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as in vivo during cardiac injury. Transcriptome analysis of ventricular RNA after Angiotensin II treatment confirmed that PAI-1 deficiency significantly enhanced multiple TGF-β signaling elements and transcriptional targets, including genes for extracellular matrix components, mediators of extracellular matrix remodeling, matricellular proteins, and cardiac integrins compared with wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PAI-1 is an essential re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pressor</span></strong> of cardiac fibrosis in mammals. We define a novel cardiomyocyte-specific regulatory mechanism for TGF-β production by PAI-1, which explains the paradoxical effect of PAI-1 deficiency in promoting cardiac-selective fibrosis. Thus, PAI-1 is a molecular switch that controls the cardiac TGF-β axis and its early transcriptional effects that lead to myocardial fibrosis.</p></sec>

Female Mice With an XY Sex Chromosome Complement Develop Severe Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a deadly pathology with strong sexual dimorphism. Similar to humans, female mice exhibit far lower incidences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced AAAs than males. In addition to sex hormones, the X and Y sex chromosomes, and their unique complements of genes, may contribute to sexually dimorphic AAA pathology. Here, we defined the effect of female (XX) versus male (XY) sex chromosome complement on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced AAA formation and rupture in phenotypically female mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Female low-density lipoprotein receptor (<i>Ldlr</i>) deficient mice with an XX or XY sex chromosome complement were infused with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II for 28 days to induce AAAs. Abdominal aortic lumen diameters were quantified by ultrasound, whereas AAA diameters were quantified at study end point. DNA microarrays were performed on abdominal aortas. To mimic males, female mice were administered a single dose of testosterone as neonates or as adults before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II infusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Female <i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup> deficient mice with an XX and XY sex chromosome complement had similar sex organ weights and low serum testosterone concentrations. Abdominal aortas from female XY mice selectively expressed Y chromosome genes, whereas genes known to escape X inactivation were higher in XX females. The majority of aortic gene differences in XY versus XX females fell within inflammatory pathways. AAA incidences doubled and aneurysms ruptured in XY females. AAAs from XY females exhibited inflammation, and plasma interleukin-1β concentrations were increased in XY females. Moreover, aortas from XY females had augmented matrix metalloproteinase activity and increased oxidative stress. Last, testosterone exposure applied chronically, or as a single bolus at postnatal day 1, markedly worsened AAA outcomes in XY in comparison with XX adult females.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An XY sex chromosome complement in phenotypic females profoundly influenced aortic gene expression profiles and promoted AAA severity. When XY females were exposed to testosterone, aneurysm rupture rates were striking. Mechanisms for augmented AAA severity in XY females include increased inflammation, augmented matrix metalloproteineases, and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that genes on the sex chromosomes regulate aortic vascular biology and contribute to sexual dimorphism of AAAs. Sex chromosome genes may serve as novel targets for sex-specific AAA therapeutics.</p></sec>

Long-Term Biased β-Arrestin Signaling Improves Cardiac Structure and Function in Dilated Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Biased agonism of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II receptor is known to promote cardiac contractility. Our laboratory indicated that these effects may be attributable to changes at the level of the myofilaments. However, these signaling mechanisms remain unknown. Because a common finding in dilated cardiomyopathy is a reduction in the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response, we hypothesized that β-arrestin signaling would increase myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> responsiveness in a model of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and improve cardiac function and morphology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We treated a dilated cardiomyopathy–linked mouse model expressing a mutant tropomyosin (Tm-E54K) for 3 months with either TRV120067, a β-arrestin 2–biased ligand of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II receptor, or losartan, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II receptor blocker. At the end of the treatment protocol, we assessed cardiac function using echocardiography, the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response of detergent-extracted fiber bundles, and used proteomic approaches to understand changes in posttranslational modifications of proteins that may explain functional changes. We also assessed signaling pathways altered in vivo and by using isolated myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>TRV120067- treated Tm-E54K mice showed improved cardiac structure and function, whereas losartan-treated mice had no improvement. Myofilaments of TRV120067-treated Tm-E54K mice had significantly improved myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> responsiveness, which was depressed in untreated Tm-E54K mice. We attributed these changes to increased MLC2v and MYPT1/2 phosphorylation seen only in TRV120067-treated mice. We found that the functional changes were attributable to an activation of ERK1/2-RSK3 signaling, mediated through β-arrestin, which may have a novel role in increasing MLC2v phosphorylation through a previously unrecognized interaction of β-arrestin localized to the sarcomere.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Long-term β-arrestin 2–biased agonism of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II receptor may be a viable approach to the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy by not only preventing maladaptive signaling, but also improving cardiac function by altering the myofilament-Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> response via β-arrestin signaling pathways.</p></sec>

A unique type of GSK-3 inhibitor brings new opportunities to the clinic
<p>Development of protein kinase inhibitors is a focus of many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> discovery programs. A major problem, however, is the limited specificity of the commonly used adenosine triphosphate–competitive inhibitors and the weak inhibition of the more selective substrate-competitive inhibitors. Glycogen synthase kinase–3 (GSK-3) is a promising <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> target for treating neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but most GSK-3 inhibitors have not reached the clinic. We describe a new type of GSK-3 inhibitor, L807mts, that acts through a substrate-to-inhibitor conversion mechanism that occurs within the catalytic site of the enzyme. We determined that L807mts was a potent and highly selective GSK-3 inhibitor with reasonable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pharmacolog</span></strong>ical and safety properties when tested in rodents. Treatment with L807mts enhanced the clearance of β-amyloid loads, reduced inflammation, enhanced autophagic flux, and improved cognitive and social skills in the 5XFAD AD mouse model. This new modality of GSK-3 inhibition may be therapeutic in patients with AD or other central nervous system disorders associated with dysregulated GSK-3.</p>

Identification of Toll-like receptor signaling inhibitors based on selective activation of hierarchically acting signaling proteins
<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize various pathogen- and host tissue–derived molecules and initiate inflammatory immune responses. Exaggerated or prolonged TLR activation, however, can lead to etiologically diverse diseases, such as bacterial sepsis, metabolic and autoimmune diseases, or stroke. Despite the apparent medical need, no small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s against TLR pathways are clinically available. This may be because of the complex signaling mechanisms of TLRs, which are governed by a series of protein-protein interactions initiated by Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology domains (TIR) found in TLRs and the cytoplasmic adaptor proteins TIRAP and MyD88. Oligomerization of TLRs with MyD88 or TIRAP leads to the recruitment of members of the IRAK family of kinases and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. We developed a phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> screening system based on the inducible homodimerization of either TIRAP, MyD88, or TRAF6, that ranked hits according to their hierarchy of action. From a bioactive compound library, we identified methyl-piperidino-pyrazole (MPP) as a TLR-specific inhibitor. Structure-activity relationship analysis, quantitative proteomics, protein-protein interaction assays, and cellular thermal shift assays suggested that MPP targets the TIR domain of MyD88. Chemical evolution of the original MPP scaffold generated compounds with selectivity for distinct TLRs that interfered with specific TIR interactions. Administration of an MPP analog to mice protected them from TLR4-dependent inflammation. These results validate this phenotypic screening approach and suggest that the MPP scaffold could serve as a starting point for the development of anti-inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s.</p>

Subtle modifications to oxytocin produce ligands that retain potency and improved selectivity across species
<p>Oxytocin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasopressin</span></strong> mediate various physiological functions that are important for osmoregulation, reproduction, cardiovascular function, social behavior, memory, and learning through four G protein–coupled receptors that are also implicated in high-profile disorders. Targeting these receptors is challenging because of the difficulty in obtaining ligands that retain selectivity across rodents and humans for translational studies. We identified a selective and more stable oxytocin receptor (OTR) agonist by subtly modifying the pharmacophore framework of human oxytocin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasopressin</span></strong>. [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH displayed similar potency to oxytocin but improved selectivity for OTR, an effect that was retained in mice. Centrally infused [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH potently reversed social fear in mice, confirming that this action was mediated by OTR and not by V1a or V1b <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vasopressin</span></strong> receptors. In addition, [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH produced a more regular contraction pattern than did oxytocin in a preclinical labor induction and augmentation model using myometrial strips from cesarean sections. [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH had no activity in human cardiomyocytes, indicating a potentially improved safety profile and therapeutic window compared to those of clinically used oxytocin. In conclusion, [Se-Se]-oxytocin-OH is a novel probe for validating OTR as a therapeutic target in various biological systems and is a promising new lead for therapeutic development. Our medicinal chemistry approach may also be applicable to other peptidergic signaling systems with similar selectivity issues.</p>

Inhibition of the oncogenic fusion protein EWS-FLI1 causes G<sub>2</sub>-M cell cycle arrest and enhanced vincristine sensitivity in Ewing’s sarcoma
<p>Ewing’s sarcoma (ES) is a rare and highly malignant cancer that grows in the bones or surrounding tissues mostly affecting adolescents and young adults. A chimeric fusion between the RNA binding protein EWS and the ETS family transcription factor FLI1 (EWS-FLI1), which is generated from a chromosomal translocation, is implicated in driving most ES cases by modulation of transcription and alternative splicing. The small-molecule YK-4-279 inhibits EWS-FLI1 function and induces apoptosis in ES cells. We aimed to identify both the underlying mechanism of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> and potential combination therapies that might enhance its antitumor activity. We tested 69 anticancer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s in combination with YK-4-279 and found that vinca alkaloids exhibited synergy with YK-4-279 in five ES cell lines. The combination of YK-4-279 and vincristine reduced tumor burden and increased survival in mice bearing ES xenografts. We determined that independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced events converged to cause this synergistic therapeutic effect. YK-4-279 rapidly induced G<sub>2</sub>-M arrest, increased the abundance of cyclin B1, and decreased EWS-FLI1–mediated generation of microtubule-associated proteins, which rendered cells more susceptible to microtubule depolymerization by vincristine. YK-4-279 reduced the expression of the EWS-FLI1 target gene encoding the ubiquitin ligase UBE2C, which, in part, contributed to the increase in cyclin B1. YK-4-279 also increased the abundance of proapoptotic isoforms of MCL1 and BCL2, presumably through inhibition of alternative splicing by EWS-FLI1, thus promoting cell death in response to vincristine. Thus, a combination of vincristine and YK-4-279 might be therapeutically effective in ES patients.</p>

Intense threat switches dorsal raphe serotonin neurons to a paradoxical operational mode
<p>Survival depends on the selection of behaviors adaptive for the current environment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the sky. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">serotonin</span></strong> has been implicated in adaptive behavior, environmental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that stimulation of dorsal raphe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">serotonin</span></strong> neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat environments but induced escape behavior in high-threat environments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">serotonin</span></strong> neural dynamics inverted in high-threat environments. Stimulation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive environments, and movement-related GABA neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative environments. Thus, dorsal raphe circuits switch between distinct operational modes to promote environment-specific adaptive behaviors.</p>

Heterobiaryl synthesis by contractive C–C coupling via P(V) intermediates
<p>Heterobiaryls composed of pyridine and diazine rings are key components of pharmaceuticals and are often central to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pharmacolog</span></strong>ical function. We present an alternative approach to metal-catalyzed cross-coupling to make heterobiaryls using contractive phosphorus C–C couplings, also termed phosphorus ligand coupling reactions. The process starts by regioselective phosphorus substitution of the C–H bonds para to nitrogen in two successive heterocycles; ligand coupling is then triggered via acidic alcohol solutions to form the heterobiaryl bond. Mechanistic studies imply that ligand coupling is an asynchronous process involving migration of one heterocycle to the ipso position of the other around a central pentacoordinate P(V) atom. The strategy can be applied to complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-like molecules containing multiple reactive sites and polar functional groups, and also enables convergent coupling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> fragments and late-stage heteroarylation of pharmaceuticals.</p>

Changing dynamics of the drug overdose epidemic in the United States from 1979 through 2016
<p>Better understanding of the dynamics of the current U.S. overdose epidemic may aid in the development of more effective prevention and control strategies.

By examining all available data on accidental poisoning deaths back to 1979 and showing that the overall 38-year curve is exponential, we provide evidence that the current wave of opioid overdose deaths (due to prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl) may just be the latest manifestation of a more fundamental longer-term process.

‘Frightening’ typhoid fever outbreak spreads in Pakistan

The so-called extensively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> resistant (XDR) strain of <i>Salmonella typhi</i> remains susceptible to one oral antibiotic, azithromycin, but the only other options are expensive intravenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s that most people in Pakistan and other resource-strapped countries cannot afford. The fear is that if <i>S. typhi</i> develops resistance to azithromycin, many people will die from the disease, which leads to bowl perforation and other life-threatening complications in about 15% of untreated people. A new vaccine that for the first time works in young children and has long-lasting immunity is now being rolled out in Pakistan. But antibiotic resistance and spread are a result of poor sanitation and contaminated water supplies, which reflect the serious infrastructure problems in Hyderabad and Karachi, the two main cities affected by XDR <i>S. typhi. </i>Public health officials worry that the XDR <i>S. typhi</i> will also jump borders and soon start spreading outside of Pakistan.</p>

Nevertheless, the in vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed. CNO does not enter the brain after systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> injections and shows low affinity for DREADDs. Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency.

Deconstructing behavioral neuropharmacology with cellular specificity
<p>Behavior has molecular, cellular, and circuit determinants. However, because many proteins are broadly expressed, their acute manipulation within defined cells has been difficult. Here, we combined the speed and molecular specificity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pharmacolog</span></strong>y with the cell type specificity of genetic tools. DART (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s acutely restricted by tethering) is a technique that rapidly localizes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s to the surface of defined cells, without prior modification of the native target. We first developed an AMPAR antagonist DART, with validation in cultured neuronal assays, in slices of mouse dorsal striatum, and in behaving mice. In parkinsonian animals, motor deficits were causally attributed to AMPARs in indirect spiny projection neurons (iSPNs) and to excess phasic firing of tonically active interneurons (TANs). Together, iSPNs and TANs (i.e., D2 cells) drove akinesia, whereas movement execution deficits reflected the ratio of AMPARs in D2 versus D1 cells. Finally, we designed a muscarinic antagonist DART in one iteration, demonstrating applicability of the method to diverse targets.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology

Small molecules are used commercially as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in screens designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Here, we evaluate whether a novel potent and long-lasting (<i>t</i><sub>½</sub> ≥7 hours) acylated α-CGRP analogue (αAnalogue) could alleviate and reverse cardiovascular disease in 2 distinct murine models of hypertension and heart failure in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ability of the αAnalogue to act selectively via the CGRP pathway was shown in skin by using a CGRP receptor antagonist. The effect of the αAnalogue on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced hypertension was investigated over 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. The ability of the αAnalogue to modulate heart failure was studied in an abdominal aortic constriction model of murine cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure over 5 weeks. Extensive ex vivo analysis was performed via RNA analysis, Western blot, and histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced hypertension was attenuated by cotreatment with the αAnalogue (50 nmol·kg<sup>–1</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>, SC, at a dose selected for lack of long-term hypotensive effects at baseline). The αAnalogue protected against vascular, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, characterized by reduced hypertrophy and biomarkers of fibrosis, remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In a separate study, the αAnalogue reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced hypertension and associated vascular and cardiac damage. The αAnalogue was effective over 5 weeks in a murine model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. It preserved heart function, assessed by echocardiography, while protecting against adverse cardiac remodeling and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the αAnalogue was well tolerated with neither signs of desensitization nor behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings, in 2 distinct models, provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of a stabilized αAnalogue, by mediating (1) antihypertensive effects, (2) attenuating cardiac remodeling, and (3) increasing angiogenesis and cell survival to protect against and limit damage associated with the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This indicates the therapeutic potential of the CGRP pathway and the possibility that this injectable CGRP analogue may be effective in cardiac disease.</p></sec>

Tryptophan-Derived 3-Hydroxyanthranilic Acid Contributes to Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Formation in Mice In Vivo
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abnormal amino acid metabolism is associated with vascular disease. However, the causative link between dysregulated tryptophan metabolism and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. Mice with deficiencies in both apolipoprotein e (Apoe) and IDO (Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup>) were generated by cross-breeding IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice with Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The acute infusion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II markedly increased the incidence of AAA in Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice, but not in Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice, which presented decreased elastic lamina degradation and aortic expansion. These features were not altered by the reconstitution of bone marrow cells from IDO<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II infusion instigated interferon-γ, which induced the expression of IDO and kynureninase and increased 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) levels in the plasma and aortas of Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> mice, but not in IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice. Both IDO and kynureninase controlled the production of 3-HAA in vascular smooth muscle cells. 3-HAA upregulated matrix metallopeptidase 2 via transcription factor nuclear factor-κB. Furthermore, kynureninase knockdown in mice restrained 3-HAA, matrix metallopeptidase 2, and resultant AAA formation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II infusion. Intraperitoneal injections of 3-HAA into Apoe<sup>–/–</sup> and Apoe<sup>–/–</sup>/IDO<sup>–/–</sup> mice for 6 weeks increased the expression and activity of matrix metallopeptidase 2 in aortas without affecting metabolic parameters. Finally, human AAA samples had stronger staining with the antibodies against 3-HAA, IDO, and kynureninase than those in adjacent nonaneurysmal aortic sections of human AAA samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data define a previously undescribed causative role for 3-HAA, which is a product of tryptophan metabolism, in AAA formation. Furthermore, these findings suggest that 3-HAA reduction may be a new target for treating cardiovascular diseases.</p></sec>

Physiology of Angina and Its Alleviation With Nitroglycerin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms governing exercise-induced angina and its alleviation by the most commonly used antianginal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>, nitroglycerin, are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a method by which the effects of antianginal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s could be evaluated invasively during physiological exercise to gain further understanding of the clinical impact of angina and nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty patients (mean age, 65.2±7.6 years) with exertional angina and coronary artery disease underwent cardiac catheterization via radial access and performed incremental exercise using a supine cycle ergometer. As they developed limiting angina, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered to half the patients, and all patients continued to exercise for 2 minutes at the same workload. Throughout exercise, distal coronary pressure and flow velocity and central aortic pressure were recorded with sensor wires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients continued to exercise after nitroglycerin administration with less ST-segment depression (<i>P</i>=0.003) and therefore myocardial ischemia. Significant reductions in afterload (aortic pressure, <i>P</i>=0.030) and myocardial oxygen demand were seen (tension-time index, <i>P</i>=0.024; rate-pressure product, <i>P</i>=0.046), as well as an increase in myocardial oxygen supply (Buckberg index, <i>P</i>=0.017). Exercise reduced peripheral arterial wave reflection (<i>P</i><0.05), which was not further augmented by the administration of nitroglycerin (<i>P</i>=0.648). The observed increases in coronary pressure gradient, stenosis resistance, and flow velocity did not reach statistical significance; however, the diastolic velocity–pressure gradient relation was consistent with a significant increase in relative stenosis severity (k coefficient, <i>P</i><0.0001), in keeping with exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments and dilatation of normal segments, with trends toward reversal with nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The catheterization laboratory protocol provides a model to study myocardial ischemia and the actions of novel and established antianginal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s. Administration of nitroglycerin causes changes in the systemic and coronary circulation that combine to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and to increase supply, thereby attenuating exercise-induced ischemia. Designing antianginal therapies that exploit these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec>

Endothelial Microparticles From Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Induce Premature Coronary Artery Endothelial Cell Aging and Thrombogenicity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Microparticles (MPs) have emerged as a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. This study examined the potential of MPs from senescent endothelial cells (ECs) or from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to promote premature EC aging and thrombogenicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Primary porcine coronary ECs were isolated from the left circumflex coronary artery. MPs were prepared from ECs and venous blood from patients with ACS (n=30) and from healthy volunteers (n=4) by sequential centrifugation. The level of endothelial senescence was assessed as senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity using flow cytometry, oxidative stress using the redox-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, tissue factor activity using an enzymatic Tenase assay, the level of target protein expression by Western blot analysis, platelet aggregation using an aggregometer, and shear stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Senescence, as assessed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, was induced by the passaging of porcine coronary artery ECs from passage P1 to P4, and was associated with a progressive shedding of procoagulant MPs. Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the induction of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. These MPs exhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme activity and upregulated AT1 receptors and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong>-converting enzyme in P1 ECs. Losartan, an AT1 receptor antagonist, and inhibitors of either mitogen-activated protein kinases or phosphoinositide 3-kinase prevented the MP-induced endothelial senescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings indicate that endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients induce premature endothelial senescence under atheroprone low shear stress and thrombogenicity through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiotensin</span></strong> II–induced redox-sensitive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt. They further suggest that targeting endothelial-derived MP shedding and their bioactivity may be a promising therapeutic strategy to limit the development of an endothelial dysfunction post-ACS.</p></sec>

High On-Treatment Platelet Reactivity as a Risk Factor for Secondary Prevention After Coronary Stent Revascularization
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Individualizing antiplatelet therapy after platelet function testing did not improve outcome after coronary stenting in the Assessment by a Double Randomization of a Conventional Antiplatelet Strategy Versus a Monitoring-Guided Strategy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-Eluting Stent Implantation and of Treatment Interruption Versus Continuation One Year After Stenting (ARCTIC) study. Whether results are different during the phase of secondary prevention starting after hospital discharge, when periprocedural events have been excluded, is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>In ARCTIC, 2440 patients were randomized before coronary stenting to a strategy of platelet function monitoring (VerifyNow P2Y<sub>12</sub>/aspirin point-of-care assay) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> adjustment in suboptimal responders to antiplatelet therapy or to a conventional strategy without monitoring and without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> or dose changes. We performed a landmark analysis starting at the time of hospital discharge evaluating the primary end point of death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, or urgent revascularization through 1 year. After discharge, the primary end point occurred in 8.6% of patients in the monitoring arm and 7.9% in the conventional arm (hazard ratio, 1.105; 95% confidence interval, 0.835–1.461; <i>P</i>=0.48). Stent thrombosis or urgent revascularization occurred in 4.4% and 4.5% in the monitoring and conventional arms, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.99). There was no difference for any of the other ischemic end points. Major bleeding event rates were 1.8% in the monitoring arm and 2.8% in the conventional arm (<i>P</i>=0.11), whereas major or minor bleeding event rates were 2.3% and 3.4%, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.10).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Detection of platelet hyper-reactivity by platelet function testing in patients undergoing coronary stenting with further therapeutic adjustment does not reduce ischemic recurrences after intervention. On-treatment platelet hyperreactivity cannot be considered as a risk factor requiring intervention for secondary prevention after percutaneous coronary revascularization.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration—</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

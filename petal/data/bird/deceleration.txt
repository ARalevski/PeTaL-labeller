Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers
<p>Food’s environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s are created by millions of diverse producers. To identify solutions that are effective under this heterogeneity, we consolidated data covering five environmental indicators; 38,700 farms; and 1600 processors, packaging types, and retailers. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s. Most strikingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s of the lowest-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change. Cumulatively, our findings support an approach where producers monitor their own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s, flexibly meet environmental targets by choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s to consumers.</p>

Scalable and safe synthetic organic electroreduction inspired by Li-ion battery chemistry
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive electrosynthesis has faced long-standing challenges in applications to complex organic substrates at scale. Here, we show how decades of research in lithium-ion battery materials, electrolytes, and additives can serve as an inspiration for achieving practically scalable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive electrosynthetic conditions for the Birch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion. Specifically, we demonstrate that using a sacrificial anode material (magnesium or aluminum), combined with a cheap, nontoxic, and water-soluble proton source (dimethylurea), and an overcharge protectant inspired by battery technology [tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoramide] can allow for multigram-scale synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant building blocks. We show how these conditions have a very high level of functional-group tolerance relative to classical electrochemical and chemical dissolving-metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions. Finally, we demonstrate that the same electrochemical conditions can be applied to other dissolving metal–type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive transformations, including McMurry couplings, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive ketone deoxygenations, and epoxide openings.</p>

Quantifying the evolution of individual scientific impact
<p>Despite the frequent use of numerous quantitative indicators to gauge the professional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of a scientist, little is known about how scientific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> emerges and evolves in time. Here, we quantify the changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> and productivity throughout a career in science, finding that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>, as measured by influential publications, is distributed randomly within a scientist’s sequence of publications. This random-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> rule allows us to formulate a stochastic model that uncouples the effects of productivity, individual ability, and luck and unveils the existence of universal patterns governing the emergence of scientific success. The model assigns a unique individual parameter <i>Q</i> to each scientist, which is stable during a career, and it accurately predicts the evolution of a scientist’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>, from the <i>h</i>-index to cumulative citations, and independent recognitions, such as prizes.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Evolutionary Dynamics of Abundant Stop Codon Readthrough
<p>Translational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codon readthrough emerged as a major regulatory mechanism affecting hundreds of genes in animal genomes, based on recent comparative genomics and ribosomal profiling evidence, but its evolutionary properties remain unknown. Here, we leverage comparative genomic evidence across 21 <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes to systematically annotate readthrough genes in the malaria vector <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and to provide the first study of abundant readthrough evolution, by comparison with 20 <i>Drosophila</i> species. Using improved comparative genomics methods for detecting readthrough, we identify evolutionary signatures of conserved, functional readthrough of 353 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codons in the malaria vector, <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, and of 51 additional <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codons, including several cases of double and triple readthrough and of readthrough of two adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codons. We find that most differences between the readthrough repertoires of the two species arose from readthrough gain or loss in existing genes, rather than birth of new genes or gene death; that readthrough-associated RNA structures are sometimes gained or lost while readthrough persists; that readthrough is more likely to be lost at TAA and TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codons; and that readthrough is under continued purifying evolutionary selection in mosquito, based on population genetic evidence. We also determine readthrough-associated gene properties that predate readthrough, and identify differences in the characteristic properties of readthrough genes between clades. We estimate more than 600 functional readthrough <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codons in mosquito and 900 in fruit fly, provide evidence of readthrough control of peroxisomal targeting, and refine the phylogenetic extent of abundant readthrough as following divergence from centipede.</p>

Reductions in Atherogenic Lipids and Major Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A continuous relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) has been observed in statin and ezetimibe outcomes trials down to achieved levels of 54 mg/dL. However, it is uncertain whether this relationship extends to LDL-C levels <50 mg/dL. We assessed the relationship between additional LDL-C, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B100 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions and MACE among patients within the ODYSSEY trials that compared alirocumab with controls (placebo/ezetimibe), mainly as add-on therapy to maximally tolerated statin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data were pooled from 10 double-blind trials (6699 patient-years of follow-up). Randomization was to alirocumab 75/150 mg every 2 weeks or control for 24 to 104 weeks, added to background statin therapy in 8 trials. This analysis included 4974 patients (3182 taking alirocumab, 1174 taking placebo, 618 taking ezetimibe). In a post hoc analysis, the relationship between average on-treatment lipid levels and percent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in lipids from baseline were correlated with MACE (coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) in multivariable analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 33.1% of the pooled cohort achieved average LDL-C <50 mg/dL (44.7%–52.6% allocated to alirocumab, 6.5% allocated to ezetimibe, and 0% allocated to placebo). In total, 104 patients experienced MACE (median time to event, 36 weeks). For every 39 mg/dL lower achieved LDL-C, the risk of MACE appeared to be 24% lower (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.63–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.0025). Percent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in LDL-C from baseline were inversely correlated with MACE rates (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.57–0.89 per additional 50% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion from baseline; <i>P</i>=0.003).

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion among a subgroup at high genetic risk. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high genetic risk had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic risk score derived from up to 57 common DNA sequence variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high genetic risk (top quintile of polygenic risk score) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic risk score and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high genetic risk, statin therapy was associated with a relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22–60; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas in all others, the relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion was 24% (95% CI, 8–37; <i>P</i>=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary prevention, relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in those at high genetic risk was 46% versus 26% in all others (<i>P</i> for heterogeneity=0.05). Across all 3 studies, the absolute risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion with statin therapy was 3.6% (95% CI, 2.0–5.1) among those in the high genetic risk group and 1.3% (95% CI, 0.6–1.9) in all others. Each 1-SD increase in the polygenic risk score was associated with 1.32-fold (95% CI, 1.04–1.68) greater likelihood of having coronary artery calcification and 9.7% higher (95% CI, 2.2–17.8) burden of carotid plaque.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Those at high genetic risk have a greater burden of subclinical atherosclerosis and derive greater relative and absolute benefit from statin therapy to prevent a first coronary heart disease event.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Size-dependent enhancement of water relations during post-fire resprouting
<p>In resprouting species, fire-induced topkill causes a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in height and leaf area without a comparable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in the size of the root system, which should lead to an increase in the efficiency of water transport after fire. However, large plants undergo a greater relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in size, compared with small plants, so we hypothesized that this enhancement in hydraulic efficiency would be greatest among large growth forms. In the ecotone between long-leaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i> Mill.) savannas and wetlands, we measured stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), mid-day leaf water potential (<i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>), leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>), leaf area and height of 10 species covering a range of growth forms in burned and unburned sites. As predicted, <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was higher in post-fire resprouts than in unburned plants, and the post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was positively related to plant size. Specifically, large-statured species tended to undergo the greatest relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in leaf area and height, and correspondingly experienced the greatest increases in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>. The post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was smaller than expected, however, due to a decrease in absolute root hydraulic conductance (i.e., not scaled to leaf area). The higher <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> in burned sites was manifested as an increase in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> rather than an increase in <i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>. Post-fire increases in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> should promote high rates of photosynthesis for recovery of carbohydrate reserves and aboveground biomass, which is particularly important for large-statured species that require more time to recover their pre-fire size.</p>

Ketyl radical reactivity via atom transfer catalysis
<p>Single-electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of a carbonyl to a ketyl enables access to a polarity-reversed platform of reactivity for this cornerstone functional group. However, the synthetic utility of the ketyl radical is hindered by the strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ants necessary for its generation, which also limit its reactivity to net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive mechanisms. We report a strategy for net redox-neutral generation and reaction of ketyl radicals. The in situ conversion of aldehydes to α-acetoxy iodides lowers their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion potential by more than 1 volt, allowing for milder access to the corresponding ketyl radicals and an oxidative termination event. Upon subjecting these iodides to a dimanganese decacarbonyl precatalyst and visible light irradiation, an atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) mechanism affords a broad scope of vinyl iodide products with high <i>Z</i>-selectivity.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing). We show that the frequency stability of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing leads to better stability and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator stability.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy photosynthesis in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy photosynthesis. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale photosynthesis to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy photosynthesis through Chl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion. These simulations demonstrate that canopy photosynthesis should not increase with Chl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy photosynthesis can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions to increase photosynthesis arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

The Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>, decreases nitrogenous excretion, reduces urea synthesis and suppresses ammonia production during emersion
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 6 days of emersion on nitrogen metabolism and excretion in the Chinese soft-shelled turtle, <i>Pelodiscus sinensis</i>. Despite having a soft shell with a cutaneous surface that is known to be water permeable, <i>P. sinensis</i> lost only ~2% of body mass and was able to maintain its hematocrit and plasma osmolality, [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>−</sup>] during 6 days of emersion. During emersion, it ameliorated water loss by reducing urine output, which led to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion (by 29–76%) in ammonia excretion. In comparison, there was a more prominent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion (by 82–99%) in urea excretion during emersion due to a lack of water to flush the buccopharyngeal epithelium, which is known to be the major route of urea excretion. Consequently, emersion resulted in an apparent shift from ureotely to ammonotely in <i>P. sinensis</i>. Although urea concentration increased in several tissues, the excess urea accumulated could only account for 13–22% of the deficit in urea excretion. Hence, it can be concluded that a decrease (~80%) in urea synthesis occurred in <i>P. sinensis</i> during the 6 days of emersion. Indeed, emersion led to significant decreases in the activity of some ornithine–urea cycle enzymes (argininosuccinate synthetase/argininosuccinate lyase and arginase) from the liver of <i>P. sinensis</i>. As a decrease in urea synthesis occurred without the accumulation of ammonia and total free amino acids, it can be deduced that ammonia production through amino acid catabolism was suppressed with a proportional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in proteolysis in <i>P. sinensis</i> during emersion. Indeed, calculated results revealed that there could be a prominent decrease (~88%) in ammonia production in turtles after 6 days of emersion. In summary, despite being ureogenic and ureotelic in water, <i>P. sinensis</i> adopted a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in ammonia production, instead of increased urea synthesis, as the major strategy to ameliorate ammonia toxicity and problems associated with dehydration during terrestrial exposure.</p>

Reconstruction of non-contained acetabular defects with impaction grafting, a reinforcement mesh and a cemented polyethylene acetabular component
<p>This review summarises the technique of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ion   grafting with mesh augmentation for the treatment of uncontained   acetabular defects in revision hip arthroplasty.</p><p>The ideal acetabular revision should restore bone stock, use   a small socket in the near-anatomic position, and provide durable   fixation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ion bone grafting, which has been in use for over   40 years, offers the ability to achieve these goals in uncontained   defects. The precepts of modern, revision <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ion grafting are   that the segmental or cavitary defects must be supported with a   mesh; the contained cavity is filled with vigorously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ed morselised   fresh-frozen allograft; and finally, acrylic cement is used to stabilise   the graft and provide rigid, long-lasting fixation of the revised   acetabular component.</p><p>Favourable results have been published with this technique.

The use of ultra-low-dose CT scans for the evaluation of limb fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate whether an ultra-low-dose CT protocol can diagnose   selected limb fractures as well as conventional CT (C-CT).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We prospectively studied 40 consecutive patients with a limb   fracture in whom a CT scan was indicated. These were scanned using   an ultra-low-dose CT Reduced Effective Dose Using Computed Tomography   In Orthopaedic Injury (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION) protocol. Studies from 16 selected   cases were compared with 16 C-CT scans matched for age, gender and   type of fracture. Studies were assessed for diagnosis and image   quality. Descriptive and reliability statistics were calculated.   The total effective radiation dose for each scanned site was compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean estimated effective dose (ED) for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION protocol   was 0.03 milliSieverts (mSv) and 0.43 mSv (p < 0.005) for C-CT.   The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value   (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION protocol   to detect fractures were 0.98, 0.89, 0.98 and 0.89 respectively   when two occult fractures were excluded. Inter- and intra-observer   reliability for diagnosis using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ION protocol (κ = 0.75, κ =   0.71) were similar to those of C-CT (κ = 0.85, κ = 0.82).

Inflammatory and Cholesterol Risk in the FOURIER Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Patients With Elevated Risk), the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular risk. It is not known whether the efficacy of evolocumab is modified by baseline inflammatory risk. We explored the efficacy of evolocumab stratified by baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). We also assessed the importance of inflammatory and residual cholesterol risk across the range of on-treatment LDL-C concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients (n=27 564) with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL on a statin were randomly assigned to evolocumab versus placebo and followed for a median of 2.2 years (1.8–2.5). The effects of evolocumab on the primary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization, and the key secondary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were compared across strata of baseline hsCRP (<1, 1–3, and >3 mg/dL). Outcomes were also assessed across values for baseline hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C in the entire trial population. Multivariable models adjusted for variables associated with hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 7981 (29%) patients had a baseline hsCRP<1 mg/L, 11 177 (41%) had a hsCRP 1 to 3 mg/L, and 8337 (30%) had a hsCRP >3 mg/L. Median (interquartile range) baseline hsCRP was 1.8 (0.9–3.6) mg/L and levels were not altered by evolocumab (change at 48 weeks of –0.2 mg/dL [–1.0 to 0.4] in both treatment arms). In the placebo arm, patients in higher baseline hsCRP categories experienced significantly higher 3-year Kaplan-Meier rates of the primary and key secondary end points: 12.0%, 13.7%, and 18.1% for the primary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) and 7.4%, 9.1%, and 13.2% for the key secondary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) for categories of <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/dL, respectively. The relative risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions for the primary end point and key secondary end point with evolocumab were consistent across hsCRP strata (<i>P</i>-interactions>0.15 for both). In contrast, the absolute risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions with evolocumab tended to be greater in patients with higher hsCRP: 1.6%, 1.8%, and 2.6% and 0.8%, 2.0%, and 3.0%, respectively, for the primary and key secondary end points across hsCRP strata. In adjusted analyses of the association between LDL-C and hsCRP levels and cardiovascular risk, both LDL-C and hsCRP were independently associated with the primary outcome (<i>P</i><0.0001 for each).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion with evolocumab reduces cardiovascular events across hsCRP strata with greater absolute risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in patients with higher-baseline hsCRP.

NT-proBNP (N-Terminal pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide)-Guided Therapy in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The concept of natriuretic peptide guidance has been extensively studied in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), with only limited success. The effect of NT-proBNP (N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide)-guided therapy in patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess whether NT-proBNP-guided therapy of patients with acute decompensated HF using a relative NT-proBNP target would lead to improved outcomes compared with conventional therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of in-hospital guidance for acute decompensated HF treatment by a predefined NT-proBNP target (>30% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion from admission to discharge) versus conventional treatment. Patients with acute decompensated HF with NT-proBNP levels >1700 ng/L were eligible. After achieving clinical stability, 405 patients were randomized to either NT-proBNP-guided or conventional treatment (1:1). The primary end point was dual: a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions in 180 days and the number of days alive out of the hospital in 180 days. Secondary end points were all-cause mortality within 180 days, HF readmissions within 180 days, and a composite of all-cause mortality and HF readmissions within 90 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Significantly more patients in the NT-proBNP-guided therapy group were discharged with an NT-proBNP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of >30% (80% versus 64%, <i>P</i>=0.001). Nonetheless, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not significantly improve the combined event rate for all-cause mortality and HF readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–1.37; <i>P</i>=0.99) or the median number of days alive outside of the hospital (178 versus 179 days for NT-proBNP versus conventional patients, <i>P</i>=0.39). Guided therapy also did not significantly improve any of the secondary end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The PRIMA II trial (Can NT-ProBNP-Guided Therapy During Hospital Admission for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Reduce Mortality and Readmissions?) demonstrates that the guidance of HF therapy to reach an NT-proBNP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of >30% after clinical stabilization did not improve 6-month outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.trialregister.nl</ext-link>.

Benefit of Adding Ezetimibe to Statin Therapy on Cardiovascular Outcomes and Safety in Patients With Versus Without Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ezetimibe, when added to simvastatin, reduces cardiovascular events after acute coronary syndrome. We explored outcomes stratified by diabetes mellitus (DM).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In IMPROVE-IT (Improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), 18 144 patients after acute coronary syndrome with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 50 to 125 mg/dL were randomized to 40 mg ezetimibe/simvastatin (E/S) or 40 mg placebo/simvastatin. The primary composite end point was cardiovascular death, major coronary events, and stroke. DM was a prespecified subgroup.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 4933 (27%) patients with DM were more often older and female, had had a prior myocardial infarction and revascularization, and presented more frequently with non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome compared with patients without DM (each <i>P</i><0.001). The median admission low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower among patients with DM (89 versus 97 mg/dL, <i>P</i><0.001). E/S achieved a significantly lower median time-weighted average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with placebo/simvastatin, irrespective of DM (DM: 49 versus 67 mg/dL; no DM: 55 versus 71 mg/dL; both <i>P</i><0.001). In patients with DM, E/S reduced the 7-year Kaplan–Meier primary end point event rate by 5.5% absolute (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.94); in patients without DM, the absolute difference was 0.7% (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.04; <i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.02). The largest relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in patients with DM were in myocardial infarction (24%) and ischemic stroke (39%). No differences in safety outcomes by treatment were present regardless of DM. When stratified further by age, patients ≥75 years of age had a 20% relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in the primary end point regardless of DM (<i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.91), whereas patients <75 years of age with DM had greater benefit than those without (<i>P</i><sub>int</sub>=0.011). When stratified by the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Risk Score for Secondary Prevention, all patients with DM demonstrated benefit with E/S regardless of risk.

Postimpact earliest Paleogene warming shown by fish debris oxygen isotopes (El Kef, Tunisia)
<p>Greenhouse warming is a predicted consequence of the Chicxulub <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>, but supporting data are sparse. This shortcoming compromises understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>’s effects, and it has persisted due to an absence of sections that both contain suitable material for traditional carbonate- or organic-based paleothermometry and are complete and expanded enough to resolve changes on short time scales. We address the problem by analyzing the oxygen isotopic composition of fish debris, phosphatic microfossils that are relatively resistant to diagenetic alteration, from the Global Stratotype Section and Point for the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary at El Kef, Tunisia. We report an ~1 per mil decrease in oxygen isotopic values (~5°C warming) beginning at the boundary and spanning ~300 centimeters of section (~100,000 years). The pattern found matches expectations for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>-initiated greenhouse warming.</p>

Protecting marine mammals, turtles, and birds by rebuilding global fisheries
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in global fishing pressure are needed to end overfishing of target species and maximize the value of fisheries. We ask whether such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions would also be sufficient to protect non–target species threatened as bycatch. We compare changes in fishing pressure needed to maximize profits from 4713 target fish stocks—accounting for >75% of global catch—to changes in fishing pressure needed to reverse ongoing declines of 20 marine mammal, sea turtle, and seabird populations threatened as bycatch. We project that maximizing fishery profits would halt or reverse declines of approximately half of these threatened populations. Recovering the other populations would require substantially greater effort <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions or targeting improvements. Improving commercial fishery management could thus yield important collateral benefits for threatened bycatch species globally.</p>

Nitrogen fixation and reduction at boron
<p>Currently, the only compounds known to support fixation and functionalization of dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) under nonmatrix conditions are based on metals. Here we present the observation of N<sub>2</sub> binding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion by a nonmetal, specifically a dicoordinate borylene. Depending on the reaction conditions under which potassium graphite is introduced as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ant, N<sub>2</sub> binding to two borylene units results in either neutral (B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>) or dianionic ([B<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2–</sup>) products that can be interconverted by respective exposure to further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ant or to air.

We show that climate change–induced precipitation changes alone will substantially increase (19 ± 14%) riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental United States by the end of the century for the “business-as-usual” scenario. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s, driven by projected increases in both total and extreme precipitation, will be especially strong for the Northeast and the corn belt of the United States. Offsetting this increase would require a 33 ± 24% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in nitrogen inputs, representing a massive management challenge. Globally, changes in precipitation are especially likely to also exacerbate eutrophication in India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative that water quality management strategies account for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of projected future changes in precipitation on nitrogen loading.</p>

Large benefits to marine fisheries of meeting the 1.5°C global warming target
<p>Translating the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial level into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>-related targets facilitates communication of the benefits of mitigating climate change to policy-makers and stakeholders. Developing ecologically relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>-related targets for marine ecosystem services, such as fisheries, is an important step. Here, we use maximum catch potential and species turnover as climate-risk indicators for fisheries. We project that potential catches will decrease by more than 3 million metric tons per degree Celsius of warming. Species turnover is more than halved when warming is lowered from 3.5° to 1.5°C above the preindustrial level. Regionally, changes in maximum catch potential and species turnover vary across ecosystems, with the biggest risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in the Indo-Pacific and Arctic regions when the Paris Agreement target is achieved.</p>

Translational termination without a stop codon
<p>Ribosomes stall when they encounter the end of messenger RNA (mRNA) without an in-frame <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codon. In bacteria, these “non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong>” complexes can be rescued by alternative ribosome-rescue factor A (ArfA). We used electron cryomicroscopy to determine structures of ArfA bound to the ribosome with 3′-truncated mRNA, at resolutions ranging from 3.0 to 3.4 angstroms. ArfA binds within the ribosomal mRNA channel and substitutes for the absent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codon in the A site by specifically recruiting release factor 2 (RF2), initially in a compact preaccommodated state. A similar conformation of RF2 may occur on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong> codons, suggesting a general mechanism for release-factor–mediated translational termination in which a conformational switch leads to peptide release only when the appropriate signal is present in the A site.</p>

The formation of peak rings in large impact craters
<p>Large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s provide a mechanism for resurfacing planets through mixing near-surface rocks with deeper material. Central peaks are formed from the dynamic uplift of rocks during crater formation. As crater size increases, central peaks transition to peak rings. Without samples, debate surrounds the mechanics of peak-ring formation and their depth of origin. Chicxulub is the only known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> structure on Earth with an unequivocal peak ring, but it is buried and only accessible through drilling. Expedition 364 sampled the Chicxulub peak ring, which we found was formed from uplifted, fractured, shocked, felsic basement rocks. The peak-ring rocks are cross-cut by dikes and shear zones and have an unusually low density and seismic velocity. Large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s therefore generate vertical fluxes and increase porosity in planetary crust.</p>

Dynamic creation and evolution of gradient nanostructure in single-crystal metallic microcubes
<p>We demonstrate the dynamic creation and subsequent static evolution of extreme gradient nanograined structures in initially near–defect-free single-crystal silver microcubes. Extreme nanostructural transformations are imposed by high strain rates, strain gradients, and recrystallization in high-velocity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s of the microcubes against an impenetrable substrate. We synthesized the silver microcubes in a bottom-up seed-growth process and use an advanced laser-induced projectile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> testing apparatus to selectively launch them at supersonic velocities (~400 meters per second). Our study provides new insights into the fundamental deformation mechanisms and the effects of crystal and sample-shape symmetries resulting from high-velocity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s.

BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 Associates with Immune Receptors and Is Required for Immune Responses
<p>Plants utilize cell surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMP/DAMPs) and initiate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Here, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 (BSK5), a member of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily XII, in PRR-initiated immunity. BSK5 localized to the plant cell periphery, interacted in yeast and in planta with multiple receptor-like kinases, including the ELONGATION FACTOR-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and PEP1 RECEPTOR1 (PEPR1) PRRs, and was phosphorylated in vitro by PEPR1 and EFR in the kinase activation loop. Consistent with a role in PTI, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants displayed enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and to the fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Furthermore, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants were impaired in several immune responses induced by the elf18, pep1, and flg22 PAMP/DAMPs, including resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>B. cinerea</i>, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition at the cell wall, and enhanced <i>PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1</i> gene expression. However, <i>bsk5</i> plants were not affected in PAMP/DAMP activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and expression of the <i>FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> or the WRKY domain-containing gene <i>WRKY29</i>. BSK5 variants mutated in the BSK5 myristoylation site, ATP-binding site, and kinase activation loop failed to complement defective PTI phenotypes of <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants, suggesting that localization to the cell periphery, kinase activity, and phosphorylation by PRRs are critical for the function of BSK5 in PTI. These findings demonstrate that BSK5 plays a role in PTI by interacting with multiple immune receptors.</p>

The Mitochondrial Endonuclease M20 Participates in the Down-Regulation of Mitochondrial DNA in Pollen Cells
<p>Maintaining the appropriate number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules is crucial for supporting mitochondrial metabolism and function in both plant and animal cells. For example, a substantial decrease in mtDNA levels occurs as a key part of pollen development. The molecular mechanisms regulating mtDNA copy number are largely unclear, particularly with regard to those that reduce mtDNA levels. Here, we identified and purified a 20-kD endonuclease, M20, from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen mitochondria. We found M20 to be an His-Asn-His/Asn (H-N-H/N) nuclease that degrades linear and circular DNA in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtM20, which shared high sequence similarity with maize M20, localized to the mitochondria, had a similar H-N-H/N structure, and degraded both linear and circular DNA. <i>AtM20</i> transcript levels increased during pollen development, in parallel with a rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in mtDNA. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome-editing techniques were used to generate knockout lines of <i>AtM20</i> (<i>atm20</i>), which exhibited a significant delay in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in mtDNA levels in pollen vegetative cells but normal mtDNA levels in somatic cells. The delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in pollen mtDNA levels was rescued by the transgenic expression of <i>AtM20</i> in <i>atm20</i> plants. This study thus uncovers an endonucleolytic DNase in plant mitochondria and its crucial role in reducing mtDNA levels, pointing to the complex mechanism regulating mtDNA levels in plants.</p>

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool, which enable the interpretation of an observed transcriptomic change (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> for biological processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our perception of the functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the biological significance of the observed DEGs using established biological concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on biological processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA. The PAIR version 5.0-inferred interactome and GSLA Web tool both can be accessed at <ext-link>http://public.synergylab.cn/pair/</ext-link>.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In addition, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP addition in a proteasome-dependent manner. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon addition of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Impaired Malate and Fumarate Accumulation Due to the Mutation of the Tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter Has Little Effects on Stomatal Behavior
<p>Malate is a central metabolite involved in a multiplicity of plant metabolic pathways, being associated with mitochondrial metabolism and playing significant roles in stomatal movements. Vacuolar malate transport has been characterized at the molecular level and is performed by at least one carrier protein and two channels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) vacuoles. The absence of the Arabidopsis tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter (tDT) in the <i>tdt</i> knockout mutant was associated previously with an impaired accumulation of malate and fumarate in leaves. Here, we investigated the consequences of this lower accumulation on stomatal behavior and photosynthetic capacity as well as its putative metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s. Neither the stomatal conductance nor the kinetic responses to dark, light, or high CO<sub>2</sub> were highly affected in <i>tdt</i> plants. In addition, we did not observe any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> on stomatal aperture following incubation with abscisic acid, malate, or citrate. Furthermore, an effect on photosynthetic capacity was not observed in the mutant lines. However, leaf mitochondrial metabolism was affected in the <i>tdt</i> plants. Levels of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were altered, and increases in both light and dark respiration were observed. We conclude that manipulation of the tonoplastic organic acid transporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>ed mitochondrial metabolism, while the overall stomatal and photosynthetic capacity were unaffected.</p>

Global Analysis of Gene Expression in Response to Whole-Chromosome Aneuploidy in Hexaploid Wheat
<p>Aneuploidy, a condition of unbalanced chromosome content, represents a large-effect mutation that bears significant relevance to human health and microbe adaptation. As such, extensive studies of aneuploidy have been conducted in unicellular model organisms and cancer cells. Aneuploidy also frequently is associated with plant polyploidization, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> on gene expression and its relevance to polyploid genome evolution/functional innovation remain largely unknown. Here, we used a panel of diverse types of whole-chromosome aneuploidy of hexaploid wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), all under the common genetic background of cv Chinese Spring, to systemically investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of aneuploidy on genome-, subgenome-, and chromosome-wide gene expression. Compared with prior findings in haploid or diploid aneuploid systems, we unravel additional and novel features of alteration in global gene expression resulting from the two major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong>s of aneuploidy, cis- and trans-regulation, as well as dosage compensation. We show that the expression-altered genes map evenly along each chromosome, with no evidence for coregulating aggregated expression domains. However, chromosomes and subgenomes in hexaploid wheat are unequal in their responses to aneuploidy with respect to the number of genes being dysregulated. Strikingly, homeologous chromosomes do not differ from nonhomologous chromosomes in terms of aneuploidy-induced trans-acting effects, suggesting that the three constituent subgenomes of hexaploid wheat are largely uncoupled at the transcriptional level of gene regulation. Together, our findings shed new insights into the functional interplay between homeologous chromosomes and interactions between subgenomes in hexaploid wheat, which bear implications to further our understanding of allopolyploid genome evolution and efforts in breeding new allopolyploid crops.</p>

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of chloroplast metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ase. In addition, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning chloroplast function is to establish the relationship between these two redox systems and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has antioxidant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ed phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant chloroplast ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the addition of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in chloroplast redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons chloroplasts, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During oxygenic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass spectrometer to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to oxygen, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

Cellulose-Derived Oligomers Act as Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns and Trigger Defense-Like Responses
<p>The plant cell wall, often the site of initial encounters between plants and their microbial pathogens, is composed of a complex mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin polysaccharides as well as proteins. The concept of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) was proposed to describe plant elicitors like oligogalacturonides (OGs), which can be derived by the breakdown of the pectin homogalacturon by pectinases. OGs act via many of the same signaling steps as pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to elicit defenses and provide protection against pathogens. Given both the complexity of the plant cell wall and the fact that many pathogens secrete a wide range of cell wall-degrading enzymes, we reasoned that the breakdown products of other cell wall polymers may be similarly biologically active as elicitors and may help to reinforce the perception of danger by plant cells. Our results indicate that oligomers derived from cellulose are perceived as signal molecules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), triggering a signaling cascade that shares some similarities to responses to well-known elicitors such as chitooligomers and OGs. However, in contrast to other known PAMPs/DAMPs, cellobiose stimulates neither detectable reactive oxygen species production nor callose deposition. Confirming our idea that both PAMPs and DAMPs are likely to cooccur at infection sites, cotreatments of cellobiose with flg22 or chitooligomers led to synergistic increases in gene expression. Thus, the perception of cellulose-derived oligomers may participate in cell wall integrity surveillance and represents an additional layer of signaling following plant cell wall breakdown during cell wall remodeling or pathogen attack.</p>

Effects of Bariatric Surgery in Obese Patients With Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent research efforts on bariatric surgery have focused on metabolic and diabetes mellitus resolution. Randomized trials designed to assess the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">impact</span></strong> of bariatric surgery in patients with obesity and hypertension are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this randomized, single-center, nonblinded trial, we included patients with hypertension (using ≥2 medications at maximum doses or >2 at moderate doses) and a body mass index between 30.0 and 39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Patients were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone. The primary end point was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of ≥30% of the total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining systolic and diastolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg and 90 mm Hg, respectively, at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 100 patients (70% female, mean age 43.8±9.2 years, mean body mass index 36.9±2.7 kg/m2), and 96% completed follow-up. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of ≥30% of the total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining controlled blood pressure occurred in 41 of 49 patients from the gastric bypass group (83.7%) compared with 6 of 47 patients (12.8%) from the control group with a rate ratio of 6.6 (95% confidence interval, 3.1–14.0; <i>P</i><0.001). Remission of hypertension was present in 25 of 49 (51%) and 22 of 48 (45.8%) patients randomized to gastric bypass, considering office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, respectively, whereas no patient submitted to medical therapy was free of antihypertensive drugs at 12 months. A post hoc analysis for the primary end point considering the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) target reached consistent results, with a rate ratio of 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.4–10.6; <i>P</i>=0.005). Eleven patients (22.4%) from the gastric bypass group and none in the control group were able to achieve SPRINT levels without antihypertensives. Waist circumference, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, glycohemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and 10-year Framingham risk score were lower in the gastric bypass than in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Bariatric surgery represents an effective strategy for blood pressure control in a broad population of patients with obesity and hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Modeling Major Adverse Outcomes of Pediatric and Adult Patients With Congenital Heart Disease Undergoing Cardiac Catheterization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Risk standardization for adverse events after congenital cardiac catheterization is needed to equitably compare patient outcomes among different hospitals as a foundation for quality improvement. The goal of this project was to develop a risk-standardization methodology to adjust for patient characteristics when comparing major adverse outcomes in the NCDR’s (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) IMPACT Registry (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between January 2011 and March 2014, 39 725 consecutive patients within IMPACT undergoing cardiac catheterization were identified. Given the heterogeneity of interventional procedures for congenital heart disease, new procedure-type risk categories were derived with empirical data and expert opinion, as were markers of hemodynamic vulnerability. A multivariable hierarchical logistic regression model to identify patient and procedural characteristics predictive of a major adverse event or death after cardiac catheterization was derived in 70% of the cohort and validated in the remaining 30%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rate of major adverse event or death was 7.1% and 7.2% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Six procedure-type risk categories and 6 independent indicators of hemodynamic vulnerability were identified. The final risk adjustment model included procedure-type risk category, number of hemodynamic vulnerability indicators, renal insufficiency, single-ventricle physiology, and coagulation disorder. The model had good discrimination, with a C-statistic of 0.76 and 0.75 in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Model calibration in the validation cohort was excellent, with a slope of 0.97 (standard error, 0.04; <i>P</i> value [for difference from 1] =0.53) and an intercept of 0.007 (standard error, 0.12; <i>P</i> value [for difference from 0] =0.95).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The creation of a validated risk-standardization model for adverse outcomes after congenital cardiac catheterization can support reporting of risk-adjusted outcomes in the IMPACT Registry as a foundation for quality improvement.</p></sec>

Immediate and Midterm Cardiac Remodeling After Surgical Pulmonary Valve Replacement in Adults With Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot provides symptomatic benefit and right ventricular (RV) volume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion. However, data on the rate of ventricular structural and functional adaptation are scarce. We aimed to assess immediate and midterm post-PVR changes and predictors of reverse remoeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Fifty-seven patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (age ≥16 y; mean age, 35.8±10.1 y; 38 male) undergoing PVR were prospectively recruited for cardiovascular magnetic resonance performed before PVR (pPVR), immediately after PVR (median, 6 d), and midterm after PVR (mPVR; median, 3 y).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were immediate and midterm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in indexed RV end-diastolic volumes and RV end-systolic volumes (RVESVi) (indexed RV end-diastolic volume pPVR versus immediately after PVR versus mPVR, 156.1±41.9 versus 104.9±28.4 versus 104.2±34.4 mL/m<sup>2</sup>; RVESVi pPVR versus immediately after PVR versus mPVR, 74.9±26.2 versus 57.4±22.7 versus 50.5±21.7 mL/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.01). Normal po<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stop</span></strong>erative diastolic and systolic RV volumes (the primary end point) achieved in 70% of patients were predicted by a preoperative indexed RV end-diastolic volume ≤158 mL/m<sup>2</sup> and RVESVi ≤82 mL/m<sup>2</sup>. RVESVi showed a progressive decrease from baseline to immediate to midterm follow-up, indicating ongoing intrinsic RV functional improvement after PVR. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved (pPVR versus mPVR, 59.4±7.6% versus 61.9±6.8%; <i>P</i><0.01), and right atrial reverse remodeling occurred (pPVR versus mPVR, 15.2±3.4 versus 13.8±3.6 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.01). Larger preoperative RV outflow tract scar was associated with a smaller improvement in post-PVR RV/left ventricular ejection fraction. RV ejection fraction and peak oxygen uptake predicted mortality (<i>P</i>=0.03) over a median of 9.5 years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant right heart structural reverse remodeling takes place immediately after PVR, followed by a continuing process of further biological remodeling manifested by further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in RVESVi. PVR before RVESVi reaches 82 mL/m<sup>2</sup> confers optimal chances of normalization of RV function.</p></sec>

Early Use of N-acetylcysteine With Nitrate Therapy in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Reduces Myocardial Infarct Size (the NACIAM Trial [N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Contemporary ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction management involves primary percutaneous coronary intervention, with ongoing studies focusing on infarct size <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion using ancillary therapies. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant with reactive oxygen species scavenging properties that also potentiates the effects of nitroglycerin and thus represents a potentially beneficial ancillary therapy in primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The NACIAM trial (N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction) examined the effects of NAC on infarct size in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluated the effects of intravenous high-dose NAC (29 g over 2 days) with background low-dose nitroglycerin (7.2 mg over 2 days) on early cardiac magnetic resonance imaging–assessed infarct size. Secondary end points included cardiac magnetic resonance–determined myocardial salvage and creatine kinase kinetics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 112 randomized patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction, 75 (37 in NAC group, 38 in placebo group) underwent early cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Median duration of ischemia pretreatment was 2.4 hours. With background nitroglycerin infusion administered to all patients, those randomized to NAC exhibited an absolute 5.5% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in cardiac magnetic resonance–assessed infarct size relative to placebo (median, 11.0%; [interquartile range 4.1, 16.3] versus 16.5%; [interquartile range 10.7, 24.2]; <i>P</i>=0.02). Myocardial salvage was approximately doubled in the NAC group (60%; interquartile range, 37–79) compared with placebo (27%; interquartile range, 14–42; <i>P</i><0.01) and median creatine kinase areas under the curve were 22 000 and 38 000 IU·h in the NAC and placebo groups, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>High-dose intravenous NAC administered with low-dose intravenous nitroglycerin is associated with reduced infarct size in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

Effects of PCSK9 Inhibition With Alirocumab on Lipoprotein Metabolism in Healthy Humans
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B100 (apoB). Although studies in mice and cells have identified increased hepatic LDL receptors as the basis for LDL lowering by PCSK9 inhibitors, there have been no human studies characterizing the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on lipoprotein metabolism. In particular, it is not known whether inhibition of PCSK9 has any effects on very low-density lipoprotein or intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) metabolism. Inhibition of PCSK9 also results in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions of plasma lipoprotein (a) levels. The regulation of plasma Lp(a) levels, including the role of LDL receptors in the clearance of Lp(a), is poorly defined, and no mechanistic studies of the Lp(a) lowering by alirocumab in humans have been published to date.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Eighteen (10 F, 8 mol/L) participants completed a placebo-controlled, 2-period study. They received 2 doses of placebo, 2 weeks apart, followed by 5 doses of 150 mg of alirocumab, 2 weeks apart. At the end of each period, fractional clearance rates (FCRs) and production rates (PRs) of apoB and apo(a) were determined. In 10 participants, postprandial triglycerides and apoB48 levels were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Alirocumab reduced ultracentrifugally isolated LDL-C by 55.1%, LDL-apoB by 56.3%, and plasma Lp(a) by 18.7%. The fall in LDL-apoB was caused by an 80.4% increase in LDL-apoB FCR and a 23.9% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion in LDL-apoB PR. The latter was due to a 46.1% increase in IDL-apoB FCR coupled with a 27.2% decrease in conversion of IDL to LDL. The FCR of apo(a) tended to increase (24.6%) without any change in apo(a) PR. Alirocumab had no effects on FCRs or PRs of very low-density lipoproteins-apoB and very low-density lipoproteins triglycerides or on postprandial plasma triglycerides or apoB48 concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Alirocumab decreased LDL-C and LDL-apoB by increasing IDL- and LDL-apoB FCRs and decreasing LDL-apoB PR. These results are consistent with increases in LDL receptors available to clear IDL and LDL from blood during PCSK9 inhibition. The increase in apo(a) FCR during alirocumab treatment suggests that increased LDL receptors may also play a role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of plasma Lp(a).</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Transcatheter Treatment of Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation With the Edge-to-Edge MitraClip Technique
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current surgical and medical treatment options for severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) are limited, and additional interventional approaches are required. In the present observational study, the safety and feasibility of transcatheter repair of chronic severe TR with the MitraClip system were evaluated. In addition, the effects on clinical symptoms were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with heart failure symptoms and severe TR on optimal medical treatment were treated with the MitraClip system. Safety, defined as periprocedural adverse events such as death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac tamponade, and feasibility, defined as successful implantation of 1 or more MitraClip devices and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of TR by at least 1 grade, were evaluated before discharge and after 30 days. In addition, functional outcome, defined as changes in New York Heart Assocation class and 6-minute walking distance, were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 64 consecutive patients (mean age 76.6±10 years) deemed unsuitable for surgery who underwent MitraClip treatment for chronic, severe TR for compassionate use. Functional TR was present in 88%; in addition, 22 patients were also treated with the MitraClip system for mitral regurgitation as a combined procedure. The degree of TR was severe or massive in 88% of patients before the procedure. The MitraClip device was successfully implanted in the tricuspid valve in 97% of the cases. After the procedure, TR was reduced by at least 1 grade in 91% of the patients, thereof 4% that were reduced from massive to severe. In 13% of patients, TR remained severe after the procedure. Significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ions in effective regurgitant orifice area (0.9±0.3cm<sup>2</sup> versus 0.4±0.2cm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.001), vena contracta width (1.1±0.5 cm versus 0.6±0.3 cm; <i>P</i>=0.001), and regurgitant volume (57.2±12.8 mL/beat versus 30.8±6.9 mL/beat; <i>P</i><0.001) were observed. No intraprocedural deaths, cardiac tamponade, emergency surgery, stroke, myocardial infarction, or major vascular complications occurred. Three (5%) in-hospital deaths occurred. New York Heart Association class was significantly improved (<i>P</i><0.001), and 6-minute walking distance increased significantly (165.9±102.5 m versus 193.5±115.9 m; <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Transcatheter treatment of TR with the MitraClip system seems to be safe and feasible in this cohort of preselected patients. Initial efficacy analysis showed encouraging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reduct</span></strong>ion of TR, which may potentially result in improved clinical outcomes.</p></sec>

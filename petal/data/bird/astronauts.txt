NIH quietly shelves gun research program
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) wasn't coy when it responded to a call from then-President Barack Obama for government agencies to do firearm research. The president's plea came on the heels of a gunman's murder of 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December, 2012. Nine months later, the huge biomedical research agency issued three notices encouraging scientists to apply to do research on violence and its prevention, particularly firearm research. NIH has since spent $18 million funding 22 projects. But the agency has now let the gun research program lapse, <i>Science</i> has learned. It stopped taking applications in January, despite a written plea from a score of scientists, and the last new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">award</span></strong>s are now being launched. Last week, an agency spokesperson said that renewal of the program "is still under consideration," but gave no timeline for when the agency would reach a decision.</p>

Closing the loop
<p>In 1963, the term autophagy was coined by Christian de Duve (Nobel Laureate, 1974) to denote the degradation of cellular self-constituents by the lysosome (<i>1</i>). In 2016, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">award</span></strong>ed to Yoshinori Ohsumi for “his discoveries of mechanisms for autophagy” (<i>2</i>). Such discoveries led to the unveiling of autophagy as an evolutionarily conserved pathway that functions in differentiation and development, physiology, and protection against aging and many diseases (<i>3</i>). On page 1036 of this issue, Tsuboyama <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) uncover a surprising twist to the mechanism in mammalian cells for forming the autophagosomal membrane, the structure that engulfs unwanted cellular cargo for delivery to the lysosome. These findings have implications for understanding the various roles of autophagy-related genes (ATGs) in membrane-trafficking and mammalian health and disease.</p>

Tissue Imaging Method Makes Everything Clear
<p>Karl Deisseroth is on a roll. In March, he was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">award</span></strong>ed a share of the world's largest neuroscience prize; last week, he was appointed to advise President Barack Obama's new $100 million brain research initiative. Now, this week in <i>Nature</i>, Deisseroth presents a new way of imaging the brain, which many researchers say will fundamentally change the way labs study the intricate organ. CLARITY, Deisseroth's new technique, can be used to make any organ transparent, but it was the challenges of imaging the brain that motivated Deisseroth, who hopes to dissect psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression.</p>

Early-career researchers: an interview with Heath MacMillan
<p>Heath MacMillan is an Assistant Professor at Carleton University, Canada, where he studies the physiological mechanisms limiting ectotherm performance. He received his Bachelor's degree in biology from the University of Western Ontario, Canada, in 2008 before completing his PhD in 2013 with Brent Sinclair and Jim Staples at the same institution. After undertaking a postdoc with Johannes Overgaard at Aarhus University, Denmark, MacMillan was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">award</span></strong>ed a Banting Fellowship, which he took in the laboratory of Andrew Donini at York University, Canada.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an inbred line of <i>Chenopodium quinoa</i>, an allotetraploid crop with great environmental adaptability and outstanding nutritional properties
<p><i>Chenopodium quinoa</i> Willd. (quinoa) originated from the Andean region of South America, and is a pseudocereal crop of the Amaranthaceae family. Quinoa is emerging as an important crop with the potential to contribute to food security worldwide and is considered to be an optimal food source for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">astronaut</span></strong>s, due to its outstanding nutritional profile and ability to tolerate stressful environments. Furthermore, plant pathologists use quinoa as a representative diagnostic host to identify virus species. However, molecular analysis of quinoa is limited by its genetic heterogeneity due to outcrossing and its genome complexity derived from allotetraploidy. To overcome these obstacles, we established the inbred and standard quinoa accession Kd that enables rigorous molecular analysis, and presented the draft genome sequence of Kd, using an optimized combination of high-throughput next generation sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 and PacBio RS II sequencers. The <i>de novo</i> genome assembly contained 25 k scaffolds consisting of 1 Gbp with N50 length of 86 kbp. Based on these data, we constructed the free-access Quinoa Genome DataBase (QGDB). Thus, these findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying agronomically important traits of quinoa and the effect of allotetraploidy on genome evolution.</p>

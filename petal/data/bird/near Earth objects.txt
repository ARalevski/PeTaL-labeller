Identification of a primordial asteroid family constrains the original planetesimal population
<p>A quarter of known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">asteroid</span></strong>s is associated with more than 100 distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">asteroid</span></strong> families, meaning that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">asteroid</span></strong>s originate as impact fragments from the family parent bodies. The determination of which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">asteroid</span></strong>s of the remaining population are members of undiscovered families, or accreted as planetesimals from the protoplanetary disk, would constrain a critical phase of planetary formation by unveiling the unknown planetesimal size distribution. We discovered a 4-billion-year-old <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">asteroid</span></strong> family extending across the entire inner part of the main belt whose members include most of the dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">asteroid</span></strong>s previously unlinked to families. This allows us to identify some original planetesimals, which are all larger than 35 kilometers, supporting the view of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">asteroid</span></strong>s being born big. Their number matches the known distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">meteorit</span></strong>e parent bodies.</p>

Surface changes on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko suggest a more active past
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft spent ~2 years orbiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong> 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, most of it at distances that allowed surface characterization and monitoring at submeter scales. From December 2014 to June 2016, numerous localized changes were observed, which we attribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong>ary-specific weathering, erosion, and transient events driven by exposure to sunlight and other processes. While the localized changes suggest compositional or physical heterogeneity, their scale has not resulted in substantial alterations to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong>’s landscape. This suggests that most of the major landforms were created early in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong>’s current orbital configuration. They may even date from earlier if the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong> had a larger volatile inventory, particularly of CO or CO<sub>2</sub> ices, or contained amorphous ice, which could have triggered activity at greater distances from the Sun.</p>

Seasonal exposure of carbon dioxide ice on the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is one of the most abundant species in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong>ary nuclei, but because of its high volatility, CO<sub>2</sub> ice is generally only found beneath the surface. We report the infrared spectroscopic identification of a CO<sub>2</sub> ice–rich surface area located in the Anhur region of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong> 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Spectral modeling shows that about 0.1% of the 80- by 60-meter area is CO<sub>2</sub> ice. This exposed ice was observed a short time after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong> exited local winter; following the increased illumination, the CO<sub>2</sub> ice completely disappeared over about 3 weeks. We estimate the mass of the sublimated CO<sub>2</sub> ice and the depth of the eroded surface layer. We interpret the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> ice as the result of the extreme seasonal changes induced by the rotation and orbit of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong>.</p>

The surface composition of asteroid 162173 Ryugu from Hayabusa2 near-infrared spectroscopy
<p>The near-Earth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">asteroid</span></strong> 162173 Ryugu, the target of the Hayabusa2 sample-return mission, is thought to be a primitive carbonaceous object. We report reflectance spectra of Ryugu’s surface acquired with the Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS3) on Hayabusa2, to provide direct measurements of the surface composition and geological context for the returned samples. A weak, narrow absorption feature centered at 2.72 micrometers was detected across the entire observed surface, indicating that hydroxyl (OH)–bearing minerals are ubiquitous there. The intensity of the OH feature and low albedo are similar to thermally and/or shock-metamorphosed carbonaceous chondrite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">meteorit</span></strong>es. There are few variations in the OH-band position, which is consistent with Ryugu being a compositionally homogeneous rubble-pile object generated from impact fragments of an undifferentiated aqueously altered parent body.</p>

Xenon isotopes in 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko show that comets contributed to Earth's atmosphere
<p>The origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong>ary matter and the potential contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong>s to inner-planet atmospheres are long-standing problems. During a series of dedicated low-altitude orbits, the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) on the Rosetta spacecraft analyzed the isotopes of xenon in the coma of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong> 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The xenon isotopic composition shows deficits in heavy xenon isotopes and matches that of a primordial atmospheric component. The present-day Earth atmosphere contains 22 ± 5% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong>ary xenon, in addition to chondritic (or solar) xenon.</p>

Localized aliphatic organic material on the surface of Ceres
<p>Organic compounds occur in some chondritic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">meteorit</span></strong>es, and their signatures on solar system bodies have been sought for decades. Spectral signatures of organics have not been unambiguously identified on the surfaces of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">asteroid</span></strong>s, whereas they have been detected on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong>ary nuclei. Data returned by the Visible and InfraRed Mapping Spectrometer on board the Dawn spacecraft show a clear detection of an organic absorption feature at 3.4 micrometers on dwarf planet Ceres. This signature is characteristic of aliphatic organic matter and is mainly localized on a broad region of ~1000 square kilometers close to the ~50-kilometer Ernutet crater. The combined presence on Ceres of ammonia-bearing hydrated minerals, water ice, carbonates, salts, and organic material indicates a very complex chemical environment, suggesting favorable environments to prebiotic chemistry.</p>

Hayabusa2 arrives at the carbonaceous asteroid 162173 Ryugu—A spinning top–shaped rubble pile
<p>The Hayabusa2 spacecraft arrived at the near-Earth carbonaceous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">asteroid</span></strong> 162173 Ryugu in 2018. We present Hayabusa2 observations of Ryugu’s shape, mass, and geomorphology. Ryugu has an oblate “spinning top” shape, with a prominent circular equatorial ridge. Its bulk density, 1.19 ± 0.02 grams per cubic centimeter, indicates a high-porosity (>50%) interior. Large surface boulders suggest a rubble-pile structure. Surface slope analysis shows Ryugu’s shape may have been produced from having once spun at twice the current rate. Coupled with the observed global material homogeneity, this suggests that Ryugu was reshaped by centrifugally induced deformation during a period of rapid rotation. From these remote-sensing investigations, we identified a suitable sample collection site on the equatorial ridge.</p>

Rosetta’s comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko sheds its dusty mantle to reveal its icy nature
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft has investigated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comet</span></strong> 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from large heliocentric distances to its perihelion passage and beyond. We trace the seasonal and diurnal evolution of the colors of the 67P nucleus, finding changes driven by sublimation and recondensation of water ice. The whole nucleus became relatively bluer near perihelion, as increasing activity removed the surface dust, implying that water ice is widespread underneath the surface. We identified large (1500 square meters) ice-rich patches appearing and then vanishing in about 10 days, indicating small-scale heterogeneities on the nucleus. Thin frosts sublimating in a few minutes are observed close to receding shadows, and rapid variations in color are seen on extended areas close to the terminator. These cyclic processes are widespread and lead to continuously, slightly varying surface properties.</p>

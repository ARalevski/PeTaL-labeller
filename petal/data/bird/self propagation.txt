F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion from actin-mediated transport and measured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth. This model predicts that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

Hindered cytoplasmic diffusion of inositol trisphosphate restricts its cellular range of action
<p>The range of action of intracellular messengers is determined by their rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion and degradation. Previous measurements in oocyte cytoplasmic extracts indicated that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-liberating second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es with a coefficient (~280 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) similar to that in water, corresponding to a range of action of ~25 μm. Consequently, IP<sub>3</sub> is generally considered a “global” cellular messenger. We reexamined this issue by measuring local IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs to monitor IP<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ing from spot photorelease in neuroblastoma cells. Fitting these data by numerical simulations yielded a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient (≤10 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) about 30-fold slower than that previously reported. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of IP<sub>3</sub> in mammalian cells is hindered by binding to immobile, functionally inactive receptors that were diluted in oocyte extracts. The predicted range of action of IP<sub>3</sub> (<5 μm) is thus smaller than the size of typical mammalian cells, indicating that IP<sub>3</sub> should better be considered as a local rather than a global cellular messenger.</p>

Quantitative analysis of competitive cytokine signaling predicts tissue thresholds for the propagation of macrophage activation
<p>Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling regulates macrophage activation and effector cytokine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ation in the constrained environment of a tissue. In macrophage populations, TLR4 stimulates the dose-dependent transcription of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) target genes. However, using single-RNA counting, we found that individual cells exhibited a wide range (three orders of magnitude) of expression of the gene encoding the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α). The TLR4-induced <i>TNFA</i> transcriptional response correlated with the extent of NF-κB signaling in the cells and their size. We compared the rates of TNF-α production and uptake in macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts and generated a mathematical model to explore the heterogeneity in the response of macrophages to TLR4 stimulation and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ation of the TNF-α signal in the tissue. The model predicts that the local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ation of the TLR4-dependent TNF-α response and cellular NF-κB signaling are limited to small distances of a few cell diameters between neighboring tissue-resident macrophages. In our predictive model, TNF-α <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ation was constrained by competitive uptake of TNF-α from the environment, rather than by heterogeneous production of the cytokine. We propose that the highly constrained architecture of tissues enables effective localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ation of inflammatory cues while avoiding out-of-context responses at longer distances.</p>

Genomic and epidemiological monitoring of yellow fever virus transmission potential
<p>The yellow fever virus (YFV) epidemic in Brazil is the largest in decades. The recent discovery of YFV in Brazilian <i>Aedes</i> species mosquitos highlights a need to monitor the risk of reestablishment of urban YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in the Americas. We use a suite of epidemiological, spatial, and genomic approaches to characterize YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. We show that the age and sex distribution of human cases is characteristic of sylvatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Analysis of YFV cases combined with genomes generated locally reveals an early phase of sylvatic YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and spatial expansion toward previously YFV-free areas, followed by a rise in viral spillover to humans in late 2016. Our results establish a framework for monitoring YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in real time that will contribute to a global strategy to eliminate future YFV epidemics.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

Imaging of pure spin-valley diffusion current in WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures
<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials are promising for spintronic and valleytronic applications because valley-polarized excitations can be generated and manipulated with circularly polarized photons and the valley and spin degrees of freedom are locked by strong spin-orbital interactions. In this study we demonstrate efficient generation of a pure and locked spin-valley <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion current in tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>)–tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) heterostructures without any driving electric field. We imaged the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ation of valley current in real time and space by pump-probe spectroscopy. The valley current in the heterostructures can live for more than 20 microseconds and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ate over 20 micrometers; both the lifetime and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion length can be controlled through electrostatic gating.

When early adopters don't adopt

We asked, “What if natural early adopters are not able to adopt early?” This paper is the first to measure the counterfactual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion curve that occurs when NEAs are not allowed to adopt early. The results suggest that NEAs can stifle broader <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of a technology if their usual ability to be first—and to derive value from being first—is compromised.

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Manganese promotes the aggregation and prion-like cell-to-cell exosomal transmission of α-synuclein
<p>The aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn) is considered a key pathophysiological feature of certain neurodegenerative disorders, collectively termed synucleinopathies. Given that a prion-like, cell-to-cell transfer of misfolded αSyn has been recognized in the spreading of αSyn pathology in synucleinopathies, we investigated the biological mechanisms underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ation of the disease with respect to environmental neurotoxic stress. Considering the potential role of the divalent metal manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) in protein aggregation, we characterized its effect on αSyn misfolding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in experimental models of Parkinson’s disease. In cultured dopaminergic neuronal cells stably expressing wild-type human αSyn, misfolded αSyn was secreted through exosomes into the extracellular medium upon Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure. These exosomes were endocytosed through caveolae into primary microglial cells, thereby mounting neuroinflammatory responses. Furthermore, Mn<sup>2+</sup>-elicited exosomes exerted a neurotoxic effect in a human dopaminergic neuronal model (LUHMES cells). Moreover, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis revealed that Mn<sup>2+</sup> accelerated the cell-to-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion of αSyn, resulting in dopaminergic neurotoxicity in a mouse model of Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure. Welders exposed to Mn<sup>2+</sup> had increased misfolded αSyn content in their serum exosomes. Stereotaxically delivering αSyn-containing exosomes, isolated from Mn<sup>2+</sup>-treated αSyn-expressing cells, into the striatum initiated Parkinsonian-like pathological features in mice. Together, these results indicate that Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure promotes αSyn secretion in exosomal vesicles, which subsequently evokes proinflammatory and neurodegenerative responses in both cell culture and animal models.</p>

Social network plasticity decreases disease transmission in a eusocial insect

Pathogen exposure induced behavioral changes in both exposed ants and their nestmates, which helped contain the disease by reinforcing key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion-inhibitory properties of the colony’s contact network. This suggests that social network plasticity in response to pathogens is an effective strategy for mitigating the effects of disease in social groups.</p>

Base <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion potential estimated from city-level incidence data is positively correlated with population size and with spatiotemporal organization in population density, indicating a milder response to climate forcing in metropolises.

Spindle asymmetry drives non-Mendelian chromosome segregation
<p>Genetic elements compete for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion through meiosis, when haploid gametes are created from a diploid parent. Selfish elements can enhance their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion through a process known as meiotic drive. In female meiosis, selfish elements drive by preferentially attaching to the egg side of the spindle. This implies some asymmetry between the two sides of the spindle, but the molecular mechanisms underlying spindle asymmetry are unknown. Here we found that CDC42 signaling from the cell cortex regulated microtubule tyrosination to induce spindle asymmetry and that non-Mendelian segregation depended on this asymmetry. Cortical CDC42 depends on polarization directed by chromosomes, which are positioned near the cortex to allow the asymmetric cell division. Thus, selfish meiotic drivers exploit the asymmetry inherent in female meiosis to bias their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion.</p>

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally transmitted Zika virus has been documented in the United States this year, a reflection of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with efforts to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid spread of the virus through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population immune. This so-called "herd immunity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika virus to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a vaccine against Zika, which caused widespread alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain deformities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the virus while they were pregnant. But with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in the region becoming scarce, it does complicate efforts of clinical trials that hope to show lower rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and disease in vaccinated people.

Anti-coalescence of bosons on a lossy beam splitter
<p>Two-boson interference, a fundamentally quantum effect, has been extensively studied with photons through the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and observed with guided plasmons. Using two freely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) interfering on a lossy beam splitter, we show that the presence of loss enables us to modify the reflection and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion factors of the beam splitter, thus revealing quantum interference paths that do not exist in a lossless configuration. We investigate the two-plasmon interference on beam splitters with different sets of reflection and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion factors. Through coincidence-detection measurements, we observe either coalescence or anti-coalescence of SPPs. The results show that losses can be viewed as a degree of freedom to control quantum processes.</p>

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons transmitted across a ballistic semiconductor junction are expected to undergo refraction, analogous to light rays across an optical boundary. In graphene, the linear dispersion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ation of carriers across an electrostatically defined graphene junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell’s law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative refraction. Resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for realizing electron optics based on graphene p-n junctions.</p>

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-loading pathway has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-loading types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. However, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the structure of PD has not been considered, even though it could impact permeability, and functional data are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, structure, and function using data from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was conducted for all relevant cell–cell interfaces in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-loading types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell interfaces in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-loading type. PD density data of single interfaces, even combined with PD diameter and length data, did not correlate with the intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD substructure not visible on standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results support a proposed passive symplasmic loading mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD structure differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-loading species.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Safety and Efficacy of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning in Patients With Severe Carotid Artery Stenosis Before Carotid Artery Stenting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) can inhibit recurrent ischemic events effectively in patients with acute or chronic cerebral ischemia. However, it is still unclear whether RIPC can impede ischemic injury after carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Subjects with severe carotid artery stenosis were recruited in this randomized controlled study, and assigned to RIPC, sham, and no intervention (control) groups. All subjects received standard medical therapy. Subjects in the RIPC and sham groups underwent RIPC and sham RIPC twice daily, respectively, for 2 weeks before CAS. Plasma neuron-specific enolase and S-100B were used to evaluate safety, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, and new ischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging lesions were used to determine treatment efficacy. The primary outcomes were the presence of ≥1 newly ischemic brain lesions on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging within 48 hours after stenting and clinical events within 6 months after stenting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We randomly assigned 189 subjects in this study (63 subjects in each group). Both RIPC and sham RIPC procedures were well tolerated and completed with high compliance (98.41% and 95.24%, respectively). Neither plasma neuron-specific enolase levels nor S-100B levels changed significantly before and after treatment. No severe adverse event was attributed to RIPC and sham RIPC procedures. The incidence of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging lesions in the RIPC group (15.87%) was significantly lower than in the sham group (36.51%; relative risk, 0.44; 96% confidence interval, 0.20–0.91; <i>P</i><0.01) and the control group (41.27%; relative risk, 0.39; 96% confidence interval, 0.21–0.82; <i>P</i><0.01). The volumes of lesions were smaller in the RIPC group than in the control and sham groups (<i>P</i><0.01 each). Ischemic events that occurred after CAS were 1 transient ischemic attack in the RIPC group, 2 strokes in the control group, and 2 strokes and 1 transient ischemic attack in the sham group, but these results were not significantly different among the 3 groups (<i>P</i>=0.597).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RIPC is safe in patients undergoing CAS, which may be able to decrease ischemic brain injury secondary to CAS. However, the mechanisms and effects of RIPC on clinical outcomes in this cohort of patients need further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Microstructural Impact of Ischemia and Bone Marrow–Derived Cell Therapy Revealed With Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging Tractography of the Heart In Vivo
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The arrangement of myofibers in the heart is highly complex and must be replicated by injected cells to produce functional myocardium.

Mice (n=12) were then injected with bone marrow mononuclear cells 3 weeks after coronary ligation. In half of the mice the donor and recipient strains were identical, and in half the strains were different. A positive response to cell injection was defined by a decrease in mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ivity, an increase in fractional anisotropy, and the appearance of new myofiber tracts with the correct orientation. A positive response to bone marrow mononuclear cell injection was seen in 1 mouse. The response of the majority of mice to bone marrow mononuclear cell injection was neutral (9/12) or negative (2/12).

Cancer mutations and targeted drugs can disrupt dynamic signal encoding by the Ras-Erk pathway
<p>The Ras-Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway encodes information in its dynamics; the duration and frequency of Erk activity can specify distinct cell fates. To enable dynamic encoding, temporal information must be accurately transmitted from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. We used optogenetic profiling to show that both oncogenic B-Raf mutations and B-Raf inhibitors can cause corruption of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion, so that short pulses of input Ras activity are distorted into abnormally long Erk outputs. These changes can reshape downstream transcription and cell fates, resulting in improper decisions to proliferate. These findings illustrate how altered dynamic signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion properties, and not just constitutively increased signaling, can contribute to cell proliferation and perhaps cancer, and how optogenetic profiling can dissect mechanisms of signaling dysfunction in disease.</p>

Fault-tolerant detection of a quantum error
<p>A critical component of any quantum error–correcting scheme is detection of errors by using an ancilla system. However, errors occurring in the ancilla can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ate onto the logical qubit, irreversibly corrupting the encoded information. We demonstrate a fault-tolerant error-detection scheme that suppresses spreading of ancilla errors by a factor of 5, while maintaining the assignment fidelity. The same method is used to prevent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ation of ancilla excitations, increasing the logical qubit dephasing time by an order of magnitude. Our approach is hardware-efficient, as it uses a single multilevel transmon ancilla and a cavity-encoded logical qubit, whose interaction is engineered in situ by using an off-resonant sideband drive. The results demonstrate that hardware-efficient approaches that exploit system-specific error models can yield advances toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

Long-range exciton transport in conjugated polymer nanofibers prepared by seeded growth

These nanofibers exhibit exciton transfer from the core to the lower-energy polythiophene coronas in the end blocks, which occurs in the direction of the interchain π-π stacking with very long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion lengths (>200 nanometers) and a large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient (0.5 square centimeters per second).

The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ed significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.</p>

Mechanically robust, readily repairable polymers via tailored noncovalent cross-linking
<p>Expanding the range of healable materials is an important challenge for sustainable societies. Noncrystalline, high-molecular-weight polymers generally form mechanically robust materials, which, however, are difficult to repair once they are fractured. This is because their polymer chains are heavily entangled and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e too sluggishly to unite fractured surfaces within reasonable time scales. Here we report that low-molecular-weight polymers, when cross-linked by dense hydrogen bonds, yield mechanically robust yet readily repairable materials, despite their extremely slow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion dynamics. A key was to use thiourea, which anomalously forms a zigzag hydrogen-bonded array that does not induce unfavorable crystallization. Another key was to incorporate a structural element for activating the exchange of hydrogen-bonded pairs, which enables the fractured portions to rejoin readily upon compression.</p>

Inactivation of porcine endogenous retrovirus in pigs using CRISPR-Cas9

Using CRISPR-Cas9, we inactivated all of the PERVs in a porcine primary cell line and generated PERV-inactivated pigs via somatic cell nuclear transfer.

DNA replication–coupled histone modification maintains Polycomb gene silencing in plants
<p>Propagation of patterns of gene expression through the cell cycle requires prompt restoration of epigenetic marks after the twofold dilution caused by DNA replication. Here we show that the transcriptional repressive mark H3K27me3 (histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation) is restored in replicating plant cells through DNA replication–coupled modification of histone variant H3.1. Plants evolved a mechanism for efficient K27 trimethylation on H3.1, which is essential for inheritance of the silencing memory from mother to daughter cells. We illustrate how this mechanism establishes H3K27me3-mediated silencing during the developmental transition to flowering. Our study reveals a mechanism responsible for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion of H3K27me3 in plant cells through cell divisions, enabling H3K27me3 to function as an epigenetic mark.</p>

Germ line–inherited H3K27me3 restricts enhancer function during maternal-to-zygotic transition
<p>Gametes carry parental genetic material to the next generation. Stress-induced epigenetic changes in the germ line can be inherited and can have a profound impact on offspring development. However, the molecular mechanisms and consequences of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance are poorly understood. We found that <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes transmit the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 to their offspring. Maternal contribution of the histone methyltransferase Enhancer of zeste, the enzymatic component of Polycomb repressive complex 2, is required for active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ation of H3K27me3 during early embryogenesis. H3K27me3 in the early embryo prevents aberrant accumulation of the active histone mark H3K27ac at regulatory regions and precocious activation of lineage-specific genes at zygotic genome activation. Disruption of the germ line–inherited Polycomb epigenetic memory causes embryonic lethality that cannot be rescued by late zygotic reestablishment of H3K27me3. Thus, maternally inherited H3K27me3, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ated in the early embryo, regulates the activation of enhancers and lineage-specific genes during development.</p>

On the generation of solar spicules and Alfvénic waves

The origin of the spicules is poorly understood, although they are expected to play a role in heating the million-degree corona and are associated with Alfvéííénic waves that help drive the solar wind. We compare magnetohydrodynamic simulations of spicules with observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Spicules are shown to occur when magnetic tension is amplified and transported upward through interactions between ions and neutrals or ambipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion. The tension is impulsively released to drive flows, heat plasma (through ambipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion), and generate Alfvéííéénic waves.</p>

Observation of Anderson localization in disordered nanophotonic structures
<p>Anderson localization is an interference effect crucial to the understanding of waves in disordered media. However, localization is expected to become negligible when the features of the disordered structure are much smaller than the wavelength. Here we experimentally demonstrate the localization of light in a disordered dielectric multilayer with an average layer thickness of 15 nanometers, deep into the subwavelength regime. We observe strong disorder-induced reflections that show that the interplay of localization and evanescence can lead to a substantial decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion, or the opposite feature of enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. This deep-subwavelength Anderson localization exhibits extreme sensitivity: Varying the thickness of a single layer by 2 nanometers changes the reflection appreciably. This sensitivity, approaching the atomic scale, holds the promise of extreme subwavelength sensing.</p>

DNA sequence-dependent epigenetic inheritance of gene silencing and histone H3K9 methylation
<p>Epigenetic inheritance mechanisms play fundamental roles in maintaining cellular memory of gene expression states. In fission yeast, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) is methylated (H3K9me) at heterochromatic domains. These domains can be epigenetically inherited when <i>epe1<sup>+</sup></i>, encoding an enzyme that promotes H3K9 demethylation, is deleted. How native epigenetic states are stably maintained in <i>epe1<sup>+</sup></i> cells remains unknown. Here, we developed a system to examine the role of DNA sequence and genomic context in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ation of a cis-heritable H3K9me-dependent silenced state. We show that in <i>epe1<sup>+</sup></i> cells, in addition to sequence-independent mechanisms that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ate H3K9me, epigenetic inheritance of silencing requires binding sites for sequence-dependent activating transcription factor (ATF)–adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element–binding protein (CREB) family transcription factors within their native chromosomal context. Thus, specific DNA sequences contribute to cis inheritance of H3K9me and silent epigenetic states.</p>

Propagation of Polycomb-repressed chromatin requires sequence-specific recruitment to DNA
<p>Epigenetic inheritance models posit that during Polycomb repression, Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ates histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) independently of DNA sequence. We show that insertion of Polycomb response element (PRE) DNA into the <i>Drosophila</i> genome creates extended domains of H3K27me3-modified nucleosomes in the flanking chromatin and causes repression of a linked reporter gene. After excision of PRE DNA, H3K27me3 nucleosomes become diluted with each round of DNA replication, and reporter gene repression is lost. After excision in replication-stalled cells, H3K27me3 levels stay high and repression persists. H3K27me3-marked nucleosomes therefore provide a memory of repression that is transmitted in a sequence-independent manner to daughter strand DNA during replication. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ation of H3K27 trimethylation to newly incorporated nucleosomes requires sequence-specific targeting of PRC2 to PRE DNA.</p>

Phylogeographic methods have been used to characterize pathogen dispersal at global and regional scales but have yielded few insights into the local spatiotemporal structure of endemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Using geolocated genotype (800 cases) and serotype (17,291 cases) data, we show that in Bangkok, Thailand, 60% of dengue cases living <200 meters apart come from the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion chain, as opposed to 3% of cases separated by 1 to 5 kilometers. At distances <200 meters from a case (encompassing an average of 1300 people in Bangkok), the effective number of chains is 1.7. This number rises by a factor of 7 for each 10-fold increase in the population of the “enclosed” region. This trend is observed regardless of whether population density or area increases, though increases in density over 7000 people per square kilometer do not lead to additional chains. Within Thailand these chains quickly mix, and by the next dengue season viral lineages are no longer highly spatially structured within the country. In contrast, viral flow to neighboring countries is limited. These findings are consistent with local, density-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and implicate densely populated communities as key sources of viral diversity, with home location the focal point of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. These findings have important implications for targeted vector control and active surveillance.</p>

A bacterial global regulator forms a prion
<p>Prions are self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ating protein aggregates that act as protein-based elements of inheritance in fungi. Although prevalent in eukaryotes, prions have not been identified in bacteria. Here we found that a bacterial protein, transcription terminator Rho of <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> (<i>Cb</i>-Rho), could form a prion. We identified a candidate prion-forming domain (cPrD) in <i>Cb</i>-Rho and showed that it conferred amyloidogenicity on <i>Cb</i>-Rho and could functionally replace the PrD of a yeast prion-forming protein. Furthermore, its cPrD enabled <i>Cb</i>-Rho to access alternative conformations in <i>Escherichia coli</i>—a soluble form that terminated transcription efficiently and an aggregated, self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ating prion form that was functionally compromised. The prion form caused genome-wide changes in the transcriptome. Thus, <i>Cb</i>-Rho functions as a protein-based element of inheritance in bacteria, suggesting that the emergence of prions predates the evolutionary split between eukaryotes and bacteria.</p>

Seismic constraints on caldera dynamics from the 2015 Axial Seamount eruption
<p>Seismic observations in volcanically active calderas are challenging. A new cabled observatory atop Axial Seamount on the Juan de Fuca ridge allows unprecedented real-time monitoring of a submarine caldera. Beginning on 24 April 2015, the seismic network captured an eruption that culminated in explosive acoustic signals where lava erupted on the seafloor. Extensive seismic activity preceding the eruption shows that inflation is accommodated by the reactivation of an outward-dipping caldera ring fault, with strong tidal triggering indicating a critically stressed system. The ring fault accommodated deflation during the eruption and provided a pathway for a dike that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ated south and north beneath the caldera’s east wall. Once north of the caldera, the eruption stepped westward, and a dike <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ated along the extensional north rift.</p>

Pathological α-synuclein transmission initiated by binding lymphocyte-activation gene 3
<p>Emerging evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) may be due to cell-to-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion of misfolded preformed fibrils (PFF) of α-synuclein (α-syn). The mechanism by which α-syn PFF spreads from neuron to neuron is not known. Here, we show that LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) binds α-syn PFF with high affinity (dissociation constant = 77 nanomolar), whereas the α-syn monomer exhibited minimal binding. α-Syn-biotin PFF binding to LAG3 initiated α-syn PFF endocytosis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion, and toxicity. Lack of LAG3 substantially delayed α-syn PFF–induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo. The identification of LAG3 as a receptor that binds α-syn PFF provides a target for developing therapeutics designed to slow the progression of PD and related α-synucleinopathies.</p>

Surface uplift and time-dependent seismic hazard due to fluid injection in eastern Texas
<p>Observations that unequivocally link seismicity and wastewater injection are scarce. Here we show that wastewater injection in eastern Texas causes uplift, detectable in radar interferometric data up to >8 kilometers from the wells. Using measurements of uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore pressure. We infer that an increase of >1 megapascal in pore pressure in rocks with low compressibility triggers earthquakes, including the 4.8–moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest earthquake recorded in eastern Texas. Seismic activity increased even while injection rates declined, owing to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of pore pressure from earlier periods with higher injection rates. Induced seismicity potential is suppressed where tight confining formations prevent pore pressure from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ating into crystalline basement rocks.</p>

A SWELL Channel Indeed
<p>Water constitutes about two-thirds of the mass of most living organisms. It serves as a solvent in the cell cytoplasm and exterior, and like other molecules, it moves down its concentration gradient by osmosis. Indeed, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of water is responsible for the dilemma in <i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i>, Samuel Taylor Coleridge's epic poem: “Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink.” If the mariner were to drink seawater, with its high concentration of dissolved salts, the water in his cells would <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e out (down its concentration gradient), dehydrating the cells and killing the seafarer. Two recent studies, by Qiu <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) and by Voss <i>et al.</i> on page 634 in this issue (<i>2</i>), advance our understanding of how animal cells deal with such osmotic challenges.</p>

Rats and Humans Can Optimally Accumulate Evidence for Decision-Making
<sec><title>How to Make Decisions</title><p>Recently, a number of methods to probe internal properties of nonlinear neural systems have been developed. In these methods, highly variable stimuli are used to explore the input space of the system. Neural responses are then studied using models that take advantage of the known trial-by-trial stimulus information. <bold>Brunton <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 95) adapted this combined approach to decision-making. Both in rats and humans, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion constant of the drift-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion model of decision-making was zero, implying that the noise is all in the processing of sensory input and not in the evidence accumulator. In addition, rats gradually accumulated evidence for decision-making, with strong effects of sensory adaptation on gradual accumulation of evidence.</p></sec>

Visualizing Embolism Propagation in Gas-Injected Leaves
<p>Because the xylem in leaves is thought to be at the greatest risk of cavitation, reliable and efficient methods to characterize leaf xylem vulnerability are of interest. We report a method to generate leaf xylem vulnerability curves (VCs) by gas injection. Using optical light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion, we visualized embolism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propag</span></strong>ation in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves injected with positive gas pressure. This resulted in a rapid, stepwise reduction of transmitted light, identical to that observed during leaf dehydration, confirming that the optical method detects gas bubbles and provides insights into the air-seeding hypothesis. In red oak, xylem VCs generated using gas injection were similar to those generated using bench dehydration, but indicated 50% loss of conductivity at lower tension (∼0.4 MPa) in grapevine. In determining VC, this method eliminates the need to ascertain xylem tension, thus avoiding potential errors in water potential estimations. It is also much faster (1 h per VC). However, severing the petiole and applying high-pressure gas could affect air-seeding and the generated VC. We discuss potential artifacts arising from gas injection and recommend comparison of this method with a more standard procedure before it is assumed to be suitable for a given species.</p>

Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic plant that is well adapted to partial flooding. Rice stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the plant gets flooded, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root system upon flooding. AR growth is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged plant tissues due to its lowered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root system in flooded rice plants is controlled not only by altered gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and growth of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of growth direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120° in the dark and downward at 54° in the light. The upward growth direction is conserved in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties, suggestive of a conserved trait in rice. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward growth by about 10°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative phototropism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR system architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile phototropism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the phototropin-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of rice ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward growth) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward growth).</p>

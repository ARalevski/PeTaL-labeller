A Virus-Induced Assay for Functional Dissection and Analysis of Monocot and Dicot Flowering Time Genes
<p>Virus-induced flowering (VIF) uses virus vectors to express <i>Flowering Locus T</i> (<i>FT</i>) to induce flowering in plants. This approach has recently attracted wide interest for its practical applications in accelerating breeding in crops and woody fruit trees. However, the insight into VIF and its potential as a powerful tool for dissecting florigenic proteins remained to be elucidated. Here, we describe the mechanism and further applications of <i>Potato virus X</i> (PVX)-based VIF in the short-day <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> cultivar Maryland Mammoth. Ectopic delivery of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtFT</i> by PVX/AtFT did not induce the expression of the endogenous <i>FT</i> ortholog <i>NtFT4</i>; however, it was sufficient to trigger flowering in Maryland Mammoth plants grown under noninductive long-day conditions. Infected tobacco plants developed no systemic symptoms, and the PVX-based VIF did not cause transgenerational flowering. We showed that the PVX-based VIF is a much more rapid method to examine the impacts of single amino acid mutations on AtFT for floral induction than making individual transgenic Arabidopsis lines for each mutation. We also used the PVX-based VIF to demonstrate that adding a His- or FLAG-tag to the N or C terminus of AtFT could affect its florigenic activity and that this system can be applied to assay the function of <i>FT</i> genes from heterologous species, including tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>SFT</i> and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>Hd3a</i>. Thus, the PVX-based VIF represents a simple and efficient system to identify individual amino acids that are essential for FT-mediated floral induction and to test the ability of mono- and dicotyledonous <i>FT</i> genes and FT fusion proteins to induce flowering.</p>

Replicating Meyerhoff for inclusive excellence in STEM
<p>Ethnic minorities comprise rapidly growing portions of the populations of most developed countries (<i>1</i>) but are underrepresented in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). Efforts to increase diversity in the STEM workforce, important for developing more effective approaches to group problem-solving (<i>4</i>–<i>6</i>), have been under way in the United States for decades, but widespread impact remains relatively low (<i>3</i>). The Meyerhoff Scholars Program (MYS) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), provides a promising model for increasing retention and academic performance of underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates in STEM and for preparing those undergraduates to pursue and succeed in graduate and professional programs (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>). Although MYS is nearly 30 years old and outcomes for African-American STEM majors have been extensively documented [see (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and references therein], no other majority university [not meeting the definition of being a minority-serving institution (MSI) (<i>9</i>)] has achieved similar outcomes (<i>10</i>). We describe here some promising early indicators that an interinstitutional partnership approach can help enable MYS-like outcomes at majority universities with different URM compositions, geographies, and institutional sizes and cultures: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and Pennsylvania State University at University Park (PSU).</p>

Closure of U.S. <i>Toxoplasma</i> lab draws ire
<p>An abrupt decision last week by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to close down its research on a parasite that is the country's second-leading food-borne killer has left scientists who work with <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> bewildered and angry. They say that the $625,000 research program, housed at a USDA lab in Beltsville, Maryland, is a vital resource for scientists in the United States and abroad as they try to understand the parasite's biology, stop its transmission in food and water, and develop a vaccine. But on 2 April, after months of protests from animal welfare activists, USDA declared that the 37-year-old program had "reached its maturity" and "achieved" its goals. The Washington, D.C., advocacy group White Coat Waste Project had protested the lab's killing of dozens of cats each year. It used kittens to collect from their feces a form of the parasite that is needed for research and that is only produced in cats. This year, the group persuaded 61 members of Congress to co-sponsor the Kittens in Traumatic Testing Ends Now Act.</p>

Ancient lowland Maya complexity as revealed by airborne laser scanning of northern Guatemala
<p>Lowland Maya civilization flourished in the tropical region of the Yucatan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peninsula</span></strong> and environs for more than 2500 years (~1000 BCE to 1500 CE). Known for its sophistication in writing, art, architecture, astronomy, and mathematics, Maya civilization still poses questions about the nature of its cities and surrounding populations because of its location in an inaccessible forest. In 2016, an aerial lidar survey across 2144 square kilometers of northern Guatemala mapped natural terrain and archaeological features over several distinct areas. We present results from these data, revealing interconnected urban settlement and landscapes with extensive infrastructural development. Studied through a joint international effort of interdisciplinary teams sharing protocols, this lidar survey compels a reevaluation of Maya demography, agriculture, and political economy and suggests future avenues of field research.</p>

Recent Asian origin of chytrid fungi causing global amphibian declines
<p>Globalized infectious diseases are causing species declines worldwide, but their source often remains elusive. We used whole-genome sequencing to solve the spatiotemporal origins of the most devastating panzootic to date, caused by the fungus <i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>, a proximate driver of global amphibian declines. We traced the source of <i>B. dendrobatidis</i> to the Korean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peninsula</span></strong>, where one lineage, <i>Bd</i>ASIA-1, exhibits the genetic hallmarks of an ancestral population that seeded the panzootic. We date the emergence of this pathogen to the early 20th century, coinciding with the global expansion of commercial trade in amphibians, and we show that intercontinental transmission is ongoing. Our findings point to East Asia as a geographic hotspot for <i>B. dendrobatidis</i> biodiversity and the original source of these lineages that now parasitize amphibians worldwide.</p>

Brain implant trials spur ethical discussions
<p>When a clinical trial of a pharmaceutical fails, participants usually move on by ceasing to take the drug. But it’s not that simple for some people who took part in a trial of a bold, experimental treatment for people with severe depression. The BROADEN trial, which implanted metal electrodes deep in the brain in a region called area 25, failed early on to show a statistically significant effect on depression and was halted after just 90 participants were treated. Yet 44 of those patients want to keep their implants. Last month, researchers at a meeting at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, discussed the ethical issues that such scenarios raise, such as who is responsible for overseeing—and paying for—long-term care when participants want to keep their infants?</p>

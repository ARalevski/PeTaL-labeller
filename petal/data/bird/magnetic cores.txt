Probing magnetism in 2D materials at the nanoscale with single-spin microscopy
<p>The discovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals has generated widespread interest. Making further progress in this area requires quantitative knowledge of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic properties of vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s at the nanoscale. We used scanning single-spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometry based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers to image the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization, localized defects, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic domains of atomically thin crystals of the vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong> chromium(III) iodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>). We determined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization of CrI<sub>3</sub> monolayers to be ≈16 Bohr <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ons per square nanometer, with comparable values in samples with odd numbers of layers; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization vanishes when the number of layers is even. We also found that structural modifications can induce switching between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic and anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic interlayer ordering. These results demonstrate the benefit of using single-spin scanning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometry to study the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ism of 2D vdW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>s.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p>Plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in plastid biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a plastid-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the plastid-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. Plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation provides a rational template to implement plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

Oncogenic RAS isoforms show a hierarchical requirement for the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS2 to mediate cell transformation
<p>About a third of tumors have activating mutations in <i>HRAS</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, or <i>KRAS</i>, genes encoding guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) of the RAS family. In these tumors, wild-type RAS cooperates with mutant RAS to promote downstream effector activation and cell proliferation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation, suggesting that upstream activators of wild-type RAS are important modulators of mutant RAS-driven oncogenesis. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SOS1 mediates KRAS-driven proliferation, but little is understood about the role of SOS2. We found that RAS family members have a hierarchical requirement for the expression and activity of SOS2 to drive cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), SOS2 critically mediated mutant KRAS-driven, but not HRAS-driven, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation. <i>Sos2</i> deletion reduced epidermal growth factor (EGF)–dependent activation of wild-type HRAS and phosphorylation of the kinase AKT in cells expressing mutant RAS isoforms. Assays using pharmacological inhibitors revealed a hierarchical requirement for signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) in promoting RAS-driven cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation that mirrored the requirement for SOS2. KRAS-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation required the GEF activity of SOS2 and was restored in <i>Sos2</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> MEFs by expression of constitutively activated PI3K. Finally, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <i>SOS2</i> reduced EGF-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and synergized with MEK inhibition to revert the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed phenotype of human <i>KRAS</i> mutant pancreatic and lung tumor cells. These results indicate that SOS2-dependent PI3K signaling mediates mutant KRAS-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation, revealing therapeutic targets in KRAS-driven cancers. Our data also reveal the importance of three-dimensional culture systems in investigating the mediators of mutant KRAS.</p>

Saturn’s magnetic field revealed by the Cassini Grand Finale
<p>During 2017, the Cassini fluxgate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometer made in situ measurements of Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field at distances ~2550 ± 1290 kilometers above the 1-bar surface during 22 highly inclined Grand Finale orbits. These observations refine the extreme axisymmetry of Saturn’s internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field and show displacement of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic equator northward from the planet’s physical equator. Persistent small-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic structures, corresponding to high-degree (>3) axisymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic moments, were observed. This suggests secondary shallow dynamo action in the semiconducting region of Saturn’s interior. Some high-degree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic moments could arise from strong high-latitude concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic flux within the planet’s deep dynamo. A strong field-aligned current (FAC) system is located between Saturn and the inner edge of its D-ring, with strength comparable to the high-latitude auroral FACs.</p>

Probing magnetism in 2D van der Waals crystalline insulators via electron tunneling
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulators are a key resource for next-generation spintronic and topological devices. The family of layered metal halides promises varied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic states, including ultrathin insulating multiferroics, spin liquids, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>s, but device-oriented characterization methods are needed to unlock their potential. Here, we report tunneling through the layered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulator CrI<sub>3</sub> as a function of temperature and applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field. We electrically detect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic ground state and interlayer coupling and observe a field-induced meta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic transition. The meta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic transition results in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>oresistances of 95, 300, and 550% for bilayer, trilayer, and tetralayer CrI<sub>3</sub> barriers, respectively. We further measure inelastic tunneling spectra for our junctions, unveiling a rich spectrum consistent with collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic excitations (magnons) in CrI<sub>3</sub>.</p>

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures

Here, we report multiple-spin-filter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic tunnel junctions (sf-MTJs) based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which atomically thin chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) acts as a spin-filter tunnel barrier sandwiched between graphene contacts. We demonstrate tunneling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>oresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures.

All-oxide–based synthetic antiferromagnets exhibiting layer-resolved magnetization reversal
<p>Synthesizing anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>s with correlated oxides has been challenging, owing partly to the markedly degraded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ism of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic layer at nanoscale thicknesses. Here we report on the engineering of an anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic interlayer exchange coupling (AF-IEC) between ultrathin but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic La<sub>2/3</sub>Ca<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> layers across an insulating CaRu<sub>1/2</sub>Ti<sub>1/2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> spacer. The layer-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic switching leads to sharp steplike hysteresis loops with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization plateaus depending on the repetition number of the stacking bilayers. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization configurations can be switched at moderate fields of hundreds of oersted. Moreover, the AF-IEC can also be realized with an alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic layer of La<sub>2/3</sub>Sr<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> that possesses a Curie temperature near room temperature. The findings will add functionalities to devices with correlated-oxide interfaces.</p>

Shear properties of Earth’s inner core constrained by a detection of <i>J</i> waves in global correlation wavefield
<p>Seismic <i>J</i> waves, shear waves that traverse Earth’s inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>, provide direct constraints on the inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>’s solidity and shear properties. However, these waves have been elusive in the direct seismic wavefield because of their small amplitudes. We devised a new method to detect <i>J</i> waves in the earthquake coda correlation wavefield. They manifest through the similarity with other compressional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>-sensitive signals. The inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> is solid, but relatively soft, with shear-wave speeds and shear moduli of 3.42 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 149.0 ± 1.6 gigapascals (GPa) near the inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> boundary and 3.58 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 167.4 ± 1.6 GPa in Earth’s center. The values are 2.5% lower than the widely used Preliminary Earth Reference Model. This provides new constraints on the dynamical interpretation of Earth’s inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>.</p>

Electrical generation and detection of spin waves in a quantum Hall ferromagnet
<p>Spin waves are collective excitations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic systems. An attractive setting for studying long-lived spin-wave physics is the quantum Hall (QH) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>, which forms spontaneously in clean two-dimensional electron systems at low temperature and in a perpendicular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field.

Chemically reversible isomerization of inorganic clusters
<p>Structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ations in molecules and solids have generally been studied in isolation, whereas intermediate systems have eluded characterization. We show that a pair of cadmium sulfide (CdS) cluster isomers provides an advantageous experimental platform to study isomerization in well-defined, atomically precise systems. The clusters coherently interconvert over an ~1–electron volt energy barrier with a 140–milli–electron volt shift in their excitonic energy gaps. There is a diffusionless, displacive reconfiguration of the inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> (solid-solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation) with first order (isomerization-like) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation kinetics. Driven by a distortion of the ligand-binding motifs, the presence of hydroxyl species changes the surface energy via physisorption, which determines “phase” stability in this system. This reaction possesses essential characteristics of both solid-solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ations and molecular isomerizations and bridges these disparate length scales.</p>

Quantized chiral edge conduction on domain walls of a magnetic topological insulator
<p>Electronic ordering in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic and dielectric materials forms domains with different signs of order parameters.

We combine measurements made by the four spacecraft of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ospheric Multiscale mission to demonstrate how the plasma and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic forces at the boundary affect the interaction between the shocked solar wind and Earth’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>osphere.

Multiepitope tissue analysis reveals SPPL3-mediated ADAM10 activation as a key step in the transformation of melanocytes
<p>The evolution of cancer is characterized by the appearance of specific mutations, but these mutations are translated into proteins that must cooperate to induce malignant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation. Using a systemic approach with the multiepitope ligand cartography (MELC) technology, we analyzed protein expression profiles (PEPs) in nevi and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-positive superficial spreading melanomas (SSMs) from patient tissues to identify key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation events. The PEPs in nevi and SSMs differed predominantly in the abundance of specific antigens, but the PEPs of nevi- and melanoma-associated keratinocytes gradually changed during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation process. A stepwise change in PEP with similar properties occurred in keratinocytes cocultured with melanoma cells. Analysis of the individual steps indicated that activation of the metalloproteinase ADAM10 by signal peptide peptidase–like 3 (SPPL3) triggered by mutant BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> was a critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation event. SPPL3-mediated ADAM10 activation involved the translocation of SPPL3 and ADAM10 into Rab4- or Rab27-positive endosomal compartments. This endosomal translocation, and hence ADAM10 activation, was inhibited by the presence of the tumor suppressor PTEN. Our findings suggest that systematic tissue antigen analysis could complement whole-genome approaches to provide more insight into cancer development.</p>

Humans may sense Earth's magnetic field

The experiment recorded brain activity from electrodes on the scalp to search 34 participants for some response to changes in a highly controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field equal in strength to Earth's. It revealed a marked change in brain waves of a certain frequency.

Separation of enantiomers by their enantiospecific interaction with achiral magnetic substrates
<p>It is commonly assumed that recognition and discrimination of chirality, both in nature and in artificial systems, depend solely on spatial effects. However, recent studies have suggested that charge redistribution in chiral molecules manifests an enantiospecific preference in electron spin orientation. We therefore reasoned that the induced spin polarization may affect enantiorecognition through exchange interactions. Here we show experimentally that the interaction of chiral molecules with a perpendicularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ized substrate is enantiospecific. Thus, one enantiomer adsorbs preferentially when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic dipole is pointing up, whereas the other adsorbs faster for the opposite alignment of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization. The interaction is not controlled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field per se, but rather by the electron spin orientations, and opens prospects for a distinct approach to enantiomeric separations.</p>

We found that dispersions and gels of para<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with chiral distortions of the crystal lattices exhibited chiroptical activity in the visible range that was 10 times as strong as that of nonpara<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic nanoparticles of comparable size. Transparency of the nanoparticle gels to circularly polarized light beams in the ultraviolet range was reversibly modulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields. These phenomena were also observed for other nanoscale metal oxides with lattice distortions from imprinted amino acids and other chiral ligands. The large family of chiral ceramic nanostructures and gels can be pivotal for new technologies and knowledge at the nexus of chirality and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ism.</p>

Melting of Iron at Earth’s Inner Core Boundary Based on Fast X-ray Diffraction
<sec><title>Hot Enough to Melt Iron</title><p>Earth's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> is divided into a fluid outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> and a solid inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>, both composed predominately of iron at extremely high pressures and temperatures. The boundary between these two regions is largely controlled by the melting point of iron at ∼330 GPa, which in turn influences heat transfer and geodynamo generation. <bold>Anzellini <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 464, see the Perspective by Fei) compressed iron in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell, tracking its structure and texture by using time-resolved x-ray diffraction as the pressure increased to 200 GPa.

Experimental Observation of the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in a Magnetic Topological Insulator

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis in plants enables the development of high-throughput mutagenesis strategies. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were generated with minimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 targeted genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying targeted genes. Plants with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a collection of lines with targeted mutations and should be applicable to any plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation system.</p>

Disturbed Flow Promotes Arterial Stiffening Through Thrombospondin-1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Arterial stiffness and wall shear stress are powerful determinants of cardiovascular health, and arterial stiffness is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Low and oscillatory wall shear stress, termed disturbed flow (d-flow), promotes atherosclerotic arterial remodeling, but the relationship between d-flow and arterial stiffness is not well understood. The objective of this study was to define the role of d-flow on arterial stiffening and discover the relevant signaling pathways by which d-flow stiffens arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>D-flow was induced in the carotid arteries of young and old mice of both sexes. Arterial stiffness was quantified ex vivo with cylindrical biaxial mechanical testing and in vivo from duplex ultrasound and compared with unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Gene expression and pathway analysis was performed on endothelial cell–enriched RNA and validated by immunohistochemistry. In vitro testing of signaling pathways was performed under oscillatory and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lamin</span></strong>ar wall shear stress conditions. Human arteries from regions of d-flow and stable flow were tested ex vivo to validate critical results from the animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>D-flow induced arterial stiffening through collagen deposition after partial carotid ligation, and the degree of stiffening was similar to that of unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Intimal gene pathway analyses identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing growth factor-β pathways as having a prominent role in this stiffened arterial response, but this was attributable to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) stimulation of profibrotic genes and not changes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing growth factor-β. In vitro and in vivo testing under d-flow conditions identified a possible role for TSP-1 activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing growth factor-β in the upregulation of these genes. TSP-1 knockout animals had significantly less arterial stiffening in response to d-flow than wild-type carotid arteries. Human arteries exposed to d-flow had similar increases TSP-1 and collagen gene expression as seen in our model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TSP-1 has a critical role in shear-mediated arterial stiffening that is mediated in part through TSP-1’s activation of the profibrotic signaling pathways of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ing growth factor-β. Molecular targets in this pathway may lead to novel therapies to limit arterial stiffening and the progression of disease in arteries exposed to d-flow.</p></sec>

Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 Controls Necrotic Core Formation in Atherosclerotic Lesions by Impairing Efferocytosis

Impaired ability of arterial phagocytes to uptake apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) promotes lesion growth and establishment of a necrotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>. The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-5 is an important modulator of myeloid function and programming. We sought to investigate whether IRF5 affects the formation and phenotype of atherosclerotic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the role of IRF5 in atherosclerosis in 2 complementary models. First, atherosclerotic lesion development in hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mice and ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice with a genetic deletion of IRF5 (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>Irf5<sup>-/-</sup>) was compared and then lesion development was assessed in a model of shear stress-modulated vulnerable plaque formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both lesion and necrotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> size were significantly reduced in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>Irf5<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with IRF5-competent ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Necrotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> size was also reduced in the model of shear stress-modulated vulnerable plaque formation. A significant loss of CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages was evident in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>Irf5<sup>-/-</sup> mice in the aorta, draining lymph nodes, and bone marrow cell cultures, indicating that IRF5 maintains CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages in atherosclerosis. Moreover, we revealed that the CD11c gene is a direct target of IRF5 in macrophages. In the absence of IRF5, CD11c<sup>-</sup> macrophages displayed a significant increase in expression of the efferocytosis-regulating integrin-β3 and its ligand milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 protein and enhanced efferocytosis in vitro and in situ.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF5 is detrimental in atherosclerosis by promoting the maintenance of proinflammatory CD11c<sup>+</sup> macrophages within lesions and controlling the expansion of the necrotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> by impairing efferocytosis.</p></sec>

Early Use of N-acetylcysteine With Nitrate Therapy in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Reduces Myocardial Infarct Size (the NACIAM Trial [N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction])
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Contemporary ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction management involves primary percutaneous coronary intervention, with ongoing studies focusing on infarct size reduction using ancillary therapies. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant with reactive oxygen species scavenging properties that also potentiates the effects of nitroglycerin and thus represents a potentially beneficial ancillary therapy in primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The NACIAM trial (N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction) examined the effects of NAC on infarct size in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluated the effects of intravenous high-dose NAC (29 g over 2 days) with background low-dose nitroglycerin (7.2 mg over 2 days) on early cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance imaging–assessed infarct size. Secondary end points included cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance–determined myocardial salvage and creatine kinase kinetics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 112 randomized patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction, 75 (37 in NAC group, 38 in placebo group) underwent early cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance imaging.

High-Sensitive Cardiac Troponin T as an Early Biochemical Signature for Clinical and Subclinical Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although small elevations of high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) are associated with incident heart failure (HF) in the general population, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. Evaluating the association of hs-cTnT with replacement fibrosis and progression of structural heart disease before symptoms is fundamental to understanding the potential of this biomarker in a HF prevention strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We measured hs-cTnT at baseline among 4986 participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), a cohort initially free of overt cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance imaging was performed at baseline. Repeat cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance was performed 10 years later among 2831 participants who remained free of interim CVD events; of these, 1723 received gadolinium-enhanced cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance for characterization of replacement fibrosis by late gadolinium enhancement. Progression of subclinical CVD was defined by 10-year change in left ventricular structure and function. Associations of hs-cTnT with incident HF, CV-related mortality, and coronary heart disease were estimated using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Late gadolinium enhancement for replacement fibrosis was detectable in 6.3% participants without interim CVD events by follow-up cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic resonance. A graded association was observed between higher baseline hs-cTnT categories and late gadolinium enhancement (≥7.42 ng/L versus <limit of detection [<3 ng/L]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.38–5.94). Higher hs-cTnT was also associated with a greater probability of an increase in LV mass >12% (highest category versus <limit of detection; odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–2.07), but not with decline in left ventricular ejection fraction. The risk of incident HF was greater for higher hs-cTnT (≥8.81 ng/L versus <limit of detection; adjusted hazards ratio, 5.59; 95% CI, 2.97–10.68).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>hs-cTnT levels are associated with replacement fibrosis and progressive changes in left ventricular structure in CVD-free adults, findings that may precede HF symptoms by years. Minor elevations of hs-cTnT may represent a biochemical signature of early subclinical cardiac disease, providing an opportunity for targeted preventive interventions.</p></sec>

Evidence for Majorana bound states in an iron-based superconductor
<p>The search for Majorana bound states (MBSs) has been fueled by the prospect of using their non-Abelian statistics for robust quantum computation. Two-dimensional superconducting topological materials have been predicted to host MBSs as zero-energy modes in vortex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>s. By using scanning tunneling spectroscopy on the superconducting Dirac surface state of the iron-based superconductor FeTe<sub>0.55</sub>Se<sub>0.45</sub>, we observed a sharp zero-bias peak inside a vortex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> that does not split when moving away from the vortex center. The evolution of the peak under varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field, temperature, and tunneling barrier is consistent with the tunneling to a nearly pure MBS, separated from nontopological bound states. This observation offers a potential platform for realizing and manipulating MBSs at a relatively high temperature.</p>

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor

Two areas for familiar face recognition in the primate brain

Familiar faces also recruited two hitherto unknown face areas at anatomically conserved locations within the perirhinal cortex and the temporal pole. These two areas, but not the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> face-processing network, responded to familiar faces emerging from a blur with a characteristic nonlinear surge, akin to the abruptness of familiar face recognition.

Similar diluted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of spin-charge separation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of nonlocal spin-density correlation functions reveals a hidden finite-range anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic order, a direct consequence of spin-charge separation. Our technique, which measures nonlocal order directly, can be readily extended to higher dimensions to study the complex interplay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic order and density fluctuations.</p>

Reconfiguration of DNA molecular arrays driven by information relay
<p>Information relay at the molecular level is an essential phenomenon in numerous chemical and biological processes, such as intricate signaling cascades. One key challenge in synthetic molecular self-assembly is to construct artificial structures that imitate these complex behaviors in controllable systems. We demonstrated prescribed, long-range information relay in an artificial molecular array assembled from modular DNA structural units. The dynamic DNA molecular array exhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ations with programmable initiation, propagation, and regulation. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation of the array can be initiated at selected units and then propagated, without addition of extra triggers, to neighboring units and eventually the entire array. The specific information pathways by which this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation occurs can be controlled by altering the design of individual units and the arrays.</p>

Chiral Majorana fermion modes in a quantum anomalous Hall insulator–superconductor structure
<p>Majorana fermion is a hypothetical particle that is its own antiparticle. We report transport measurements that suggest the existence of one-dimensional chiral Majorana fermion modes in the hybrid system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film coupled with a superconductor. As the external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field is swept, half-integer quantized conductance plateaus are observed at the locations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ization reversals, giving a distinct signature of the Majorana fermion modes. This transport signature is reproducible over many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field sweeps and appears at different temperatures. This finding may open up an avenue to control Majorana fermions for implementing robust topological quantum computing.</p>

Control and local measurement of the spin chemical potential in a magnetic insulator
<p>The spin chemical potential characterizes the tendency of spins to diffuse. Probing this quantity could provide insight into materials such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulators and spin liquids and aid optimization of spintronic devices. Here we introduce single-spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ometry as a generic platform for nonperturbative, nanoscale characterization of spin chemical potentials. We experimentally realize this platform using diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers and use it to investigate magnons in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic insulator, finding that the magnon chemical potential can be controlled by driving the system’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong></span></strong>ic resonance. We introduce a symmetry-based two-fluid theory describing the underlying magnon processes, measure the local thermomagnonic torque, and illustrate the detection sensitivity using electrically controlled spin injection. Our results pave the way for nanoscale control and imaging of spin transport in mesoscopic systems.</p>

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic fields of solar-type stars are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the turbulent convective layers of stars and have a complex dependency upon stellar rotation rate. We have performed a set of turbulent global simulations that exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic cycles varying systematically with stellar rotation and luminosity. We find that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of rotation on turbulent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type stars.</p>

Quantitative 3D evolution of colloidal nanoparticle oxidation in solution
<p>Real-time tracking of the three-dimensional (3D) evolution of colloidal nanoparticles in solution is essential for understanding complex mechanisms involved in nanoparticle growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation. We used time-resolved small-angle and wide-angle x-ray scattering simultaneously to monitor oxidation of highly uniform colloidal iron nanoparticles, enabling the reconstruction of intermediate 3D morphologies of the nanoparticles with a spatial resolution of <i>~</i>5 angstroms. The in situ observations, combined with large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations, reveal the details of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation from solid metal nanoparticles to hollow metal oxide nanoshells via a nanoscale Kirkendall process—for example, coalescence of voids as they grow and reversal of mass diffusion direction depending on crystallinity. Our results highlight the complex interplay between defect chemistry and defect dynamics in determining nanoparticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ation and formation.</p>

Direct observation of individual hydrogen atoms at trapping sites in a ferritic steel
<p>The design of atomic-scale microstructural traps to limit the diffusion of hydrogen is one key strategy in the development of hydrogen-embrittlement–resistant materials. In the case of bearing steels, an effective trapping mechanism may be the incorporation of finely dispersed V-Mo-Nb carbides in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferrit</span></strong>e matrix. First, we charged a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferrit</span></strong>ic steel with deuterium by means of electrolytic loading to achieve a high hydrogen concentration. We then immobilized it in the microstructure with a cryogenic transfer protocol before atom probe tomography (APT) analysis. Using APT, we show trapping of hydrogen within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> of these carbides with quantitative composition profiles. Furthermore, with this method the experiment can be feasibly replicated in any APT-equipped laboratory by using a simple cold chain.</p>

Lifetime of the solar nebula constrained by meteorite paleomagnetism
<p>A key stage in planet formation is the evolution of a gaseous and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ized solar nebula. However, the lifetime of the nebular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field and nebula are poorly constrained. We present paleo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic analyses of volcanic angrites demonstrating that they formed in a near-zero <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">magnet</span></strong>ic field (<0.6 microtesla) at 4563.5 ± 0.1 million years ago, ~3.8 million years after solar system formation. This indicates that the solar nebula field, and likely the nebular gas, had dispersed by this time. This sets the time scale for formation of the gas giants and planet migration. Furthermore, it supports formation of chondrules after 4563.5 million years ago by non-nebular processes like planetesimal collisions. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> dynamo on the angrite parent body did not initiate until about 4 to 11 million years after solar system formation.</p>

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions
<p>HIV-1 contains a cone-shaped capsid encasing the viral genome. This capsid is thought to follow fullerene geometry—a curved hexameric lattice of the capsid protein, CA, closed by incorporating 12 CA pentamers. Current models for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> structure are based on crystallography of hexameric and cross-linked pentameric CA, electron microscopy of tubular CA arrays, and simulations. Here, we report subnanometer-resolution cryo–electron tomography structures of hexameric and pentameric CA within intact HIV-1 particles. Whereas the hexamer structure is compatible with crystallography studies, the pentamer forms using different interfaces. Determining multiple structures revealed how CA flexes to form the variably curved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> shell. We show that HIV-1 CA assembles both aberrant and perfect fullerene cones, supporting models in which conical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>s assemble de novo after maturation.</p>

Biaxially strained PtPb/Pt core/shell nanoplate boosts oxygen reduction catalysis
<p>Compressive surface strains have been necessary to boost oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>/shell M/platinum (Pt) catalysts (where M can be nickel, cobalt, or iron). We report on a class of platinum-lead/platinum (PtPb/Pt) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>/shell nanoplate catalysts that exhibit large biaxial strains. The stable Pt (110) facets of the nanoplates have high ORR specific and mass activities that reach 7.8 milliampere (mA) per centimeter squared and 4.3 ampere per milligram of platinum at 0.9 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the edge-Pt and top (bottom)–Pt (110) facets undergo large tensile strains that help optimize the Pt-O bond strength. The intermetallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> and uniform four layers of Pt shell of the PtPb/Pt nanoplates appear to underlie the high endurance of these catalysts, which can undergo 50,000 voltage cycles with negligible activity decay and no apparent structure and composition changes.</p>

Dynamic Changes between Two LHCX-Related Energy Quenching Sites Control Diatom Photoacclimation
<p>Marine diatoms are prominent phytoplankton organisms that perform photosynthesis in extremely variable environments. Diatoms possess a strong ability to dissipate excess absorbed energy as heat via nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). This process relies on changes in carotenoid pigment composition (xanthophyll cycle) and on specific members of the light-harvesting complex family specialized in photoprotection (LHCXs), which potentially act as NPQ effectors. However, the link between light stress, NPQ, and the existence of different LHCX isoforms is not understood in these organisms. Using picosecond fluorescence analysis, we observed two types of NPQ in the pennate diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> that were dependent on light conditions. Short exposure of low-light-acclimated cells to high light triggers the onset of energy quenching close to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> of photosystem II, while prolonged light stress activates NPQ in the antenna. Biochemical analysis indicated a link between the changes in the NPQ site/mechanism and the induction of different LHCX isoforms, which accumulate either in the antenna complexes or in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> complex. By comparing the responses of wild-type cells and transgenic lines with a reduced expression of the major LHCX isoform, LHCX1, we conclude that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> complex-associated NPQ is more effective in photoprotection than is the antenna complex. Overall, our data clarify the complex molecular scenario of light responses in diatoms and provide a rationale for the existence of a degenerate family of LHCX proteins in these algae.</p>

Oxidation of Translation Factor EF-Tu Inhibits the Repair of Photosystem II<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The repair of photosystem II (PSII) is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress and the inhibition of repair is associated with oxidative damage to the translational elongation system in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibition are unknown. We previously demonstrated in vitro that EF-Tu, a translation factor that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome, is inactivated by reactive oxygen species via oxidation of the Cys residue Cys-82. In this study, we examined the physiological role of the oxidation of EF-Tu in <i>Synechocystis</i>. Under strong light, EF-Tu was rapidly oxidized to yield oxidized monomers in vivo. We generated a <i>Synechocystis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ant that expressed mutated EF-Tu in which Cys-82 had been replaced with a Ser residue. Under strong light, the de novo synthesis of proteins that are required for PSII repair, such as D1, was enhanced in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ant and photoinhibition of PSII was alleviated. However, photodamage to PSII, measured in the presence of lincomycin, was similar between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ant and wild-type cells, suggesting that expression of mutated EF-Tu might enhance the repair of PSII. Alleviating photoinhibition through mutation of EF-Tu did not alter cell growth under strong light, perhaps due to the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species. These observations suggest that the oxidation of EF-Tu under strong light inhibits PSII repair, resulting in the stimulation of photoinhibition.</p>

The MtDMI2-MtPUB2 Negative Feedback Loop Plays a Role in Nodulation Homeostasis
<p>DOES NOT MAKE INFECTION 2 (MtDMI2) is a Leu rich repeat-type receptor kinase required for signal transduction in the <i>Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> symbiosis pathway. However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in nodulation homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel plant U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulation were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of plants in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi plants) exhibited impaired infection threads, fewer nodules, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer nodules than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitination activity, and their nodulation phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transform</span></strong>ed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative feedback loop of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative feedback loop, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulation of nodulation via MtNIN, plays an important role in nodulation homeostasis.</p>

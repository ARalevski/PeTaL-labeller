Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> balance, experiencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption, allowing excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption, both species showed linear increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> flux and fractional body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> turnover as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption was not sufficient to completely offset dietary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> reabsorption (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption as an important component of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> regulation to help deal with massive preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> load by varying both intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> absorption and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

Association of Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Survival According to Ambulance Response Times After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bystander-initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) increases patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but it is unknown to what degree bystander CPR remains positively associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al with increasing time to potential defibrillation. The main objective was to examine the association of bystander CPR with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al as time to advanced treatment increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 7623 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients between 2005 and 2011, identified through the nationwide Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between time from 911 call to emergency medical service arrival (response time) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al according to whether bystander CPR was provided (yes or no). Reported are 30-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al chances with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>With increasing response times, adjusted 30-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al chances decreased for both patients with bystander CPR and those without. However, the contrast between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al chances of patients with versus without bystander CPR increased over time: within 5 minutes, 30-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al was 14.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.8–16.4) versus 6.3% (95% CI: 5.1–7.6), corresponding to 2.3 times higher chances of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al associated with bystander CPR; within 10 minutes, 30-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al chances were 6.7% (95% CI: 5.4–8.1) versus 2.2% (95% CI: 1.5–3.1), corresponding to 3.0 times higher chances of 30-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al associated with bystander CPR. The contrast in 30-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al became statistically insignificant when response time was >13 minutes (bystander CPR vs no bystander CPR: 3.7% [95% CI: 2.2–5.4] vs 1.5% [95% CI: 0.6–2.7]), but 30-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al was still 2.5 times higher associated with bystander CPR. Based on the model and Danish out-of-hospital cardiac arrest statistics, an additional 233 patients could potentially be saved annually if response time was reduced from 10 to 5 minutes and 119 patients if response time was reduced from 7 (the median response time in this study) to 5 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al associated with bystander CPR declined rapidly with time. Yet bystander CPR while waiting for an ambulance was associated with a more than doubling of 30-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al even in case of long ambulance response time. Decreasing ambulance response time by even a few minutes could potentially lead to many additional lives saved every year.</p></sec>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p>Plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency (WUE) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sustain</span></strong> growth in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance agricultural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sustain</span></strong>ability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of plant size and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use are correlated strongly in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of plant size given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing plant size, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of plant WUE under different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>ing treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response as well as in supporting the generation of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues play an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response of plants to light stress.</p>

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density versus cells with high t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD unloading. An intact t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> at the time of LVAD implantation may constitute a precondition and predictor for functional cardiac recovery after mechanical unloading.</p></sec>

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> discharge from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of vessel cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under drought stress, and potentially refill after soil saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels releases stored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive drought stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-filled even under severe drought stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> release from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> release from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stored in the xylem matrix is released after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> contributes to overall stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage under drought but is not used primarily for the prevention of drought-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

Of 68   local recurrences, 60 (88%) were identified by the patients themselves.   The six-monthly regime (overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al (OS) 54%, recurrence-free   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al (RFS) 46%) did not lead to a worse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al and was not   inferior to the three-monthly regime (OS 55%, RFS 47%) in terms   of detecting recurrence.

Enhanced Therapeutic and Long-Term Dynamic Vascularization Effects of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Endothelial Cells Encapsulated in a Nanomatrix Gel
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)–derived endothelial cells (ECs) have limited clinical utility because of undefined components in the differentiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and poor cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al in vivo. Here, we aimed to develop a fully defined and clinically compatible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to differentiate hPSCs into ECs. Furthermore, we aimed to enhance cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al, vessel formation, and therapeutic potential by encapsulating hPSC-ECs with a peptide amphiphile (PA) nanomatrix gel.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We induced differentiation of hPSCs into the mesodermal lineage by culturing on collagen-coated plates with a glycogen synthase kinase 3β inhibitor. Next, vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor were added for endothelial lineage differentiation, followed by sorting for CDH5 (VE-cadherin). We constructed an extracellular matrix–mimicking PA nanomatrix gel (PA-RGDS) by incorporating the cell adhesive ligand Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) and a matrix metalloproteinase-2–degradable sequence. We then evaluated whether the encapsulation of hPSC-CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells in PA-RGDS could enhance long-term cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al and vascular regenerative effects in a hind-limb ischemia model with laser Doppler perfusion imaging, bioluminescence imaging, real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction, and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The resultant hPSC-derived CDH5<sup>+</sup> cells (hPSC-ECs) showed highly enriched and genuine EC characteristics and proangiogenic activities. When injected into ischemic hind limbs, hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery and higher vessel-forming capacity compared with media-, PA-RGDS–, or human umbilical vein EC–injected groups. However, the group receiving the PA-RGDS–encapsulated hPSC-ECs showed better perfusion recovery, more robust and longer cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al (> 10 months), and higher and prolonged angiogenic and vascular incorporation capabilities than the bare hPSC-EC–injected group. Surprisingly, the engrafted hPSC-ECs demonstrated previously unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sustain</span></strong>ed and dynamic vessel-forming behavior: initial perivascular concentration, a guiding role for new vessel formation, and progressive incorporation into the vessels over 10 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We generated highly enriched hPSC-ECs via a clinically compatible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>.

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations to summer soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status, e.g., by access to alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining soil moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage can be derived from rehydration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage capacitance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> storage. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that storage compartments for capillary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain storage compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> uptake, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> uptake. Under low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> availability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> acquisition by reallocating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

Association Between Prompt Defibrillation and Epinephrine Treatment With Long-Term Survival After In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prior studies have reported higher in-hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al with prompt defibrillation and epinephrine treatment in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Whether this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al benefit persists after discharge is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We linked data from a national IHCA registry with Medicare files and identified 36 961 patients ≥65 years of age with an IHCA at 517 hospitals between 2000 and 2011. Patients with IHCA caused by pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were stratified by prompt (≤2 minutes) versus delayed (>2 minutes) defibrillation, whereas patients with IHCA caused by asystole or pulseless electric activity were stratified by prompt (≤5 minutes) versus delayed (>5 minutes) epinephrine treatment. The association between prompt treatment and long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al for each rhythm type was assessed with multivariable hierarchical modified Poisson regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 8119 patients with an IHCA caused by ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, the rate of 1-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al was higher in those treated with prompt defibrillation than with delayed defibrillation (25.7% [1466 of 5714] versus 15.5% [373 of 2405]; adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32–1.69; <i>P</i><0.0001). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al advantage persisted at 3 years (19.1% versus 11.0%; adjusted RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.23–1.69; <i>P</i><0.0001) and at 5 years (14.7% versus 7.9%; adjusted RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.22–1.83; <i>P</i><0.0001). Of 28 842 patients with an IHCA caused by asystole/pulseless electric activity, the rate of 1-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al with prompt epinephrine treatment was higher than with delayed treatment (5.4% [1341 of 24 885] versus 4.3% [168 of 3957]; adjusted RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02–1.41; <i>P</i>=0.02), but this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al benefit was no longer present at 3 years (3.5% versus 2.9%; adjusted RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.95–1.45; <i>P</i>=0.15) and at 5 years (2.3% versus 1.9%; adjusted RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.88–1.58; <i>P</i>=0.27).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Prompt defibrillation for IHCA caused by ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was associated with higher rates of long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al throughout 5 years of follow-up, whereas prompt epinephrine treatment for asystole/pulseless electric activity was associated with greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al at 1 year but not at 3 or 5 years. By quantifying the greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al associated with timely defibrillation and epinephrine administration, these findings provide important insights into the durability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al benefits for 2 process-of-care measures in current resuscitation guidelines.</p></sec>

Hospital Variation in Time to Epinephrine for Nonshockable In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>For patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests attributable to nonshockable rhythms, delays in epinephrine administration beyond 5 minutes is associated with worse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al. However, the extent of hospital variation in delayed epinephrine administration and its effect on hospital-level outcomes is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Within Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation, we identified 103 932 adult patients (≥18 years) at 548 hospitals with an in-hospital cardiac arrest attributable to a nonshockable rhythm who received at least 1 dose of epinephrine between 2000 and 2014. We constructed 2-level hierarchical regression models to quantify hospital variation in rates of delayed epinephrine administration (>5 minutes) and its association with hospital rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al to discharge and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al with functional recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 13 213 (12.7%) patients had delays to epinephrine, and this rate varied markedly across hospitals (range, 0%–53.8%). The odds of delay in epinephrine administration were 58% higher at 1 randomly selected hospital in comparison with a similar patient at another randomly selected hospital (median odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.51–1.64). The median risk-standardized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al rate was 12.0% (range, 5.4%–31.9%), and the risk-standardized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al with functional recovery was 7.4% (range, 0.9%–30.8%).

In comparison with a median <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al rate of 12.9% (interquartile range, 11.1%–15.4%) at hospitals in the lowest quartile of epinephrine delay, risk-standardized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al was 16% lower at hospitals in the quartile with the highest rate of epinephrine delays (10.8%; interquartile range, 9.7%–12.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Delays in epinephrine administration following in-hospital cardiac arrest are common and variy across hospitals. Hospitals with high rates of delayed epinephrine administration had lower rates of overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al for in-hospital cardiac arrest attributable to nonshockable rhythm. Further studies are needed to determine whether improving hospital performance on time to epinephrine administration, especially at hospitals with poor performance on this metric, will lead to improved outcomes.</p></sec>

Organ-coordinated response of early post-germination mahogany seedlings to drought
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit tolerance during post-germination stages is critical for seedling recruitment. In this work, we studied the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit on morphological and biochemical responses in different organs of newly germinated mahogany (<i>Swietenia macrophylla</i> King) seedlings, a woody species that occurs in the Amazon rainforest. The root : shoot ratio increased under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit. The leaf number and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential were not altered, although reductions in leaf area and stomatal conductance were observed. Osmotic potential became more negative in leaves of seedlings under severe stress. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit increased fructose, glucose, sucrose and myo-inositol levels in leaves. Stems accumulated fructose, glucose and <sc>l</sc>-proline. Nitric oxide (NO) levels increased in the vascular cylinder of roots under severe stress while superoxide anion levels decreased due to augmented superoxide dismutase activity in this organ. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit induced glutathione reductase activity in both roots and stems. Upon moderate or severe stress, catalase activity decreased in leaves and remained unaffected in the other seedling organs, allowing for an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) levels in leaves. Overall, the increase of signaling molecules in distinct organs—NO in roots, <sc>l</sc>-proline in stems and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and myo-inositol in leaves—contributed to the response of mahogany seedlings to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit by triggering biochemical processes that resulted in the attenuation of oxidative stress and the establishment of osmotic adjustment. Therefore, this body of evidence reveals that the development of newly germinated mahogany seedlings may occur in both natural habitats and crop fields even when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability is greatly limited.</p>

Intense threat switches dorsal raphe serotonin neurons to a paradoxical operational mode
<p>Survival depends on the selection of behaviors adaptive for the current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the sky. Although serotonin has been implicated in adaptive behavior, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that stimulation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments but induced escape behavior in high-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe serotonin neural dynamics inverted in high-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Stimulation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, and movement-related GABA neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Thus, dorsal raphe circuits switch between distinct operational modes to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment-specific adaptive behaviors.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> availability. In legumes, two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> pathways and root radial hydraulic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream hydraulic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> flow across roots. The explicit root hydraulic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root hydraulics.</p>

The Optimal Timing of Stage 2 Palliation for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In infants requiring 3-stage single-ventricle palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, attrition after the Norwood procedure remains significant. The effect of the timing of stage 2 palliation (S2P), a physician-modifiable factor, on long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al is not well understood. We hypothesized that an optimal interval between the Norwood and S2P that both minimizes pre-S2P attrition and maximizes post-S2P <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al exists and is associated with individual patient characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial public data set was used. Transplant-free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al (TFS) was modeled from (1) Norwood to S2P and (2) S2P to 3 years by using parametric hazard analysis. Factors associated with death or heart transplantation were determined for each interval. To account for staged procedures, risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood TFS (the probability of TFS at 3 years given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al to S2P) was calculated using parametric conditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al analysis. TFS from the Norwood to S2P was first predicted. TFS after S2P to 3 years was then predicted and adjusted for attrition before S2P by multiplying by the estimate of TFS to S2P. The optimal timing of S2P was determined by generating nomograms of risk-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood, TFS versus the interval from the Norwood to S2P.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 547 included patients, 399 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>ed to S2P (73%).

A Norwood-S2P interval of 3 to 6 months was associated with greatest 3-year TFS overall and in patients with few risk factors.

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of summer droughts in the northeastern deciduous forest of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an economically important native tree species, to soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of allocation of biomass, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative allocation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit due to shifts in biomass allocation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative allocation of root biomass to enhance its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> management.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest eco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental signals originating in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment implied that regulation of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Ribosomes on the night shift
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, life involves two simple goals: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al and reproduction. But these goals are fundamentally at odds. Reproduction depends on growth, but attempts to grow when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s are scarce can jeopardize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al. In cells, growth is accomplished in large part by ribosomes, huge RNA-protein machines that translate nucleic acid messages into protein, the main biochemical constituent of cells. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>-rich conditions, cells can be filled with ribosomes; they comprise more than a third of total biomass in rapidly growing <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>1</i>). But what happens to ribosomes when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong> levels decline, as occurs sporadically in microbes and nightly in sleeping humans? Biosynthesis subsides, and ribosomes now serve as a reservoir of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nutrient</span></strong>s. Building on recent progress probing the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation from Gu <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) and Abu-Remaileh <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>), on page 751 of this issue, Wyant <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) elucidate a pathway in which ribosomes are selectively digested, promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al in starved cells.</p>

Evidence suggests that known and unknown defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s are located in “defense islands” in microbial genomes. Here, we comprehensively characterized the bacterial defensive arsenal by examining gene families that are clustered next to known defense genes in prokaryotic genomes. Candidate defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>atically engineered and validated in model bacteria for their antiphage activities. We report nine previously unknown antiphage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s and one antiplasmid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> that are widespread in microbes and strongly protect against foreign invaders. These include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s that adopted components of the bacterial flagella and condensin complexes. Our data also suggest a common, ancient ancestry of innate immunity components shared between animals, plants, and bacteria.</p>

Water harvesting from air with metal-organic frameworks powered by natural sunlight
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> is a resource equivalent to ~10% of all fresh <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> in lakes on Earth. However, an efficient process for capturing and delivering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> from air, especially at low humidity levels (down to 20%), has not been developed. We report the design and demonstration of a device based on a porous metal-organic framework {MOF-801, [Zr<sub>6</sub>O<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>(fumarate)<sub>6</sub>]} that captures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e at ambient conditions by using low-grade heat from natural sunlight at a flux of less than 1 sun (1 kilowatt per square meter).

Mars’ atmospheric history derived from upper-atmosphere measurements of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar
<p>The history of Mars’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e is important for understanding the geological evolution and potential habitability of the planet. We determine the amount of gas lost to space through time using measurements of the upper-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic structure made by the Mars <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft. We derive the structure of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar between the homopause and exobase altitudes. Fractionation of argon occurs as a result of loss of gas to space by pickup-ion sputtering, which preferentially removes the lighter atom. The measurements require that 66% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic argon has been lost to space. Thus, a large fraction of Mars’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic gas has been lost to space, contributing to the transition in climate from an early, warm, wet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment to today’s cold, dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic CO<sub>2</sub>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic carbon and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> exchange under current, past, or future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, predominantly the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Nationwide Study of the Treatment of Mycotic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Comparing Open and Endovascular Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No reliable comparative data exist between open repair (OR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysms (MAAAs). This nationwide study assessed outcomes after OR and EVAR for MAAA in a population-based cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for MAAAs in Sweden between 1994 and 2014 were identified in the Swedish vascular registry. The primary aim was to assess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al after MAAA with OR and EVAR. Secondary aims were analyses of the rate of recurrent infections and reoperations, and time trends in surgical treatment. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. A propensity score–weighted correction for risk factor differences in the 2 groups was performed, including the operation year to account for differences in treatment and outcomes over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 132 patients (0.6% of all operated abdominal aortic aneurysms in Sweden). Mean age was 70 years (standard deviation, 9.2), and 50 presented with rupture. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al at 3 months was 86% (95% confidence interval, 80%–92%), at 1 year 79% (72%–86%), and at 5 years 59% (50%–68%). The preferred operative technique shifted from OR to EVAR after 2001 (proportion EVAR 1994–2000 0%, 2001–2007 58%, 2008–2014 60%). Open repair was performed in 62 patients (47%): aortic resection and extra-anatomic bypass (n=7), in situ reconstruction (n=50), and patch plasty (n=3); 2 patients died intraoperatively. EVAR was performed in 70 patients (53%): standard EVAR (n=55), fenestrated/branched EVAR (n=8), and visceral deviation with stent grafting (n=7); no deaths occurred intraoperatively. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al at 3 months was lower for OR than for EVAR (74% versus 96%, <i>P</i><0.001), with a similar trend present at 1 year (73% versus 84%, <i>P</i>=0.054). A propensity score–weighted risk-adjusted analysis confirmed the early better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al associated with EVAR.

Duration of Ventilations During Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation by Lay Rescuers and First Responders
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The 2010 guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation allow 5 seconds to give 2 breaths to deliver sufficient chest compressions and to keep perfusion pressure high. This study aims to determine whether the recommended short interruption for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ventil</span></strong>ations by trained lay rescuers and first responders can be achieved and to evaluate its consequence for chest compressions and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From a prospective data collection of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we used automatic external defibrillator recordings of cardiopulmonary resuscitation by rescuers who had received a standard European Resuscitation Council basic life support and automatic external defibrillator course. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ventil</span></strong>ation periods and total compressions delivered per minute during each 2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation cycle were measured, and the chest compression fraction was calculated.

We included 199 automatic external defibrillator recordings. The median interruption time for 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ventil</span></strong>ations was 7 seconds (25th–75th percentile, 6–9 seconds). Of all rescuers, 21% took <5 seconds and 83% took <10 seconds for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ventil</span></strong>ation period; 97%, 88%, and 63% of rescuers were able to deliver >60, >70, and >80 chest compressions per minute, respectively.

Late inception of a resiliently oxygenated upper ocean
<p>Rising oceanic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic oxygen levels through time have been crucial to enhanced habitability of surface Earth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Few redox proxies can track secular variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations around threshold levels for metazoan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al in the upper ocean. We present an extensive compilation of iodine-to-calcium ratios (I/Ca) in marine carbonates. Our record supports a major rise in the partial pressure of oxygen in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e at ~400 million years (Ma) ago and reveals a step change in the oxygenation of the upper ocean to relatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sustain</span></strong>able near-modern conditions at ~200 Ma ago. An Earth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> model demonstrates that a shift in organic matter remineralization to greater depths, which may have been due to increasing size and biomineralization of eukaryotic plankton, likely drove the I/Ca signals at ~200 Ma ago.</p>

Connecting neuronal circuits for movement
<p>Movement is the most common final output of nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> activity and is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al. But what makes this seemingly trivial statement so scientifically challenging? Neurons that contribute to when and how our body moves are distributed throughout the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Thus, even a simple movement such as arm flexion requires the coordinated activation of many different neuronal populations across multiple brain regions. A key question is how the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> produces diverse and precise actions aligned with the organisms' behavioral needs. These processes are affected in diseases such as Parkinson's or Huntington's, in which aberrant motor behavior dominates. Recent studies are transformative in how we think about the control of movement. A common denominator of these studies is that brain regions that contribute to motor behavior can no longer be considered as interacting boxes. Instead, deep circuit-level insight based on specific neuronal populations emerges as being critical to revealing motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> organization and understanding its function. It is likely that insights at this level can also help to design more specific and direct interventions for diseases of the motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and neuroprosthetics applied after injuries.</p>

These results provide much-needed feedback for theories describing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-mediated surface interactions and the behavior of interfacial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>, and show a way to investigate the dielectric properties of other fluids and solids under extreme confinement.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> molecule resembles that in neat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Breakup of last glacial deep stratification in the South Pacific

Enhanced water permeability and tunable ion selectivity in subnanometer carbon nanotube porins

CNTPs block anion transport, even at salinities that exceed sea<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> levels, and their ion selectivity can be tuned to configure them into switchable ionic diodes.

<p>A correlation between giant-planet mass and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic heavy elemental abundance was first noted in the past century from observations of planets in our own Solar System and has served as a cornerstone of planet-formation theory. Using data from the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes from 0.5 to 5 micrometers, we conducted a detailed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic study of the transiting Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-26b. We detected prominent H<sub>2</sub>O absorption bands with a maximum base-to-peak amplitude of 525 parts per million in the transmission spectrum. Using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> abundance as a proxy for metallicity, we measured HAT-P-26b’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic heavy element content ([Formula] times solar). This likely indicates that HAT-P-26b’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e is primordial and obtained its gaseous envelope late in its disk lifetime, with little contamination from metal-rich planetesimals.</p>

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants
<p>Non-cell autonomous RNA silencing can spread from cell to cell and over long distances in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile gene silencing are poorly understood. Here, we identified a <i>DICER-LIKE2</i> (<i>DCL2</i>)<i>-</i>dependent mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic spread of posttranscriptional RNA silencing, also known as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Using a suite of transgenic <i>DCL</i> RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that <i>N. benthamiana</i> DCL1, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22, 24, and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of <i>DCL2</i> expression reduced the spread of gene silencing, while suppression of <i>DCL3</i> or <i>DCL4</i> expression enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. In contrast to <i>DCL4</i> RNAi lines, <i>DCL2</i>-<i>DCL4</i> double-RNAi lines developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS similar to that observed in <i>DCL2</i> RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that <i>DCL2</i> was required in the scion to respond to the signal, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated <i>DCL</i> genetic pathway in which <i>DCL2</i> plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, while both <i>DCL4</i> and <i>DCL3</i> attenuate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. We discuss the potential role of 21, 22, and 24 nt siRNAs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p>Drought stress is one of the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-limiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to drought stress through its control of stomatal aperture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the drought tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are controlled by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by drought stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hypersensitivity and improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a controlled drought-stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the control of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein stability, representing a novel control point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behavior under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under control and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit compared with control conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control conditions, 106 were detected under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong>-deficit stress.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf hydraulic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During drought-induced dehydration, the leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the hydraulic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem hydraulic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport under mild to moderate soil and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> transport during progressive drought.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> motion by the lateral line <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and the mechanism of generating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">water</span></strong> motion by mouth suction.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. We suggest that sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Long-term outcomes of cemented <i>versus</i> cementless humeral components in arthroplasty of the shoulder
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In the initial development of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA),   the humeral component was usually fixed with cement. Cementless   components were subsequently introduced. The aim of this study was   to compare the long-term outcome of cemented and cementless humeral   components in arthroplasty of the shoulder.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients who underwent primary arthroplasty of the shoulder   at our institution between 1970 and 2012 were included in the study.   There were 4636 patients with 1167 cemented humeral components and   3469 cementless components. Patients with the two types of fixation   were matched for nine different covariates using a propensity score   analysis. A total of 551 well-balanced pairs of patients with cemented   and cementless components were available after matching for comparison   of the outcomes. The clinical outcomes which were analysed included loosening   of the humeral component determined at revision surgery, periprosthetic   fractures, post-operative infection and operating time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The overall five-, ten-, 15- and 20-year rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al were   98.9%, 97.2%, 95.5%, and 94.4%, respectively. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al without loosening   at 20 years was 98% for cemented components and 92.4% for cementless   components. After propensity score matching including fixation as   determined by the design of the component, humeral loosening was   also found to be significantly higher in the cementless group. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al   without humeral loosening at 20 years was 98.7% for cemented components   and 91.0% for cementless components. There was no significant difference   in the risk of intra- or post-operative fracture.

Anterior knee pain and evidence of osteoarthritis of the patellofemoral joint should not be considered contraindications to mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It is not clear whether anterior knee pain and osteoarthritis   (OA) of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) are contraindications to   medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA). Our aim was to   investigate the long-term outcome of a consecutive series of patients,   some of whom had anterior knee pain and PFJ OA managed with UKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We assessed the ten-year functional outcomes and 15-year implant   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al of 805 knees (677 patients) following medial mobile-bearing   UKA. The intra-operative status of the PFJ was documented and, with   the exception of bone loss with grooving to the lateral side, neither   the clinical or radiological state of the PFJ nor the presence of   anterior knee pain were considered a contraindication. The impact   of radiographic findings and anterior knee pain was studied in a   subgroup of 100 knees (91 patients).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no relationship between functional outcomes, at a mean   of ten years, or 15-year implant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al, and pre-operative anterior   knee pain, or the presence or degree of cartilage loss documented   intra-operatively at the medial patella or trochlea, or radiographic   evidence of OA in the medial side of the PFJ. In 6% of cases there   was full thickness cartilage loss on the lateral side of the patella.   In these cases, the overall ten-year function and 15-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al   was similar to those without cartilage loss; however they had slightly   more difficulty with descending stairs.

Impact of Bystander Automated External Defibrillator Use on Survival and Functional Outcomes in Shockable Observed Public Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable rhythms can be improved with early defibrillation. Although shockable OHCA accounts for only ≈25% of overall arrests, ≈60% of public OHCAs are shockable, offering the possibility of restoring thousands of individuals to full recovery with early defibrillation by bystanders. We sought to determine the association of bystander automated external defibrillator use with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al and functional outcomes in shockable observed public OHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium prospectively collected detailed information on all cardiac arrests at 9 regional centers. The exposures were shock administration by a bystander-applied automated external defibrillator in comparison with initial defibrillation by emergency medical services. The primary outcome measure was discharge with normal or near-normal (favorable) functional status defined as a modified Rankin Score ≤2. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al to hospital discharge was the secondary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 49 555 OHCAs, 4115 (8.3%) observed public OHCAs were analyzed, of which 2500 (60.8%) were shockable.

Patients shocked by a bystander were significantly more likely to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>e to discharge (66.5% versus 43.0%) and be discharged with favorable functional outcome (57.1% versus 32.7%) than patients initially shocked by emergency medical services. After adjusting for known predictors of outcome, the odds ratio associated with a bystander shock was 2.62 (95% confidence interval, 2.07–3.31) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al to hospital discharge and 2.73 (95% confidence interval, 2.17–3.44) for discharge with favorable functional outcome. The benefit of bystander shock increased progressively as emergency medical services response time became longer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Bystander automated external defibrillator use before emergency medical services arrival in shockable observed public OHCA was associated with better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">surviv</span></strong>al and functional outcomes.

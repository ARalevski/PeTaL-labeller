Fast molecular outflow from a dusty star-forming galaxy in the early Universe
<p>Galaxies grow inefficiently, with only a small percentage of the available gas converted into stars each free-fall time. Feedback processes, such as outflowing winds driven by radiation pressure, supernovae, or supermassive black hole accretion, can act to halt star formation if they heat or expel the gas supply. We report a molecular outflow launched from a dust-rich star-forming galaxy at redshift 5.3, 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The outflow reaches velocities up to 800 kilometers per second relative to the galaxy, is resolved into multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clump</span></strong>s, and carries mass at a rate within a factor of 2 of the star formation rate. Our results show that molecular outflows can remove a large fraction of the gas available for star formation from galaxies at high redshift.</p>

MFN2 agonists reverse mitochondrial defects in preclinical models of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A
<p>Mitofusins (MFNs) promote fusion-mediated mitochondrial content exchange and subcellular trafficking. Mutations in <i>Mfn2</i> cause neurodegenerative Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A). We showed that MFN2 activity can be determined by Met<sup>376</sup> and His<sup>380</sup> interactions with Asp<sup>725</sup> and Leu<sup>727</sup> and controlled by PINK1 kinase–mediated phosphorylation of adjacent MFN2 Ser<sup>378</sup>. Small-molecule mimics of the peptide-peptide interface of MFN2 disrupted this interaction, allosterically activating MFN2 and promoting mitochondrial fusion. These first-in-class mitofusin agonists overcame dominant mitochondrial defects provoked in cultured neurons by CMT2A mutants MFN2 Arg<sup>94</sup>→Gln<sup>94</sup> and MFN2 Thr<sup>105</sup>→Met<sup>105</sup>, as demonstrated by amelioration of mitochondrial dysmotility, fragmentation, depolarization, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">clump</span></strong>ing. A mitofusin agonist normalized axonal mitochondrial trafficking within sciatic nerves of MFN2 Thr<sup>105</sup>→Met<sup>105</sup> mice, promising a therapeutic approach for CMT2A and other untreatable diseases of impaired neuronal mitochondrial dynamism and/or trafficking.</p>

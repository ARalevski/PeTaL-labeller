Digital nature: Are field trips a thing of the past?
<p>I awoke in my cabin by the pond. Weighing my options for the day, I decided to do some bird <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">watch</span></strong>ing, winding between white pines and blackberries along the east shore of the pond. By their songs, I was able to identify a Mourning Dove, Blue Jays, an American Crow, and perhaps a Northern Cardinal. A mink, alarmed by my approach, dove into the pond and swam off. Unable to resist on such a sunny day, I waded into the pond and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">watch</span></strong>ed the sunlight play around me in the shallows. My mood that morning was appropriately reflected by my status indicators: moderately inspired, tired, and hungry. My hike took place in <i>Walden, a Game</i>, a video game recently launched on the 200th birthday of Henry David Thoreau (<i>1</i>). With a widening niche of such nature-themed video games and simulations and a rapidly growing audience of online/digital learners, the capacity to reach new audiences and carry environmental education beyond the confines of schools and universities may be a game changer, but one that perhaps comes with perils.</p>

Bot-hunters eye mischief in German election
<p>With Germans going to the polls on 24 September to elect their new parliament, experts are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">watch</span></strong>ing closely for signs of automated propaganda on social networks. So far, bots—fake social media profiles that appear to be human users but are really driven by algorithms—seem less active than they did in the recent presidential elections in France and the United States, where some commentators believe Russia was seeking to boost right-wing candidates. But researchers sensitized by past elections are making the German contest a laboratory for studies of how to recognize bots and trace their effects. Teams are trawling tens of millions of tweets related to the German elections for signs that bots are exerting influence.</p>

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience. As explosions pattern the sky, the visual system must capture information about the time-varying positions, colors, and contrasts of myriad spots of light. This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural circuits that map visual space. To generate this retinotopy (visual mapping), neurons must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved? The molecules that regulate neuronal differentiation have been described in detail, as have the cues that allow differentiated neurons to reach and choose their synaptic partners (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, the mechanisms that coordinate neuronal specification with the development of retinotopic circuit wiring have remained elusive. On page 886 of this issue, Fernandes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that in the visual system of flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), photoreceptors use glial cells as intermediaries to communicate with their neural targets to generate retinotopic circuits.</p>

Molecular-Level Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Dopaminergic Signaling
<sec><title>Watching Brain Molecules</title><p>Functional neuroimaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) molecular sensors would be useful for mechanistic analysis of neural systems. <bold>Lee <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 533) applied MRI-detectable sensors to measure molecular aspects of brain function in conjunction with noninvasive imaging. The molecular sensor revealed a quantitative spatiotemporal map of dopamine release in the ventral striatum, a brain area involved in processing rewards.</p></sec>

Timing and context of dolphin clicks during and after mine simulator detection and marking in the open ocean
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Dolphins wore cameras so we could hear them and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">watch</span></strong> them mark mine simulators. We observed rhythmic click trains, victory squeals, and click packets with their behavioral context.</p>

Mid-term results of the BIOLOX delta ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We conducted a prospective study of a delta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic total hip   arthroplasty (THA) to determine the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic fracture, to   characterise post-operative noise, and to evaluate the mid-term   results and survivorship.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between March 2009 and March 2011, 274 patients (310 hips) underwent   cementless THA using a delta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic femoral head and liner. At   each follow-up, clinical and radiological outcomes were recorded.   A Kaplan-Meier analysis was undertaken to estimate survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Four patients (four hips) died and 18 patients (20 hips) were   lost to follow-up within five years. The remaining 252 patients   (286 hips) were followed for a mean of 66.5 months (60 to 84). There   were 144 men (166 hips) and 108 women (120 hips) with a mean age   of 49.7 years (16 to 83) at surgery. The mean pre-operative Harris   Hip Score of 47.1 points improved to 93.8 points at final follow-up.   Six patients reported squeaking in seven hips; however, none were   audible. Radiolucent lines involving Gruen zones one and/or seven   were seen in 52 hips (18.2%). No hip had detectable wear, focal   osteolysis or signs of loosening. One hip was revised because of   fracture of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic liner, which occurred due to an undetected   malseating of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic liner at the time of surgery. One hip   was revised for a periprosthetic fracture of the femur, and one   hip was treated for periprosthetic joint infection.

A synthetic polymer system with repeatable chemical recyclability
<p>The development of chemically recyclable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>ers offers a solution to the end-of-use issue of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>eric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als and provides a closed-loop approach toward a circular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als economy. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>ers that can be easily and selectively de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>erized back to monomers typically require low-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>erization methods and also lack physical properties and mechanical strengths required for practical uses. We introduce a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er system based on γ-butyrolactone (GBL) with a trans-ring fusion at the α and β positions. Such trans-ring fusion renders the commonly considered as non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>erizable GBL ring readily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>erizable at room temperature under solvent-free conditions to yield a high–molecular weight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er has enhanced thermostability and can be repeatedly and quantitatively recycled back to its monomer by thermolysis or chemolysis. Mixing of the two enantiomers of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er generates a highly crystalline supramolecular stereocomplex.</p>

A molecular perovskite solid solution with piezoelectricity stronger than lead zirconate titanate
<p>Piezoelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als produce electricity when strained, making them ideal for different types of sensing applications. The most effective piezoelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic solid solutions in which the piezoelectric effect is optimized at what are termed morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ics are not ideal for a variety of applications owing to some of their mechanical properties. We synthesized piezoelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als from a molecular perovskite (TMFM)<i><sub>x</sub></i>(TMCM)<sub>1–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>CdCl<sub>3</sub> solid solution (TMFM, trimethylfluoromethyl ammonium; TMCM, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium, 0 ≤ <i>x</i> ≤ 1), in which the MPB exists between monoclinic and hexagonal phases. We found a composition for which the piezoelectric coefficient <i>d</i><sub>33</sub> is ~1540 picocoulombs per newton, comparable to high-performance piezoelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ics. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al has potential applications for wearable piezoelectric devices.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin coating either solutions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al or precursors to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Metal-free three-dimensional perovskite ferroelectrics
<p>Inorganic perovskite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferroelectr</span></strong>ics are widely used in nonvolatile memory elements, capacitors, and sensors because of their excellent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferroelectr</span></strong>ic and other properties. Organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferroelectr</span></strong>ics are desirable for their mechanical flexibility, low weight, environmentally friendly processing, and low processing temperatures. Although almost a century has passed since the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferroelectr</span></strong>ic, Rochelle salt, was discovered, examples of highly desirable organic perovskite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferroelectr</span></strong>ics are lacking. We found a family of metal-free organic perovskite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferroelectr</span></strong>ics with the characteristic three-dimensional structure, among which MDABCO (<i>N</i>-methyl-<i>N'</i>-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium)–ammonium triiodide has a spontaneous polarization of 22 microcoulombs per square centimeter [close to that of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barium titan</span></strong>ate (BTO)], a high phase transition temperature of 448 kelvins (above that of BTO), and eight possible polarization directions. These attributes make it attractive for use in flexible devices, soft robotics, biomedical devices, and other applications.</p>

Mechanically robust, readily repairable polymers via tailored noncovalent cross-linking
<p>Expanding the range of healable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als is an important challenge for sustainable societies. Noncrystalline, high-molecular-weight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>ers generally form mechanically robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, which, however, are difficult to repair once they are fractured. This is because their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er chains are heavily entangled and diffuse too sluggishly to unite fractured surfaces within reasonable time scales. Here we report that low-molecular-weight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>ers, when cross-linked by dense hydrogen bonds, yield mechanically robust yet readily repairable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, despite their extremely slow diffusion dynamics. A key was to use thiourea, which anomalously forms a zigzag hydrogen-bonded array that does not induce unfavorable crystallization. Another key was to incorporate a structural element for activating the exchange of hydrogen-bonded pairs, which enables the fractured portions to rejoin readily upon compression.</p>

Poly[<i>n</i>]catenanes: Synthesis of molecular interlocked chains

Poly[<i>n</i>]catenanes, where the molecular chains consist solely of interlocked macrocycles, contain one of the highest concentrations of topological bonds.

High-performance vitrimers from commodity thermoplastics through dioxaborolane metathesis
<p>Windmills, cars, and dental restoration demand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als and composites that are easy to process, assemble, and recycle while exhibiting outstanding mechanical, thermal, and chemical resistance. Vitrimers, which are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er networks able to shuffle chemical bonds through exchange reactions, could address these demands if they were prepared from existing plastics and processed with fast production rates and current equipment. We report the metathesis of dioxaborolanes, which is rapid and thermally robust, and use it to prepare vitrimers from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>ers as different as poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, and high-density polyethylene that, although permanently cross-linked, can be processed multiple times by means of extrusion or injection molding. They show superior chemical resistance and dimensional stability and can be efficiently assembled.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of an atomically thin material using a single-spin qubit

Coherent manipulation of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers enables the probing of nanoscale ensembles down to approximately 30 nuclear spins in atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The characterization of low-dimensional nanoscale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als could enable the development of new quantum hybrid systems, combining atomlike systems coherently coupled with individual atoms in 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als.</p>

Ceramic-on-ceramic bearing fractures in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic-on-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic (CoC) bearings in total hip arthroplasty (THA)   are commonly used, but concerns exist regarding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic fracture.   This study aims to report the risk of revision for fracture of modern   CoC bearings and identify factors that might influence this risk,   using data from the National Joint Registry (NJR) for England, Wales, Northern   Ireland and the Isle of Man.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We analysed data on 223 362 bearings from 111 681 primary CoC   THAs and 182 linked revisions for bearing fracture recorded in the   NJR. We used implant codes to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic bearing composition   and generated Kaplan-Meier estimates for implant survivorship. Logistic   regression analyses were performed for implant size and patient specific   variables to determine any associated risks for revision.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 852 bearings (99.8%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>Tec Biolox products.   Revisions for fracture were linked to seven of 79 442 (0.009%) Biolox   Delta heads, 38 of 31 982 (0.119%) Biolox Forte heads, 101 of 80   170 (0.126%) Biolox Delta liners and 35 of 31 258 (0.112%) Biolox   Forte liners. Regression analysis of implant size revealed smaller   heads had significantly higher odds of fracture (chi-squared 68.0,   p < 0.001). The highest fracture risk was observed in the 28 mm   Biolox Forte subgroup (0.382%). There were no fractures in the 40   mm head group for either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic type. Liner thickness was not predictive   of fracture (p = 0.67). Body mass index (BMI) was independently   associated with revision for both head fractures (odds ratio (OR)   1.09 per unit increase, p = 0.031) and liner fractures (OR 1.06   per unit increase, p = 0.006). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report the largest independent study of CoC bearing fractures   to date. The risk of revision for CoC bearing fracture is very low   but previous studies have underestimated this risk.

Volumetric additive manufacturing via tomographic reconstruction
<p>Additive manufacturing promises enormous geometrical freedom and the potential to combine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als for complex functions. The speed, geometry, and surface quality limitations of additive processes are linked to their reliance on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al layering.

We printed features as small as 0.3 millimeters in engineering acrylate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>ers and printed soft structures with exceptionally smooth surfaces into a gelatin methacrylate hydrogel.

Mechanoresponsive self-growing hydrogels inspired by muscle training
<p>Living tissues, such as muscle, autonomously grow and remodel themselves to adapt to their surrounding mechanical environment through metabolic processes. By contrast, typical synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als cannot grow and reconstruct their structures once formed. We propose a strategy for developing “self-growing” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>eric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als that respond to repetitive mechanical stress through an effective mechanochemical transduction. Robust double-network hydrogels provided with a sustained monomer supply undergo self-growth, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als are substantially strengthened under repetitive loading through a structural destruction-reconstruction process. This strategy also endows the hydrogels with tailored functions at desired positions by mechanical stamping. This work may pave the way for the development of self-growing gel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als for applications such as soft robots and intelligent devices.</p>

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials
<p>Although flakes of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures at the micrometer scale can be formed with adhesive-tape exfoliation methods, isolation of 2D flakes into monolayers is extremely time consuming because it is a trial-and-error process. Controlling the number of 2D layers through direct growth also presents difficulty because of the high nucleation barrier on 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. We demonstrate a layer-resolved 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al splitting technique that permits high-throughput production of multiple monolayers of wafer-scale (5-centimeter diameter) 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als by splitting single stacks of thick 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als grown on a single wafer.

A nonconjugated radical polymer glass with high electrical conductivity
<p>Solid-state conducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>ers usually have highly conjugated macromolecular backbones and require intentional doping in order to achieve high electrical conductivities. Conversely, single-component, charge-neutral macromolecules could be synthetically simpler and have improved processibility and ambient stability. We show that poly(4-glycidyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl), a nonconjugated radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er with a subambient glass transition temperature, underwent rapid solid-state charge transfer reactions and had an electrical conductivity of up to 28 siemens per meter over channel lengths up to 0.6 micrometers. The charge transport through the radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er film was enabled with thermal annealing at 80°C, which allowed for the formation of a percolating network of open-shell sites in electronic communication with one another. The electrical conductivity was not enhanced by intentional doping, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thin film</span></strong>s of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al showed high optical transparency.</p>

A generic interface to reduce the efficiency-stability-cost gap of perovskite solar cells
<p>A major bottleneck delaying the further commercialization of thin-film solar cells based on hybrid organohalide lead perovskites is interface loss in state-of-the-art devices. We present a generic interface architecture that combines solution-processed, reliable, and cost-efficient hole-transporting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als without compromising efficiency, stability, or scalability of perovskite solar cells. Tantalum-doped tungsten oxide (Ta-WO<i><sub>x</sub></i>)/conjugated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er multilayers offer a surprisingly small interface barrier and form quasi-ohmic contacts universally with various scalable conjugated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>ers. In a simple device with regular planar architecture and a self-assembled monolayer, Ta-WO<i><sub>x</sub></i>–doped interface–based perovskite solar cells achieve maximum efficiencies of 21.2% and offer more than 1000 hours of light stability. By eliminating additional ionic dopants, these findings open up the entire class of organics as scalable hole-transporting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als for perovskite solar cells.</p>

Single polymer growth dynamics
<p>In chain-growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>erization, a chain grows continually to reach thousands of subunits. However, the real-time dynamics of chain growth remains unknown. Using magnetic tweezers, we visualized real-time <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er growth at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er level. Focusing on ring-opening metathesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>erization, we found that the extension of a growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er under a pulling force does not increase continuously but exhibits wait-and-jump steps. These steps are attributable to the formation and unraveling of conformational entanglements from newly incorporated monomers, whose key features can be recapitulated with molecular dynamics simulations. The configurations of these entanglements appear to play a key role in determining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>erization rates and the dispersion among individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>ers.</p>

Highly stretchable polymer semiconductor films through the nanoconfinement effect
<p>Soft and conformable wearable electronics require stretchable semiconductors, but existing ones typically sacrifice charge transport mobility to achieve stretchability. We explore a concept based on the nanoconfinement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>ers to substantially improve the stretchability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er semiconductors, without affecting charge transport mobility. The increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er chain dynamics under nanoconfinement significantly reduces the modulus of the conjugated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er and largely delays the onset of crack formation under strain. As a result, our fabricated semiconducting film can be stretched up to 100% strain without affecting mobility, retaining values comparable to that of amorphous silicon. The fully stretchable transistors exhibit high biaxial stretchability with minimal change in on current even when poked with a sharp object. We demonstrate a skinlike finger-wearable driver for a light-emitting diode.</p>

Synthetic nacre by predesigned matrix-directed mineralization
<p>Although biomimetic designs are expected to play a key role in exploring future structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, facile fabrication of bulk biomimetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als under ambient conditions remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a mesoscale “assembly-and-mineralization” approach inspired by the natural process in mollusks to fabricate bulk synthetic nacre that highly resembles both the chemical composition and the hierarchical structure of natural nacre. The millimeter-thick synthetic nacre consists of alternating organic layers and aragonite platelet layers (91 weight percent) and exhibits good ultimate strength and fracture toughness. This predesigned matrix-directed mineralization method represents a rational strategy for the preparation of robust composite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als with hierarchically ordered structures, where various constituents are adaptable, including brittle and heat-labile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als.</p>

Recyclable, Strong Thermosets and Organogels via Paraformaldehyde Condensation with Diamines

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Hydroxystilbenes Are Monomers in Palm Fruit Endocarp Lignins
<p>Lignin, the plant cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er that binds fibers together but makes processing difficult, is traditionally formed from three monomers, the so-called monolignols (<i>p</i>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). Recently, we discovered, in grass lignins, a phenolic monomer that falls outside the canonical lignin biosynthetic pathway, the flavone tricin. As we show here, palm fruit (macaéíéííéíúba [<i>Acrocomia aculeata</i>], carnauba [<i>Copernicia prunifera</i>], and coconut [<i>Cocos nucifera</i>]) endocarps contain lignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>ers derived in part from a previously unconsidered class of lignin monomers, the hydroxystilbenes, including the valuable compounds piceatannol and resveratrol. Piceatannol could be released from these lignins upon derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, a degradative method that cleaves β-ether bonds, indicating that at least a fraction is incorporated through labile ether bonds. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of products from the co<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>erization of piceatannol and monolignols confirms the structures in the natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er and demonstrates that piceatannol acts as an authentic monomer participating in coupling and cross-coupling reactions during lignification. Therefore, palm fruit endocarps contain a new class of stilbenolignin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>ers, further expanding the definition of lignin and implying that compounds such as piceatannol and resveratrol are potentially available in what is now essentially a waste product.</p>

Terahertz field–induced ferroelectricity in quantum paraelectric SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
<p>“Hidden phases” are metastable collective states of matter that are typically not accessible on equilibrium phase diagrams. These phases can host exotic properties in otherwise conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als and hence may enable novel functionality and applications, but their discovery and access are still in early stages. Using intense terahertz electric field excitation, we found that an ultrafast phase transition into a hidden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ferroelectr</span></strong>ic phase can be dynamically induced in quantum paraelectric strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>). The induced lowering in crystal symmetry yields substantial changes in the phonon excitation spectra.

Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The metal-insulator transition in correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition. This coupling not only complicates the understanding of the basic mechanism of this phenomenon but also limits the speed and endurance of prospective electronic devices. We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven metal-insulator transition in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an interface interaction suppresses the electronic correlations without changing the crystal structure in this otherwise correlated insulator. This interaction stabilizes a nonequilibrium metallic phase and leads to an isostructural metal-insulator transition. This discovery will provide insights into phase transitions of correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als and may aid the design of device functionalities.</p>

Multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles and superb mechanical behaviors of complex alloys
<p>Alloy design based on single–principal-element systems has approached its limit for performance enhancements. A substantial increase in strength up to gigapascal levels typically causes the premature failure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als with reduced ductility. Here, we report a strategy to break this trade-off by controllably introducing high-density ductile multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles (MCINPs) in complex alloy systems. Distinct from the intermetallic-induced embrittlement under conventional wisdom, such MCINP-strengthened alloys exhibit superior strengths of 1.5 gigapascals and ductility as high as 50% in tension at ambient temperature. The plastic instability, a major concern for high-strength <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, can be completely eliminated by generating a distinctive multistage work-hardening behavior, resulting from pronounced dislocation activities and deformation-induced microbands. This MCINP strategy offers a paradigm to develop next-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als for structural applications.</p>

High thermal conductivity in cubic boron arsenide crystals
<p>The high density of heat generated in power electronics and optoelectronic devices is a critical bottleneck in their application. New <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als with high thermal conductivity are needed to effectively dissipate heat and thereby enable enhanced performance of power controls, solid-state lighting, communication, and security systems. We report the experimental discovery of high thermal conductivity at room temperature in cubic boron arsenide (BAs) grown through a modified chemical vapor transport technique. The thermal conductivity of BAs, 1000 ± 90 watts per meter per kelvin meter-kelvin, is higher than that of silicon carbide by a factor of 3 and is surpassed only by diamond and the basal-plane value of graphite. This work shows that BAs represents a class of ultrahigh–thermal conductivity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als predicted by a recent theory, and that it may constitute a useful thermal management <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al for high–power density electronic devices.</p>

Our spectroscopy study, in conjunction with atomistic theory, reveals that the distinctive band structure of BAs allows for very long phonon mean free paths and strong high-order anharmonicity through the four-phonon process. The single-crystal BAs has better thermal conductivity than other metals and semiconductors.

High dislocation density–induced large ductility in deformed and partitioned steels

Unfortunately, the strategies for increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al strength, such as processing to create line defects (dislocations), tend to decrease ductility. We developed a strategy to circumvent this in inexpensive, medium manganese steel. Cold rolling followed by low-temperature tempering developed steel with metastable austenite grains embedded in a highly dislocated martensite matrix. This deformed and partitioned (D and P) process produced dislocation hardening but retained high ductility, both through the glide of intensive mobile dislocations and by allowing us to control martensitic transformation. The D and P strategy should apply to any other alloy with deformation-induced martensitic transformation and provides a pathway for the development of high-strength, high-ductility <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als.</p>

The risk   for aseptic loosening of the acetabular component was higher in group   1 (p = 0.04, Hazard Ratio (HR) 4.99), dysplastic acetabula (p =   0.01, HR 4.12), components outside Lewinnek's zone (p < 0.001,   HR 6.13) and in those with a hip rotation centre distance greater   than 5 mm (p = 0.005, HR 4.09). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Alumina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic-on-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ceram</span></strong>ic THA is an excellent option for young   patients.

A comparison study of stem taper material loss at similar and mixed metal head-neck taper junctions
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We sought to determine whether cobalt-chromium alloy (CoCr) femoral   stem tapers (trunnions) wear more than titanium (Ti) alloy stem   tapers (trunnions) when used in a large diameter (LD) metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip arthroplasty system.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed explant analysis using validated methodology to   determine the volumetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al loss at the taper surfaces of   explanted LD CoCr MoM hip arthroplasties used with either a Ti alloy   (n = 28) or CoCr femoral stem (n = 21). Only 12/14 taper constructs   with a rough male taper surface and a nominal included angle close   to 5.666° were included. Multiple regression modelling was undertaken   using taper angle, taper roughness, bearing diameter (horizontal   lever arm) as independent variables. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al loss was mapped using   a coordinate measuring machine, profilometry and scanning electron   microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After adjustment for other factors, CoCr stem tapers were found   to have significantly greater volumetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al loss than the   equivalent Ti stem tapers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When taper junction damage is identified during revision of a   LD MoM hip, it should be suspected that a male taper composed of   a standard CoCr alloy has sustained significant changes to the taper   cone geometry which are likely to be more extensive than those affecting   a Ti alloy stem.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1304–12.</p></sec>

Hydrogenation of fluoroarenes: Direct access to all-<i>cis</i>-(multi)fluorinated cycloalkanes
<p>All-c<i>is</i>-multifluorinated cycloalkanes exhibit intriguing electronic properties. In particular, they display extremely high dipole moments perpendicular to the aliphatic ring, making them highly desired motifs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al science. Very few such motifs have been prepared, as their syntheses require multistep sequences from diastereoselectively prefunctionalized precursors. Herein we report a synthetic strategy to access these valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als via the rhodium–cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)–catalyzed hydrogenation of readily available fluorinated arenes in hexane. This route enables the scalable single-step preparation of an abundance of multisubstituted and multifluorinated cycloalkanes, including all-<i>cis</i>-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane as well as cis-configured fluorinated aliphatic heterocycles.</p>

Eye patches: Protein assembly of index-gradient squid lenses
<p>A parabolic relationship between lens radius and refractive index allows spherical lenses to avoid spherical aberration. We show that in squid, patchy colloidal physics resulted from an evolutionary radiation of globular S-crystallin proteins. Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments on lens tissue show colloidal gels of S-crystallins at all radial positions. Sparse lens <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als form via low-valence linkages between disordered loops protruding from the protein surface. The loops are polydisperse and bind via a set of hydrogen bonds between disordered side chains. Peripheral lens regions with low particle valence form stable, volume-spanning gels at low density, whereas central regions with higher average valence gel at higher densities. The proteins demonstrate an evolved set of linkers for self-assembly of nanoparticles into volumetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als.</p>

Highly elastic binders integrating polyrotaxanes for silicon microparticle anodes in lithium ion batteries
<p>Lithium-ion batteries with ever-increasing energy densities are needed for batteries for advanced devices and all-electric vehicles. Silicon has been highlighted as a promising anode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al because of its superior specific capacity. During repeated charge-discharge cycles, silicon undergoes huge volume changes. This limits cycle life via particle pulverization and an unstable electrode-electrolyte interface, especially when the particle sizes are in the micrometer range. We show that the incorporation of 5 weight % polyrotaxane to conventional polyacrylic acid binder imparts extraordinary elasticity to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polym</span></strong>er network originating from the ring sliding motion of polyrotaxane. This binder combination keeps even pulverized silicon particles coalesced without disintegration, enabling stable cycle life for silicon microparticle anodes at commercial-level areal capacities.</p>

Neutron scattering in the proximate quantum spin liquid α-RuCl<sub>3</sub>
<p>The Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL) is an exotic emergent state of matter exhibiting Majorana fermion and gauge flux excitations. The magnetic insulator α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> is thought to realize a proximate KQSL. We used neutron scattering on single crystals of α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> to reconstruct dynamical correlations in energy-momentum space. We discovered highly unusual signals, including a column of scattering over a large energy interval around the Brillouin zone center, which is very stable with temperature. This finding is consistent with scattering from the Majorana excitations of a KQSL. Other, more delicate experimental features can be transparently associated with perturbations to an ideal model. Our results encourage further study of this prototypical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al and may open a window into investigating emergent magnetic Majorana fermions in correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als.</p>

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes
<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a plume of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al erupts from cracks in the ice. The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. The relatively high hydrogen abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of methane from CO<sub>2</sub> in Enceladus’ ocean.</p>

Hydrogen positions in single nanocrystals revealed by electron diffraction
<p>The localization of hydrogen atoms is an essential part of crystal structure analysis, but it is difficult because of their small scattering power. We report the direct localization of hydrogen atoms in nanocrystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, achieved using the recently developed approach of dynamical refinement of precession electron diffraction tomography data. We used this method to locate hydrogen atoms in both an organic (paracetamol) and an inorganic (framework cobalt aluminophosphate) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al. The results demonstrate that the technique can reliably reveal fine structural details, including the positions of hydrogen atoms in single crystals with micro- to nanosized dimensions.</p>

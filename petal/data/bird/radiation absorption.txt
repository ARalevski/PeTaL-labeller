Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling draws heat from surfaces and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>es it into space as infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling as a viable energy technology.</p>

Synchrotron radiation from an accelerating light pulse
<p>Synchrotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion—namely, electromagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion produced by charges moving in a curved path—is regularly generated at large-scale facilities where giga–electron volt electrons move along kilometer-long circular paths. We use a metasurface to bend light and demonstrate synchrotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion produced by a subpicosecond pulse, which moves along a circular arc of radius 100 micrometers inside a nonlinear crystal. The emitted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, in the terahertz frequency range, results from the nonlinear polarization induced by the pulse. The generation of synchrotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion from a pulse revolving about a circular trajectory holds promise for the development of on-chip terahertz sources.</p>

Using DNA, radiation therapy gets personal
<p>At most cancer hospitals today, medical oncologists routinely order genetic tests that help guide their drug treatment decisions. But down the hallway in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion ward, cancer patients typically get a one-size-fits-all course of radiotherapy, regardless of their genetics or those of their cancer. A small but increasing number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion oncologists is hoping to change that. At the annual meeting of the American Society for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion Oncology next week in Boston, researchers will describe their hunt for gene activity profiles in tumors that can help determine how susceptible the cancer will be to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion.

Gastrointestinal and renal responses to variable water intake in whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters
<p>Nectarivores face a constant challenge in terms of water balance, experiencing water loading or dehydration when switching between food plants or between feeding and fasting. To understand how whitebellied sunbirds and New Holland honeyeaters meet the challenges of varying preformed water load, we used the elimination of intramuscular-injected [<sup>14</sup>C]-<sc>l</sc>-glucose and <sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O to quantify intestinal and renal water handling on diets varying in sugar concentration. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters showed significant modulation of intestinal water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion, allowing excess water to be shunted through the intestine when on dilute diets. Despite reducing their fractional water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion, both species showed linear increases in water flux and fractional body water turnover as water intake increased (both afternoon and morning), suggesting that the modulation of fractional water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion was not sufficient to completely offset dietary water loads. In both species, glomerular filtration rate was independent of water gain (but was higher for the afternoon), as was renal fractional water re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion (measured in the afternoon). During the natural overnight fast, both sunbirds and honeyeaters arrested whole kidney function. Evaporative water loss in sunbirds was variable but correlated with water gain. Both sunbirds and honeyeaters appear to modulate intestinal water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion as an important component of water regulation to help deal with massive preformed water loads. Shutting down glomerular filtration rate during the overnight fast is another way of saving energy for osmoregulatory function. Birds maintain osmotic balance on diets varying markedly in preformed water load by varying both intestinal water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion and excretion through the intestine and kidneys.</p>

Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Older Women After Contemporary Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes are resistant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. However, cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation, a perturbation implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) and particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Radiotherapy for breast cancer results in variable cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure and may increase the risk of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a population-based case-control study of incident HF in 170 female residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (59 cases and 111 controls), who underwent contemporary (1998–2013) radiotherapy for breast cancer with computed tomography–assisted radiotherapy planning. Controls were matched to cases for age, tumor side, chemotherapy use, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Mean cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion dose (MCRD) in each patient was calculated from the patient’s computed tomography images and radiotherapy plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean age at radiotherapy was 69±9 years. Of HF cases, 38 (64%) had EF≥50% (HFpEF), 18 (31%) had EF<50% (HF with reduced EF), and 3 (5%) did not have EF measured. The EF was ≥40% in 50 of the 56 HF cases (89%) with an EF measurement. The mean interval from radiotherapy to HF was 5.8±3.4 years. The odds of HF was higher in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or atrial fibrillation. The MCRD was 2.5 Gy (range, 0.2–13.1 Gy) and higher in cases (3.3±2.7 Gy) than controls (2.1±2.0 Gy; <i>P</i>=0.004). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HF per log MCRD was 9.1 (3.4–24.4) for any HF, 16.9 (3.9–73.7) for HFpEF, and 3.17 (0.8–13.0) for HF with reduced EF. The increased odds of any HF or HFpEF with increasing MCRD remained significant after adjustment for HF risk factors and in sensitivity analyses matching by cancer stage rather than tumor side. Only 18.6% of patients experienced new or recurrent ischemic events between radiotherapy and the onset of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The relative risk of HFpEF increases with increasing cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure during contemporary conformal breast cancer radiotherapy. These data emphasize the importance of radiotherapy techniques that limit MCRD during breast cancer treatment. Moreover, these data provide further support for the importance of coronary microvascular compromise in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.</p></sec>

A <i>LIMA1</i> variant promotes low plasma LDL cholesterol and decreases intestinal cholesterol absorption
<p>A high concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although LDL-C levels vary among humans and are heritable, the genetic factors affecting LDL-C are not fully characterized. We identified a rare frameshift variant in the <i>LIMA1</i> (also known as <i>EPLIN</i> or <i>SREBP3</i>) gene from a Chinese family of Kazakh ethnicity with inherited low LDL-C and reduced cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion. In a mouse model, LIMA1 was mainly expressed in the small intestine and localized on the brush border membrane. LIMA1 bridged NPC1L1, an essential protein for cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion, to a transportation complex containing myosin Vb and facilitated cholesterol uptake. Similar to the human phenotype, <i>Lima1</i>-deficient mice displayed reduced cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion and were resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Through our study of both mice and humans, we identify LIMA1 as a key protein regulating intestinal cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion.</p>

The DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome controls radiation-induced cell death and tissue injury
<p>Acute exposure to ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion induces massive cell death and severe damage to tissues containing actively proliferating cells, including bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology remain controversial. Here, we show that mice deficient in the double-stranded DNA sensor AIM2 are protected from both subtotal body ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion–induced gastrointestinal syndrome and total body ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion–induced hematopoietic failure. AIM2 mediates the caspase-1–dependent death of intestinal epithelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to double-strand DNA breaks caused by ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion and chemotherapeutic agents. Mechanistically, we found that AIM2 senses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion-induced DNA damage in the nucleus to mediate inflammasome activation and cell death. Our results suggest that AIM2 may be a new therapeutic target for ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under visible and UV-B light. The mode of transcriptional regulation of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcription factors regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription and also posttranscriptionally modulate HY5 to control photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in visible and UV-B light signal transduction in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> expression is induced by UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and regulates its transcript levels. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive regulator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interaction studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> regulates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no evidence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interaction, and they primarily regulate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, BBX31 promotes the accumulation of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion by regulating genes involved in photoprotection and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner. Under UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, overexpression of <i>BBX31</i> enhances <i>HY5</i> transcriptional levels in a UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8-dependent manner, suggesting that BBX31 might regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong selection, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive selection. Positively selected genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying selection and more widespread positive selection in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions.</p>

Aerosol-driven droplet concentrations dominate coverage and water of oceanic low-level clouds
<p>A lack of reliable estimates of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) aerosols over oceans has severely limited our ability to quantify their effects on cloud properties and extent of cooling by reflecting solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion—a key uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. We introduce a methodology for ascribing cloud properties to CCN and isolating the aerosol effects from meteorological effects. Its application showed that for a given meteorology, CCN explains three-fourths of the variability in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling effect of clouds, mainly through affecting shallow cloud cover and water path. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of cloud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive forcing to CCN than previously reported, which means too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This suggests the existence of compensating aerosol warming effects yet to be discovered, possibly through deep clouds.</p>

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet
<p>Stellar heating causes atmospheres of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape. These extended atmospheres are difficult to observe because their main spectral signature—neutral hydrogen at ultraviolet wavelengths—is strongly absorbed by interstellar medium. We report the detection of the near-infrared triplet of neutral helium in the transiting warm Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-11b by using ground-based, high-resolution observations. The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion depth of 1.08 ± 0.05%. Interpreting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion spectra with three-dimensional simulations of the planet’s upper atmosphere suggests that it extends beyond 5 planetary radii, with a large-scale height and a helium mass loss rate of ≲3 × 10<sup>5</sup> grams per second.

These protons are lost to atmospheric neutrals and D-ring dust. Strong proton depletions that map onto features on the D-ring indicate a highly structured and diverse dust environment near Saturn.</p>

Rapid Pliocene adaptive radiation of modern kangaroos
<p>Differentiating between ancient and younger, more rapidly evolved clades is important for determining paleoenvironmental drivers of diversification. Australia possesses many aridity-adapted lineages, the origins of which have been closely linked to late Miocene continental aridification.

UV-B Inhibits Leaf Growth through Changes in Growth Regulating Factors and Gibberellin Levels
<p>Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion affects leaf growth in a wide range of species. In this work, we demonstrate that UV-B levels present in solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion inhibit maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf growth without causing any other visible stress symptoms, including the accumulation of DNA damage. We conducted kinematic analyses of cell division and expansion to understand the impact of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion on these cellular processes. Our results demonstrate that the decrease in leaf growth in UV-B-ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed leaves is a consequence of a reduction in cell production and a shortened growth zone (GZ). To determine the molecular pathways involved in UV-B inhibition of leaf growth, we performed RNA sequencing on isolated GZ tissues of control and UV-B-exposed plants. Our results show a link between the observed leaf growth inhibition and the expression of specific cell cycle and developmental genes, including growth-regulating factors (GRFs) and transcripts for proteins participating in different hormone pathways. Interestingly, the decrease in the GZ size correlates with a decrease in the concentration of GA19, the immediate precursor of the active gibberellin, GA1, by UV-B in this zone, which is regulated, at least in part, by the expression of GRF1 and possibly other transcription factors of the GRF family.</p>

Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies
<p>Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing the efficiency with which solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion is converted into biomass has recently become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) and irradiance was measured in five cultivars of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. This relationship differed substantially from that observed for conventional short term light response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. Genotypic variation in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective dissipation became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, estimated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

Tree Physiology
Root diameter variations explained by anatomy and phylogeny of 50 tropical and temperate tree species
<p>Root diameter, a critical indicator of root physiological function, varies greatly among tree species, but the underlying mechanism of this high variability is unclear. Here, we sampled 50 tree species across tropical and temperate zones in China, and measured root morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between root diameter, cortical thickness and stele diameter among tree species in tropical and temperate forests, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both root morphological and anatomical traits with divergence time during species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. The results showed that root diameter was strongly affected by cortical thickness but less by stele diameter in both tropical and temperate species. Changes in cortical thickness explained over 90% of variation in root diameter for the first order, and ∼74–87% for the second and third orders. Thicker roots displayed greater cortical thickness and more cortical cell layers than thinner roots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that root diameter, cortical thickness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with divergence time at the family level, showing similar variation trends in geological time. The results also suggested that trees tend to decrease their root cortical thickness rather than stele diameter during species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. The close linkage of variations in root morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 tree species should provide some insights into the mechanism of root diameter variability among tree species.</p>

Systematic Biology
Continental Diversification of an African Catfish Radiation (Mochokidae: <i>Synodontis</i>)
<p>Despite African rivers containing high species diversity, continental-scale studies investigating the mechanisms generating biological diversity of African riverine faunas are limited compared with lacustrine systems. To investigate the build-up of diversity in a tropical aquatic continental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, we test different models of lineage diversification and reconstruct the biogeographic history in a species-rich siluriform genus, <i>Synodontis</i> (~130 species), with a broad distribution across all major tropical African drainage basins. The resulting robust species-level phylogeny (~60% complete, based on a multigene data set) exhibits a near constant rate of lineage accumulation throughout the mid-Cenozoic to recent, irrespective of missing species and despite the changing environmental conditions that were prevalent during this time period. This pattern contrasts with the findings for species-level diversification of large clades that commonly show an early burst of cladogenesis followed by declining rates through time. The identification of distinct biogeographic clades demonstrates a correlation between river hydrology and cladogenesis, although there is evidence of recent repeat dispersal into the southern range of the focal group. We conclude that diverse freshwater fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions with tropical continental distributions represent important organisms to test hypotheses of diversification and investigate the effects of palaeo-landscapes and climates on present day biodiversity.

Radiation inhibits salivary gland function by promoting STIM1 cleavage by caspase-3 and loss of SOCE through a TRPM2-dependent pathway
<p>Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) is critical for salivary gland fluid secretion. We report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion treatment caused persistent salivary gland dysfunction by activating a TRPM2-dependent mitochondrial pathway, leading to caspase-3–mediated cleavage of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and loss of SOCE. After ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, acinar cells from the submandibular glands of <i>TRPM2</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup>, but not those from <i>TRPM2</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice, displayed an increase in the concentrations of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reactive oxygen species, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspase-3, which was associated with a sustained decrease in STIM1 abundance and attenuation of SOCE. In a salivary gland cell line, silencing the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter or caspase-3 or treatment with inhibitors of TRPM2 or caspase-3 prevented ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion-induced loss of STIM1 and SOCE. Expression of exogenous STIM1 in the salivary glands of ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed mice increased SOCE and fluid secretion. We suggest that targeting the mechanisms underlying the loss of STIM1 would be a potentially useful approach for preserving salivary gland function after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion therapy.</p>

Atomically dispersed Fe<sup>3+</sup> sites catalyze efficient CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction to CO
<p>Currently, the most active electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO are gold-based nanomaterials, whereas non–precious metal catalysts have shown low to modest activity. Here, we report a catalyst of dispersed single-atom iron sites that produces CO at an overpotential as low as 80 millivolts. Partial current density reaches 94 milliamperes per square centimeter at an overpotential of 340 millivolts. Operando x-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion spectroscopy revealed the active sites to be discrete Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions, coordinated to pyrrolic nitrogen (N) atoms of the N-doped carbon support, that maintain their +3 oxidation state during electrocatalysis, probably through electronic coupling to the conductive carbon support.

URI is required to maintain intestinal architecture during ionizing radiation
<p>Ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion (IR) can cause gastrointestinal syndrome (GIS), a lethal disorder, by means of unknown mechanisms. We show that high-dose ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion increases unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI) levels in mouse intestinal crypt, but organ regeneration correlates with URI reductions. URI overexpression in intestine protects mice from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion-induced GIS, whereas halving URI expression sensitizes mice to IR. URI specifically inhibits β-catenin in stem cell–like label-retaining (LR) cells, which are essential for organ regeneration after IR. URI reduction activates β-catenin–induced c-MYC expression, causing proliferation of and DNA damage to LR cells, rendering them radiosensitive. Therefore, URI labels LR cells which promote tissue regeneration in response to high-dose ir<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, and c-MYC inhibitors could be countermeasures for humans at risk of developing GIS.</p>

A key metabolic gene for recurrent freshwater colonization and radiation in fishes
<p>Colonization of new ecological niches has triggered large adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions. Although some lineages have made use of such opportunities, not all do so. The factors causing this variation among lineages are largely unknown. Here, we show that deficiency in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential ω-3 fatty acid, can constrain freshwater colonization by marine fishes. Our genomic analyses revealed multiple independent duplications of the fatty acid desaturase gene <i>Fads2</i> in stickleback lineages that subsequently colonized and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed in freshwater habitats, but not in close relatives that failed to colonize. Transgenic manipulation of <i>Fads2</i> in marine stickleback increased their ability to synthesize DHA and survive on DHA-deficient diets. Multiple freshwater ray-finned fishes also show a convergent increase in <i>Fads2</i> copies, indicating its key role in freshwater colonization.</p>

Dynamic gating of infrared radiation in a textile
<p>The human body absorbs and loses heat largely through infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion centering around a wavelength of 10 micrometers. However, neither our skin nor the textiles that make up clothing are capable of dynamically controlling this optical channel for thermal management. By coating triacetate-cellulose bimorph fibers with a thin layer of carbon nanotubes, we effectively modulated the infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion by more than 35% as the relative humidity of the underlying skin changed. Both experiments and modeling suggest that this dynamic infrared gating effect mainly arises from distance-dependent electromagnetic coupling between neighboring coated fibers in the textile yarns. This effect opens a pathway for developing wearable localized thermal management systems that are autonomous and self-powered, as well as expanding our ability to adapt to demanding environments.</p>

Hierarchically porous polymer coatings for highly efficient passive daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive daytime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling (PDRC) involves spontaneously cooling a surface by reflecting sunlight and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ing heat to the cold outer space. Current PDRC designs are promising alternatives to electrical cooling but are either inefficient or have limited applicability. We present a simple, inexpensive, and scalable phase inversion–based method for fabricating hierarchically porous poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) [P(VdF-HFP)<sub>HP</sub>] coatings with excellent PDRC capability. High, substrate-independent hemispherical solar reflectances (0.96 ± 0.03) and long-wave infrared emittances (0.97 ± 0.02) allow for subambient temperature drops of ~6°C and cooling powers of ~96 watts per square meter (W m<sup>−2</sup>) under solar intensities of 890 and 750 W m<sup>−2</sup>, respectively. The performance equals or surpasses those of state-of-the-art PDRC designs, and the technique offers a paint-like simplicity.</p>

The low-frequency source of Saturn’s kilometric radiation
<p>Understanding how auroral radio emissions are produced by magnetized bodies requires in situ measurements within their source region. Saturn’s kilometric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion (SKR) has been widely used as a remote proxy of Saturn’s magnetosphere. We present wave and plasma measurements from the Cassini spacecraft during its ring-grazing high-inclination orbits, which passed three times through the high-altitude SKR emission region. Northern dawn-side, narrow-banded radio sources were encountered at frequencies of 10 to 20 kilohertz, within regions of upward currents mapping to the ultraviolet auroral oval. The kilometric waves were produced on the extraordinary mode by the cyclotron maser instability from 6– to 12–kilo–electron volt electron beams and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ed quasi-perpendicularly to the auroral magnetic field lines.

Adaptive infrared-reflecting systems inspired by cephalopods
<p>Materials and systems that statically reflect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum underpin the performance of many entrenched technologies, including building insulation, energy-conserving windows, spacecraft components, electronics shielding, container packaging, protective clothing, and camouflage platforms.

By drawing inspiration from cephalopod skin, we developed adaptive infrared-reflecting platforms that feature a simple actuation mechanism, low working temperature, tunable spectral range, weak angular dependence, fast response, stability to repeated cycling, amenability to patterning and multiplexing, autonomous operation, robust mechanical properties, and straightforward manufacturability.

Observation of bulk Fermi arc and polarization half charge from paired exceptional points
<p>The ideas of topology have found tremendous success in closed physical systems, but even richer properties exist in the more general open or dissipative framework. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a bulk Fermi arc that develops from non-Hermitian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive losses in an open system of photonic crystal slabs. Moreover, we discover half-integer topological charges in the polarization of far-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion around the bulk Fermi arc. Both phenomena are shown to be direct consequences of the non-Hermitian topological properties of exceptional points, where resonances coincide in their frequencies and linewidths. Our work connects the fields of topological photonics, non-Hermitian physics, and singular optics, providing a framework to explore more complex non-Hermitian topological systems.</p>

We used this source to follow previously unexamined light-induced chemical reactions in the lowest electronic states of isolated CF<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and SF<sub>6</sub><sup>+</sup> molecules in the gas phase.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, diffuse light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under diffuse compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level diffuse light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed diffuse light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion profiles, we found that weaker penetration of diffuse versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under diffuse light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute diffuse and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how diffuse light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Large Numbers of Novel miRNAs Originate from DNA Transposons and Are Coincident with a Large Species Radiation in Bats
<p>Vesper bats (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a rapid adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion beginning around 36 Ma that resulted in the second most species-rich mammalian family (>400 species). Coincident with that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion was an initial burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present in some species. Such extensive and recent DNA transposon activity has not been seen in any other extant mammal. Indeed, retrotransposon activity is much more common in all other sequenced mammal genomes. Deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction from a vespertilionid bat, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, as well as a dog and horse revealed large numbers of 17–24 bp putative miRNAs (p/miRNAs). Although the origination rate of p/miRNAs is similar in all three taxa, 61.1% of postdivergence p/miRNAs in <i>Eptesicus</i> are derived from transposable elements (TEs) compared with only 23.9% and 16.5% in the dog and horse, respectively. Not surprisingly, given the retrotransposon bias of dog and horse, the majority of TE-derived p/miRNAs are associated with retrotransposons. In <i>Eptesicus</i>, however, 58.7% of the TE-derived and 35.9% of the total p/miRNAs arose not from retrotransposons but from bat-specific DNA transposons. Notably, we observe that the timing of the DNA transposon expansion and the resulting introduction of novel p/miRNAs coincide with the rapid diversification of the family Vespertilionidae. Furthermore, potential targets of the DNA transposon-derived p/miRNAs are identifiable and enriched for genes that are important for regulation of transcription. We propose that lineage-specific DNA transposon activity lead to the rapid and repeated introduction of novel p/miRNAs. Some of these p/miRNAs are likely functional miRNAs and potentially influenced the diversification of Vespertilionidae. Our observations suggest a mechanism for introducing functional genomic variation rapidly through the expansion of DNA transposons that fits within the TE-thrust hypothesis.</p>

These were scanned using   an ultra-low-dose CT Reduced Effective Dose Using Computed Tomography   In Orthopaedic Injury (REDUCTION) protocol. Studies from 16 selected   cases were compared with 16 C-CT scans matched for age, gender and   type of fracture. Studies were assessed for diagnosis and image   quality. Descriptive and reliability statistics were calculated.   The total effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion dose for each scanned site was compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean estimated effective dose (ED) for the REDUCTION protocol   was 0.03 milliSieverts (mSv) and 0.43 mSv (p < 0.005) for C-CT.   The sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value   (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the REDUCTION protocol   to detect fractures were 0.98, 0.89, 0.98 and 0.89 respectively   when two occult fractures were excluded. Inter- and intra-observer   reliability for diagnosis using the REDUCTION protocol (κ = 0.75, κ =   0.71) were similar to those of C-CT (κ = 0.85, κ = 0.82). Using   the REDUCTION protocol, 3D CT reconstructions were equivalent in   quality and diagnostic information to those generated by C-CT (κ =   0.87, κ = 0.94).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>With a near 14-fold reduction in estimated ED compared with C-CT,   the REDUCTION protocol reduces the amount of CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion substantially   without significant diagnostic decay. It produces images that appear   to be comparable with those of C-CT for evaluating fractures of   the limbs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1668-73.</p></sec>

Stroma provides an intestinal stem cell niche in the absence of epithelial Wnts
<p>Wnt/β-catenin signaling supports intestinal homeostasis by regulating proliferation in the crypt. Multiple Wnts are expressed in Paneth cells as well as other intestinal epithelial and stromal cells. <i>Ex vivo</i>, Wnts secreted by Paneth cells can support intestinal stem cells when Wnt signaling is enhanced with supplemental R-Spondin 1 (RSPO1). However, <i>in vivo</i>, the source of Wnts in the stem cell niche is less clear. Genetic ablation of <i>Porcn</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum resident O-acyltransferase that is essential for the secretion and activity of all vertebrate Wnts, confirmed the role of intestinal epithelial Wnts in <i>ex vivo</i> culture. Unexpectedly, mice lacking epithelial Wnt activity (<i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup>/Villin-Cre</i> mice) had normal intestinal proliferation and differentiation, as well as successful regeneration after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion injury, indicating that epithelial Wnts are dispensable for these processes. Consistent with a key role for stroma in the crypt niche, intestinal stromal cells endogenously expressing Wnts and <i>Rspo3</i> support the growth of <i>Porcn<sup>Del</sup></i> organoids <i>ex vivo</i> without RSPO1 supplementation. Conversely, increasing pharmacologic PORCN inhibition, affecting both stroma and epithelium, reduced <i>Lgr5</i> intestinal stem cells, inhibited recovery from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion injury, and at the highest dose fully blocked intestinal proliferation. We conclude that epithelial Wnts are dispensable and that stromal production of Wnts can fully support normal murine intestinal homeostasis.</p>

Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation From Cardiac Procedures and Malignancy Risk in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) are exposed to increasing amounts of low-dose ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. Cancer prevalence in this population is higher than in the general population. This study estimates the association between LDIR exposure from cardiac procedures and incident cancer in adult patients with CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population derived from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database. We measured cumulative numbers of LDIR-related cardiac procedures for each patient until 1 year before the time of cancer diagnosis or administrative censoring. To assess the association between LDIR exposure and cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study and matched cancer cases with controls on sex, CHD severity, birth year, and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study included 24 833 adult patients with CHD aged 18 to 64 years from 1995 to 2009. In >250 791 person-years of follow-up, 602 cancer cases were observed (median age, 55.4 years). The cumulative incidence of cancer estimated up to 64 years of age was 15.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.2–16.5). Cases had more LDIR-related cardiac procedures than controls (1410 versus 921 per 1000 adult patients with CHD, <i>P</i><0.0001). Cumulative LDIR exposure was independently associated with cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13). Similar results were obtained by using dose estimates for LDIR exposure (OR, 1.10 per 10 mSv; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15) with a possible dose-related response. The effect measure was in the same direction, and the association was persistent for exposure from ≥6 procedures in all sensitivity analyses: after excluding most smoking-related cancer cases (OR, 1.10 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.05–1.16 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.77–5.37), and after applying a 3-year lag period (OR, 1.09 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.03–1.14 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures: 2.58; 95% CI, 1.43–4.69).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based study to analyze and document the association between LDIR-related cardiac procedures and incident cancer in the population of adults with CHD. Confirmations of these findings by prospective studies are needed to reinforce policy recommendations for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion surveillance in patients with CHD where no regulation currently exists. Physicians ordering and performing cardiac imaging should ensure that exposure is as low as reasonably achievable without sacrificing quality of care.</p></sec>

Broadband 2D Electronic Spectroscopy Reveals a Carotenoid Dark State in Purple Bacteria
<sec><title>A Light in the Dark</title><p>Carotenoids enhance the efficiency of photosynthesis by absorbing light at wavelengths inaccessible to chlorophyll. However, the mechanism underlying transfer of the absorbed energy from these pigments to the site of chemical catalysis is unclear. Studies have debated the involvement of a “dark” state in the carotenoid electronic structure—a state inaccessible by direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion populated by partial relaxation of the initial excited state. <bold>Ostroumov <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 52) used two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to provide evidence of this state.</p></sec>

RSL Class II Transcription Factors Guide the Nuclear Localization of RHL1 to Regulate Root Hair Development
<p>Root hairs are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion of nutrients and water from the rhizosphere. The Root Hair Defective-Six Like (RSL) Class II family of transcription factors is expressed preferentially in root hairs and has a conserved role in root hair development in land plants. We functionally characterized the seven members of the RSL Class II subfamily in the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genome. In root hairs, six of these genes were preferentially expressed and four were strongly expressed. Phenotypic analysis of each mutant revealed that <i>Os07g39940</i> plays a major role in root hair formation, based on observations of a short root hair phenotype in those mutants. Overexpression (OX) for each of four family members in rice resulted in an increase in the density and length of root hairs. These four members contain a transcription activation domain and are targeted to the nucleus. They interact with rice Root Hairless1 (OsRHL1), a key regulator of root hair development. When heterologously expressed in epidermal cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves, OsRHL1 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. When coexpressed with each of the four RSL Class II members, however, OsRLH1 was translocated to the nucleus. Transcriptome analysis using <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants revealed that 86 genes, including Class III peroxidases, were highly up-regulated. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species levels in the root hairs were increased in <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants but were drastically reduced in the <i>os07g39940</i> and <i>rhl1</i> mutants. Our results demonstrate that RSL Class II members function as essential regulators of root hair development in rice.</p>

ONE-HELIX PROTEIN2 (OHP2) Is Required for the Stability of OHP1 and Assembly Factor HCF244 and Is Functionally Linked to PSII Biogenesis
<p>The members of the light-harvesting complex protein family, which include the one-helix proteins (OHPs), are characterized by one to four membrane-spanning helices. These proteins function in light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion and energy dissipation, sensing light intensity, and triggering photomorphogenesis or the binding of chlorophyll and intermediates of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains two OHPs, while four homologs (named high-light-induced proteins) exist in <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC6803. Various functions have been assigned to high-light-induced proteins, ranging from photoprotection and the assembly of photosystem I (PSI) and PSII to regulation of the early steps of chlorophyll biosynthesis, but little is known about the function of the two plant OHPs. Here, we show that the two Arabidopsis OHPs form heterodimers and that the stromal part of OHP2 interacts with the plastid-localized PSII assembly factor HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244). Moreover, concurrent accumulation of the two OHPs and HCF244 is critical for the stability of all three proteins. In particular, the absence of OHP2 leads to the complete loss of OHP1 and HCF244. We used a virus-induced gene silencing approach to minimize the expression of <i>OHP1</i> or <i>OHP2</i> in adult Arabidopsis plants and revealed that OHP2 is essential for the accumulation of the PSII core subunits, while the other photosynthetic complexes and the major light-harvesting complex proteins remained unaffected. We examined the potential functions of the OHP1-OHP2-HCF244 complex in the assembly and/or repair of PSII and propose a role for this heterotrimeric complex in thylakoid membrane biogenesis.</p>

Soft X-Ray Imaging of Cellular Carbon and Nitrogen Distributions in Heterocystous Cyanobacteria
<p>Soft x-ray microscopy (SXM) is a minimally invasive technique for single-cell high-resolution imaging as well as the visualization of intracellular distributions of light elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We used SXM to observe photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in the filamentous cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120, which can form heterocysts during nitrogen starvation. Statistical and spectroscopic analyses from SXM images around the K-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion edge of nitrogen revealed a significant difference in the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio between vegetative cells and heterocysts. Application of this analysis to soft x-ray images of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 revealed inhomogenous C/N ratios in the cells. Furthermore, soft x-ray tomography of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 revealed differing cellular C/N ratios, indicating different carbon and nitrogen distributions between vegetative cells and heterocysts in three dimensions.</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy photosynthesis in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy photosynthesis. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale photosynthesis to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy photosynthesis through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy photosynthesis should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy photosynthesis can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase photosynthesis arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorpt</span></strong>ion profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

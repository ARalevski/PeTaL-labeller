Catalytic reductive [4 + 1]-cycloadditions of vinylidenes and dienes
<p>Cycloaddition reactions provide direct and convergent routes to cycloalkanes, making them valuable targets for the development of synthetic methods. Whereas six-membered rings are readily accessible from Diels-Alder reactions, cycloadditions that generate five-membered rings are comparatively limited in scope. Here, we report that dinickel complexes catalyze [4 + 1]-cycloaddition reactions of 1,3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dien</span></strong>es. The C<sub>1</sub> partner is a vinylidene equivalent generated from the reductive activation of a 1,1-dichloroalkene in the presence of stoichiometric zinc. Intermolecular and intramolecular variants of the reaction are described, and high levels of asymmetric induction are achieved in the intramolecular cycloadditions using a <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>-symmetric chiral ligand that stabilizes a metal-metal bond.</p>

Catalytic palladium-oxyallyl cycloaddition
<p>Exploration of intermediates that enable chemoselective cycloaddition reactions and expeditious construction of fused- or bridged-ring systems is a continuous challenge for organic synthesis. As an intermediate of interest, the oxyallyl cation has been harnessed to synthesize architectures containing seven-membered rings via (4+3) cycloaddition. However, its potential to access five-membered skeletons is underdeveloped, largely due to the thermally forbidden (3+2) pathway. Here, the combination of a tailored precursor and a Pd(0) catalyst generates a Pd-oxyallyl intermediate that cyclizes with conjugated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dien</span></strong>es to produce a diverse array of tetrahydrofuran skeletons. The cycloaddition overrides conventional (4+3) selectivity by proceeding through a stepwise pathway involving a Pd-allyl transfer and ring closure sequence. Subsequent treatment of the (3+2) adducts with a palladium catalyst converts the heterocycles to the carbocyclic cyclopentanones.</p>

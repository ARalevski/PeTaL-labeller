Multivalent counterions diminish the lubricity of polyelectrolyte brushes
<p>Polyelectrolyte brushes provide wear protection and lubrication in many technical, medical, physiological, and biological applications. Wear resistance and low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">friction</span></strong> are attributed to counterion osmotic pressure and the hydration layer surrounding the charged polymer segments. However, the presence of multivalent counterions in solution can strongly affect the interchain interactions and structural properties of brush layers. We evaluated the lubrication properties of polystyrene sulfonate brush layers sliding against each other in aqueous solutions containing increasing concentrations of counterions. The presence of multivalent ions (Y<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>), even at minute concentrations, markedly increases the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">friction</span></strong> forces between brush layers owing to electrostatic bridging and brush collapse. Our results suggest that the lubricating properties of polyelectrolyte brushes in multivalent solution are hindered relative to those in monovalent solution.</p>

Fluid-induced aseismic fault slip outpaces pore-fluid migration
<p>Earthquake swarms attributed to subsurface fluid injection are usually assumed to occur on faults destabilized by increased pore-fluid pressures. However, fluid injection could also activate aseismic slip, which might outpace pore-fluid migration and transmit earthquake-triggering stress changes beyond the fluid-pressurized region. We tested this theoretical prediction against data derived from fluid-injection experiments that activated and measured slow, aseismic slip on preexisting, shallow faults. We found that the pore pressure and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">friction</span></strong> coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Using a coupled shear-rupture model, we derived constraints on the hydromechanical parameters of the actively deforming fault. The inferred aseismic rupture front propagates faster and to larger distances than the diffusion of pressurized pore fluid.</p>

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation
<p>Wind and solar farms offer a major pathway to clean, renewable energies. However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended climate consequences. In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic vegetation to show that large-scale installations of wind and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold precipitation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">friction</span></strong> and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in vegetation further enhances precipitation, creating a positive albedo–precipitation–vegetation feedback that contributes ~80% of the precipitation increase for wind farms. This local enhancement is scale dependent and is particular to the Sahara, with small impacts in other deserts.</p>

Friction at the bed does not control fast glacier flow
<p>The largest uncertainty in the ice sheet models used to predict future sea level rise originates from our limited understanding of processes at the ice/bed interface. Near glacier termini, where basal sliding controls ice flow, most predictive ice sheet models use a parameterization of sliding that has been theoretically derived for glacier flow over a hard bed. We find that this sliding relation does not apply to the 140 Greenland glaciers that we analyzed. There is no relationship between basal sliding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">friction</span></strong>al stress at the glacier bed, contrary to theoretical predictions. There is a strong relationship between sliding speed and net pressure at the glacier bed. This latter finding is in agreement with earlier observations of mountain glaciers that have been largely overlooked by the glaciological community.</p>

The incidence of nerve root injury by high-speed drill can be reduced by chilled saline irrigation in a rabbit model
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We aimed to evaluate the temperature around the nerve root during drilling of the lamina and to   determine whether irrigation during drilling can reduce the chance of nerve root injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Lumbar nerve roots were exposed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">friction</span></strong>al heat by high-speed drilling of the lamina in a live   rabbit model, with saline (room temperature (RT) or chilled saline) or without saline (control)   irrigation. We measured temperatures surrounding the nerve root and made histological   evaluations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the control group, the mean temperature around the nerve root was 52.0°C (38.0°C to   75.5°C) after 60 seconds of drilling, and nerve root injuries were found in one out of 13   (7.7%) immediately, three out of 14 (21.4%) at three days, and 11 out of 25 (44.0%) at seven days   post-operatively. While the RT group showed a significantly lower temperature around the nerve root   compared with the control group (mean 46.5°C; 34.5°C to 66.9°C, p < 0.001), RT   saline failed to significantly reduce the incidence of nerve root injury (ten out of 26; 38.5%; odds   ratio (OR) 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.516 to 1.785; p = 0.563). However, chilled saline   irrigation resulted in a significantly lower temperature than the control group (mean 39.0°C;   35.3°C to 52.3°C; p < 0.001) and a lower rate of nerve root injury (two out of 21;   9.5%, OR 0.13; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.703, p = 0.010).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">friction</span></strong>al heat caused by a high-speed drill can cause histological nerve root injury.

Instability of the hip after anatomical  re-alignment in patients with a slipped capital femoral epiphysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Several studies have reported the safety and efficacy of subcapital   re-alignment for patients with slipped capital femoral epiphysis   (SCFE) using surgical dislocation of the hip and an extended retinacular   flap. Instability of the hip and dislocation as a consequence of   this surgery has only recently gained attention. We discuss this   problem with some illustrative cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We explored the literature on the possible pathophysiological   causes and surgical steps associated with the risk of post-operative   instability and articular damage. In addition, we describe supplementary   steps that could be used to avoid these problems.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The causes of instability may be divided into three main groups:   the first includes causes directly related to SCFE (acetabular labral   damage, severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abras</span></strong>ion of the acetabular cartilage, flattening   of the acetabular roof and a bell-shaped deformity of the epiphysis);   the second, causes not related to the SCFE (acetabular orientation   and poor quality of the soft tissues); the third, causes directly   related to the surgery (capsulotomy, division of the ligamentum teres,   shortening of the femoral neck, pelvi-trochanteric impingement,   previous proximal femoral osteotomy and post-operative positioning   of the leg).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present examples drawn from our clinical practice, as well   as possible ways of reducing the risks of these complications, and   of correcting them if they happen.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:16–21.</p></sec>

Metallosis following implantation of magnetically controlled growing rods in the treatment of scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present a case series of five patients who had revision surgery   following magnetic controlled growing rods (MGCR) for early onset   scoliosis. Metallosis was found during revision in four out of five   patients and we postulated a mechanism for rod failure based on   retrieval analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Retrieval analysis was performed on the seven explanted rods.   The mean duration of MCGR from implantation to revision was 35 months   (17 to 46). The mean age at revision was 12 years (7 to 15; four   boys, one girl).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of six out of seven rods had tissue metallosis and pseudo-capsule   surrounding the actuator. A total of four out of seven rods were   pistoning. There were two rods which were broken. All rods had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abras</span></strong>ive   circumferential markings. A significant amount of metal debris was   found when the actuators were carefully cut open. Analytical electron   microscopy demonstrated metal fragments of predominantly titanium   with a mean particle size of 3.36 microns (1.31 to 6.61).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study highlights concerns with tissue metallosis in MCGR.

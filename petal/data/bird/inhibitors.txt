A Violaxanthin Deepoxidase Interacts with a Viral Suppressor of RNA Silencing to Inhibit Virus Amplification
<p>RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing plays a critical role against viral infection. To counteract this antiviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing, viruses have evolved various RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s. Meanwhile, plants have evolved counter-counter defense strategies against RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing suppression (RSS). In this study, the violaxanthin deepoxidase protein of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), ZmVDE, was shown to interact specifically with the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro; a viral RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>) of <i>Sugarcane mosaic virus</i> (SCMV) via its mature protein region by yeast two-hybrid assay, which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells. It was demonstrated that amino acids 101 to 460 in HC-Pro and the amino acid glutamine-292 in ZmVDE mature protein were essential for this interaction. The mRNA levels of <i>ZmVDE</i> were down-regulated 75% to 65% at an early stage of SCMV infection. Interestingly, ZmVDE, which normally localized in the chloroplasts and cytoplasm, could relocalize to HC-Pro-containing aggregate bodies in the presence of HC-Pro alone or SCMV infection. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, ZmVDE could attenuate the RSS activity of HC-Pro in a specific protein interaction-dependent manner. Subsequently, transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of the <i>ZmVDE</i> gene facilitated SCMV RNA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> protein accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that ZmVDE interacts with SCMV HC-Pro and attenuates its RSS activity, contributing to decreased SCMV accumulation. This study demonstrates that a host factor can be involved in secondary defense responses against viral infection in monocot plants.</p>

Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial component fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s of RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing induce developmental defects similar to those caused by mutations in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>-mediated developmental defects to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental defects in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> mutation. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>-mediated developmental defects, using two independent <i>arf8</i> mutations and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F1 generation, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the phenotype in the F2 generation. However, the loss of phenotype in the F2 generation was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent loss-of-function point mutation, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 generations. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental defects caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

Target RNA Secondary Structure Is a Major Determinant of miR159 Efficacy
<p>In plants, microRNA (miRNA)-target complementarity has long been considered the predominant factor determining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing outcome of the miRNA-target interaction, although the efficacy of such interactions have rarely been appraised in plants. Here, we perform in planta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing efficacy assays on seven Arabidopsis <i>MYB</i> genes, all of which contain conserved miR159-binding sites of analogous complementarity. These genes were found to be differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed by miR159; <i>MYB81</i>, <i>MYB97</i>, <i>MYB101</i>, <i>MYB104</i>, and <i>DUO1</i> were all poorly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed, whereas <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed. Curiously, this is consistent with previous genetic analysis defining <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> as the major functional targets of miR159. Neither the free energy of miR159-target complementarity, nor miRNA binding site accessibility, as determined by flanking region AU content, could fully explain the discrepancy of miR159 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing efficacy. Instead, we found that <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were both predicted to contain a distinctive RNA secondary structure abutting the miR159 binding site. The structure is composed of two stem-loops (SLs) that are predicted to form in <i>MYB33</i>/65 homologs of species as evolutionary distant as gymnosperms. Functional analysis found that the RNA structure in <i>MYB33</i> correlated with strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing efficacy; introducing mutations to disrupt either SL attenuated miR159 efficacy, while introducing complementary mutations to restore the SLs, but not the sequence, restored strong miR159-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing. Therefore, it appears that this RNA secondary structure demarcates <i>MYB33</i>/<i>65</i> as sensitive targets of miR159, which underpins the narrow functional specificity of Arabidopsis miR159.</p>

Fitness Trade-Offs Lead to Suppressor Tolerance in Yeast
<p>Genetic variation among individuals within a population provides the raw material for phenotypic diversity upon which natural selection operates. Some given variants can act on multiple standing genomic variations simultaneously and release previously inaccessible phenotypes, leading to increased adaptive potential upon challenging environments. Previously, we identified such a variant related to a tRNA nonsense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> in yeast. When introduced into other genetic backgrounds, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> led to an increased population phenotypic variance on various culture conditions, conferring background and environment specific selective advantages. Nonetheless, most isolates are intolerant to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> on rich media due to a severe fitness cost. Here, we found that the tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> is related to a surprising level of fitness outburst, showing a trade-off effect to accommodate the cost of carrying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>. To dissect the genetic basis of such trade-offs, we crossed strains with contrasting tolerance levels on rich media, and analyzed the fitness distribution patterns in the offspring. Combining quantitative tetrad analysis and bulk segregant analysis, we identified two genes, namely <i>MKT1</i> and <i>RGA1</i>, involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance. We showed that alleles from the tolerant parent for both genes conferred a significant gain of fitness, which increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance. Our results present a detailed dissection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance in yeast and provide insights into the molecular basis of trade-offs between fitness and evolutionary potential.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the â€˜protection hypothesisâ€™. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2Ã—2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

Trans-inhibition of activation and proliferation signals by Fc receptors in mast cells and basophils
<p>Allergic and autoimmune inflammation are associated with the activation of mast cells and basophils by antibodies against allergens or auto-antigens, respectively. Both cell types express several receptors for the Fc portion of antibodies, the engagement of which by antigen-antibody complexes controls their responses. When aggregated on the plasma membrane, high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptors (FcÎµRI) and low-affinity IgG receptors (FcÎ³RIIIA in mice, FcÎ³RIIA in humans) induce these cells to release and secrete proinflammatory mediators, chemokines, and cytokines that account for clinical symptoms. When coaggregated with activating receptors on the same cells, other low-affinity IgG receptors (FcÎ³RIIB in both species) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong> mast cell and basophil activation. We found that FcÎ³RIIB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed not only signals triggered by activating receptors with which they were coengaged (cis-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion), but also signals triggered by receptors engaged independently (trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion). Trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion acted upon the FcÎµRI-dependent activation of mouse mast cells, mouse basophils, and human basophils, and upon growth factor receptor (Kit)â€“dependent normal mouse mast cell proliferation, as well as the constitutive in vitro proliferation and the in vivo growth of oncogene (v-Abl)â€“transformed mastocytoma cells. Trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion was induced by receptors, whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ory (FcÎ³RIIB) or activating (FcÎµRI), which recruited the lipid phosphatase SHIP1. By hydrolyzing PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, SHIP1 induced a global unresponsiveness that affected biological responses triggered by receptors that use phosphoinositide 3-kinase to signal. These data suggest that trans-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion controls numerous physiological and pathological processes, and that it may be used as a therapeutic tool in inflammation, especially but not exclusively, in allergy and autoimmunity.</p>

Distinct phases of Polycomb silencing to hold epigenetic memory of cold in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing by Polycomb complexes is central to eukaryotic development. Cold-induced epigenetic repression of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>) in the plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> provides an opportunity to study initiation and maintenance of Polycomb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing. Here, we show that a subset of Polycomb repressive complex 2 factors nucleate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing in a small region within <i>FLC</i>, locally increasing H3K27me3 levels. This nucleation confers a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed state that is metastably inherited, with memory held in the local chromatin. Metastable memory is then converted to stable epigenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing through separate Polycomb factors, which spread across the locus after cold to enlarge the domain that contains H3K27me3. Polycomb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing at <i>FLC</i> thus has mechanistically distinct phases, which involve specialization of distinct Polycomb components to deliver first metastable then long-term epigenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing.</p>

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants
<p>Non-cell autonomous RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing can spread from cell to cell and over long distances in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing are poorly understood. Here, we identified a <i>DICER-LIKE2</i> (<i>DCL2</i>)<i>-</i>dependent mechanism for systemic spread of posttranscriptional RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing, also known as posttranscriptional gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing (PTGS), in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Using a suite of transgenic <i>DCL</i> RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that <i>N. benthamiana</i> DCL1, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22, 24, and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of <i>DCL2</i> expression reduced the spread of gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing, while suppression of <i>DCL3</i> or <i>DCL4</i> expression enhanced systemic PTGS. In contrast to <i>DCL4</i> RNAi lines, <i>DCL2</i>-<i>DCL4</i> double-RNAi lines developed systemic PTGS similar to that observed in <i>DCL2</i> RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that <i>DCL2</i> was required in the scion to respond to the signal, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated <i>DCL</i> genetic pathway in which <i>DCL2</i> plays an essential role in systemic PTGS in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, while both <i>DCL4</i> and <i>DCL3</i> attenuate systemic PTGS. We discuss the potential role of 21, 22, and 24 nt siRNAs in systemic PTGS.</p>

An Improved <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS
<p>Virus-induced gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing (VIGS) is used extensively for gene function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing conducted through stable transformation, but many virus-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing vectors, especially in grasses, induce only transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing phenotypes. A major reason for transient phenotypes is the instability of the foreign gene fragment (insert) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the development of a <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> (BMV)-based vector that better maintains inserts through modification of the original BMV vector RNA sequence. Modification of the BMV RNA3 sequence yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained <i>phytoene desaturase</i> and <i>heat shock protein70-1</i> (<i>HSP70-1</i>) inserts in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Longer maintenance of inserts was correlated with greater target gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing and more extensive visible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing phenotypes displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more leaves. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in <i>N. benthamiana</i> after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of virus in this intermediate host used to produce virus inoculum for grass hosts. For <i>HSP70</i>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target gene knockdown and not a general effect of virus infection. The cause of the increased insert stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in grasses, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root growth and development in response to environmental stresses through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of root growth response to Al stress is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al stress in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion under Al stress was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al stress were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al stress. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al stress was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion is regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion in response to Al stress.</p>

The kinases HipA and HipA7 phosphorylate different substrate pools in <i>Escherichia coli</i> to promote multidrug tolerance
<p>The bacterial serine-threonine protein kinase HipA promotes multidrug tolerance by phosphorylating the glutamate-tRNA ligase (GltX), leading to a halt in translation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of growth, and induction of a physiologically dormant state (persistence). The HipA variant HipA7 substantially increases persistence despite being less efficient at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing cell growth. We postulated that this phenotypic difference was caused by differences in the substrates targeted by both kinases. We overproduced HipA and HipA7 in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and identified their endogenous substrates by SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomics. We confirmed that GltX was the main substrate of both kinase variants and likely the primary determinant of persistence. When HipA and HipA7 were moderately overproduced from plasmids, HipA7 targeted only GltX, but HipA phosphorylated several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional substrates involved in translation, transcription, and replication, such as ribosomal protein L11 (RplK) and the negative modulator of replication initiation, SeqA. HipA7 showed reduced kinase activity compared to HipA and targeted a substrate pool similar to that of HipA only when produced from a highâ€“copy number plasmid. The kinase variants also differed in autophosphorylation, which was substantially reduced for HipA7. When produced endogenously from the chromosome, HipA showed no activity because of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion by the antitoxin HipB, whereas HipA7 phosphorylated GltX and phage shock protein PspA.

Targeting nucleotide exchange to inhibit constitutively active G protein Î± subunits in cancer cells
<p>Constitutively active G protein Î± subunits cause cancer, cholera, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and other disorders. Therapeutic intervention by targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of constitutively active GÎ± subunits in these disorders has yet to be achieved. We found that constitutively active GÎ±<sub>q</sub> in uveal melanoma (UM) cells was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed by the cyclic depsipeptide FR900359 (FR). FR allosterically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed guanosine diphosphateâ€“forâ€“guanosine triphosphate (GDP/GTP) exchange to trap constitutively active GÎ±<sub>q</sub> in inactive, GDP-bound GÎ±Î²Î³ heterotrimers. Allosteric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of other GÎ± subunits was achieved by the introduction of an FR-binding site. In UM cells driven by constitutively active GÎ±<sub>q</sub>, FR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed second messenger signaling, arrested cell proliferation, reinstated melanocytic differentiation, and stimulated apoptosis. In contrast, FR had no effect on <i>BRAF</i>-driven UM cells. FR promoted UM cell differentiation by reactivating polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)â€“mediated gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing, a heretofore unrecognized effector system of constitutively active GÎ±<sub>q</sub> in UM. Constitutively active GÎ±<sub>q</sub> and PRC2 therefore provide therapeutic targets for UM. The development of FR analogs specific for other GÎ± subunit subtypes may provide novel therapeutic approaches for diseases driven by constitutively active GÎ± subunits or multiple G proteinâ€“coupled receptors (GPCRs) where targeting a single receptor is ineffective.</p>

Reduced abundance of the E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP contributes to decreased expression of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus in nonâ€“small cell lung cancer
<p>The tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, one protein encoded by the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus, is frequently absent in multiple cancers, including nonâ€“small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Whereas increased methylation of the encoding gene (<i>CDKN2A</i>) accounts for its loss in a third of patients, no molecular explanation exists for the remainder. We unraveled an alternative mechanism for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus involving the E3 ubiquitin ligase and transcriptional cofactor E6AP (also known as UBE3A). We found that the expression of three tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> genes encoded in the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus (<i>p15</i><sup><i>INK4b</i></sup>, <i>p16</i><sup><i>INK4a</i></sup>, and <i>p19</i><sup><i>ARF</i></sup>) was decreased in <i>E6AP</i><sup><i>âˆ’/âˆ’</i></sup> mouse embryo fibroblasts. E6AP induced the expression of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus at the transcriptional level by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing <i>CDC6</i> transcription, a gene encoding a key repressor of the locus. Luciferase assays revealed that E6AP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed <i>CDC6</i> expression by reducing its E2F1-dependent transcription. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that E6AP reduced the amount of E2F1 at the <i>CDC6</i> promoter. In a subset of NSCLC samples, an E6AP-low/CDC6-high/p16<sup>INK4a</sup>-low protein abundance profile correlated with low methylation of the gene encoding p16<sup>INK4a</sup> (<i>CDKN2A</i>) and poor patient prognosis. These findings define a previously unrecognized tumor-suppressive role for E6AP in NSCLC, reveal an alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing mechanism of the <i>INK4/ARF</i> locus, and reveal E6AP as a potential prognostic marker in NSCLC.</p>

Laser cooling of ions in a neutral plasma
<p>Laser cooling of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> plasma is a challenging task because of the high temperatures typically associated with the plasma state.

Engineering Artificial MicroRNAs for Multiplex Gene Silencing and Simplified Transgenic Screen

However, obtaining transgenic plants with maximal gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing remains a major technical challenge in current amiRNA applications.

The MAPK Kinase Kinase GmMEKK1 Regulates Cell Death and Defense Responses
<p>MAPK signaling pathways play critical roles in plant immunity. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed multiple genes encoding MAPKs using virus-induced gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing mediated by <i>Bean pod mottle virus</i> to identify MAPK genes involved in soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) immunity. Surprisingly, a strong hypersensitive response (HR) cell death was observed when soybean <i>MAPK KINASE KINASE1</i> (<i>GmMEKK1</i>), a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>MEKK1</i>, was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed. The HR was accompanied by the overaccumulation of defense signaling molecules, salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide. Genes involved in primary metabolism, translation/transcription, photosynthesis, and growth/development were down-regulated in <i>GmMEKK1-</i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants, while the expression of defense-related genes was activated. Accordingly, <i>GmMEKK1</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants were more resistant to downy mildew (<i>Peronospora manshurica</i>) and <i>Soybean mosaic virus</i> compared with control plants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing <i>GmMEKK1</i> reduced the activation of GmMPK6 but enhanced the activation of <i>Gm</i>MPK3 in response to flg22 peptide. Unlike Arabidopsis MPK4, <i>Gm</i>MPK4 was not activated by either flg22 or SA. Interestingly, transient overexpression of <i>GmMEKK1</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> also induced HR. Our results indicate that <i>Gm</i>MEKK1 plays both positive and negative roles in immunity and appears to differentially activate downstream MPKs by promoting <i>Gm</i>MPK6 activation but suppressing GmMPK3 activation in response to flg22. The involvement of <i>Gm</i>MPK4 kinase activity in cell death and in flg22- or SA-triggered defense responses in soybean requires further investigation.</p>

The Tomato Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase SlMPK1 Is as a Negative Regulator of the High-Temperature Stress Response
<p>High-temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits plant growth and development. MAPK cascades play key roles in plant growth and stress signaling, but their involvement in the HT stress response is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 47-kD MBP-phosphorylated protein (p47-MBPK) activated in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves under HT and identify it as SlMPK1 by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of <i>SlMPK1</i> in transgenic tomato plants resulted in enhanced tolerance to HT, while overexpression resulted in reduced tolerance. Proteomic analysis identified a set of proteins involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant defense that are significantly more abundant in RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants than nontransgenic plants under HT stress. RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants also showed changes in membrane lipid peroxidation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant enzyme activities. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a serine-proline-rich protein homolog, SlSPRH1, which interacts with SlMPK1 in yeast, in plant cells, and in vitro. We demonstrate that SlMPK1 can directly phosphorylate SlSPRH1. Furthermore, the serine residue serine-44 of SlSPRH1 is a crucial phosphorylation site in the SlMPK1-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant defense mechanism activated during HT stress. We also demonstrate that heterologous expression of <i>SlSPRH1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) led to a decrease in thermotolerance and lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that SlMPK1 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance in tomato plants. SlMPK1 acts by regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant defense, and its substrate SlSPRH1 is involved in this pathway.</p>

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p>Auxin has been shown to enhance root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), auxin may play a negative role in the Al-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of root growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize auxin efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion. Root growth in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to auxin, was less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root tips displayed higher auxin accumulation and enhanced auxin signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the auxin-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of auxin in the root tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more auxin in their root tips. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced auxin accumulation in root tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of root growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of auxin and auxin polar transport in Al-induced root growth regulation in maize.</p>

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the seed mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole seed. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage formation.</p>

An Ethylene-Induced Regulatory Module Delays Flower Senescence by Regulating Cytokinin Content
<p>In many plant species, including rose (<i>Rosa hybrida</i>), flower senescence is promoted by the gaseous hormone ethylene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed by the cytokinin (CTK) class of hormones. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these antagonistic effects are not well understood. In this study, we characterized the association between a pathogenesis-related PR-10 family gene from rose (<i>RhPR10.1</i>) and the hormonal regulation of flower senescence. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that <i>RhPR10.1</i> was expressed at high levels during senescence in different floral organs, including petal, sepal, receptacle, stamen, and pistil, and that expression was induced by ethylene treatment. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of <i>RhPR10.1</i> expression in rose plants by virus-induced gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing accelerated flower senescence, which was accompanied by a higher ion leakage rate in the petals, as well as increased expression of the senescence marker gene <i>RhSAG12</i>. CTK content and the expression of three CTK signaling pathway genes were reduced in <i>RhPR10.1</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants, and the accelerated rate of petal senescence that was apparent in the <i>RhPR10.1</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants was restored to normal levels by CTK treatment. Finally, RhHB6, a homeodomain-Leu zipper I transcription factor, was observed to bind to the <i>RhPR10.1</i> promoter, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of its expression also promoted flower senescence. Our results reveal an ethylene-induced RhHB6-RhPR10.1 regulatory module that functions as a brake of ethylene-promoted senescence through increasing the CTK content.</p>

Furthermore, WT bone marrow (from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice) transplantation in bone marrowâ€“depleted IL10KO mice (IL10KO chimeric mice) reduced transverse aortic constrictionâ€“induced BM-FPC mobilization compared with IL10KO mice. Green fluorescent protein costaining with Î±-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1Î± in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric mice suggests that myofibroblasts were derived from bone marrow after transverse aortic constriction.

Disabling the GÎ²Î³-SNARE interaction disrupts GPCR-mediated presynaptic inhibition, leading to physiological and behavioral phenotypes
<p>G proteinâ€“coupled receptors (GPCRs) that couple to G<sub>i/o</sub> proteins modulate neurotransmission presynaptically by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing exocytosis. Release of GÎ²Î³ subunits from activated G proteins decreases the activity of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs), decreasing excitability. A less understood GÎ²Î³-mediated mechanism downstream of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is the binding of GÎ²Î³ to SNARE complexes, which facilitate the fusion of vesicles with the cell plasma membrane in exocytosis. Here, we generated mice expressing a form of the SNARE protein SNAP25 with premature truncation of the C terminus and that were therefore partially deficient in this interaction.

Blockade of surface-bound TGF-Î² on regulatory T cells abrogates suppression of effector T cell function in the tumor microenvironment
<p>Regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) suppress antitumor immunity by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing the killing of tumor cells by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. To better understand the mechanisms involved, we used ex vivo three-dimensional collagen-fibrin gel cultures of dissociated B16 melanoma tumors.

Immunosuppression was not observed when tumors excised from T<sub>reg</sub>-depleted mice were cultured in this system. Experiments with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong>izing antibodies showed that blocking transforming growth factorâ€“Î² (TGF-Î²) also prevented immunosuppression. Immunosuppression depended on cell-cell contact or cellular proximity because soluble factors from the collagen-fibrin gel cultures did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong> tumor cell killing by T cells. Moreover, intravital, two-photon microscopy showed that tumor-specific Pmel-1 effector T cells physically interacted with tumor-resident T<sub>regs</sub> in mice.

Identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of type 1 adenylyl cyclase activity with analgesic properties

Cobalt-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of enamides enabled by single-electron reduction
<p>Identifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> activation modes that exploit one-electron chemistry and overcome associated deactivation pathways will be transformative for developing first-row transition metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s with performance equal or, ideally, superior to precious metals. Here we describe a zinc-activation method compatible with high-throughput reaction discovery that identified scores of cobalt-phosphine combinations for the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes. An optimized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> prepared from (<i>R</i>,<i>R</i>)-Ph-BPE {Ph-BPE, 1,2-bis[(2<i>R</i>,5<i>R</i>)-2,5-diphenylphospholano]ethane} and cobalt chloride [CoCl<sub>2</sub>Â·6H<sub>2</sub>O] exhibited high activity and enantioselectivity in protic media and enabled the asymmetric synthesis of the epilepsy medication levetiracetam at 200-gram scale with 0.08 mole % <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> loading. Stoichiometric studies established that the cobalt (II) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> precursor (<i>R</i>,<i>R</i>)-Ph-BPECoCl<sub>2</sub> underwent ligand displacement by methanol, and zinc promoted facile one-electron reduction to cobalt (I), which more stably bound the phosphine.</p>

Identification of single-site gold catalysis in acetylene hydrochlorination

Xist recruits the X chromosome to the nuclear lamina to enable chromosome-wide silencing
<p>The Xist long noncoding RNA orchestrates X chromosome inactivation, a process that entails chromosome-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing and remodeling of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the X chromosome. Yet, it remains unclear whether these changes in nuclear structure are mediated by Xist and whether they are required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing. Here, we show that Xist directly interacts with the Lamin B receptor, an integral component of the nuclear lamina, and that this interaction is required for Xist-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing by recruiting the inactive X to the nuclear lamina and by doing so enables Xist to spread to actively transcribed genes across the X. Our results demonstrate that lamina recruitment changes the 3D structure of DNA, enabling Xist and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing proteins to spread across the X to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>e transcription.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>â€™s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seedâ€™s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seedâ€™s physiological properties.</p>

METHIONINE ADENOSYLTRANSFERASE4 Mediates DNA and Histone Methylation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>DNA and histone methylation coregulate heterochromatin formation and gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing in animals and plants. To identify factors involved in maintaining gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing, we conducted a forward genetic screen for mutants that release the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed transgene <i>Pro35S::NEOMYCIN PHOSPHOTRANSFERASE II</i> in the transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line <i>L119</i>. We identified <i>MAT4/SAMS3/MTO3/AT3G17390</i>, which encodes methionine (Met) adenosyltransferase 4 (MAT4)/<i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met synthetase 3 that catalyzes the synthesis of <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met (SAM) in the one-carbon metabolism cycle. <i>mat4</i> mostly decreases CHG and CHH DNA methylation and histone H3K9me2 and reactivates certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed transposons. The exogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of SAM partially rescues the epigenetic defects of <i>mat4</i>. SAM content and DNA methylation were reduced more in <i>mat4</i> than in three other <i>mat</i> mutants. <i>MAT4</i> knockout mutations generated by CRISPR/Cas9 were lethal, indicating that <i>MAT4</i> is an essential gene in Arabidopsis. MAT1, 2, and 4 proteins exhibited nearly equal activity in an in vitro assay, whereas MAT3 exhibited higher activity. The native <i>MAT4</i> promoter driving <i>MAT1</i>, <i>2</i>, and <i>3</i> cDNA complemented the <i>mat4</i> mutant. However, most <i>mat4</i> transgenic lines carrying native <i>MAT1</i>, <i>2</i>, and <i>3</i> promoters driving <i>MAT4</i> cDNA did not complement the <i>mat4</i> mutant because of their lower expression in seedlings. Genetic analyses indicated that the <i>mat1mat4</i> double mutant is dwarfed and the <i>mat2mat4</i> double mutant was nonviable, while <i>mat1mat2</i> showed normal growth and fertility. These results indicate that MAT4 plays a predominant role in SAM production, plant growth, and development. Our findings provide direct evidence of the cooperative actions between metabolism and epigenetic regulation.</p>

Biotin Attachment Domain-Containing Proteins Irreversibly Inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
<p>The first committed step in fatty acid synthesis is mediated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), a biotin-dependent enzyme that carboxylates acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-term or long-term exposure to fatty acids in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly containing oleic acid), which results in reversible or irreversible ACCase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-containing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin carboxyl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporation into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-containing) biotin carboxyltransferase protein subunits. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines containing T-DNA insertions in <i>BADC1</i>, <i>BADC2</i>, and <i>BADC3</i> were used to generate <i>badc1 badc2</i> and <i>badc1 badc3</i> double mutants. The <i>badc1 badc3</i> mutant exhibited normal growth and development; however, ACCase activity was 26% higher in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and its seeds contained 30.1% more fatty acids and 32.6% more triacylgycerol relative to wild-type plants. To assess whether BADC contributes to the irreversible phase of ACCase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion, cell suspension cultures were generated from the leaves of <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type plants and treated with 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tween 80. Reversible ACCase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion was similar in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type cultures after 2 d of Tween 80 treatment, but irreversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion was reduced by 50% in <i>badc1 badc3</i> relative to wild-type plants following 4 d of Tween 80 treatment. In this study, we present evidence for two important homeostatic roles for BADC proteins in down-regulating ACCase activity: by acting during normal growth and development and by contributing to its long-term irreversible feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion resulting from the oversupply of fatty acids.</p>

A Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitor Enhances Resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> Wilt
<p>Pectins are major components of the primary plant cell wall, which functions as the primary barrier against pathogens. Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) catalyze the demethylesterification of the homogalacturonan domains of pectin in the plant cell wall. Their activity is regulated by PME <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors (PMEIs). Here, we provide evidence that the pectin methylesterase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ing protein GhPMEI3 from cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) functions in plant responses to infection by the fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>. GhPMEI3 interacts with PMEs and regulates the expression of a specific fungal polygalacturonase (VdPG1). Ectopic expression of GhPMEI3 increased pectin methyl esterification and limited fungal disease in cotton, while also modulating root elongation. Enzymatic analyses revealed that GhPMEI3 efficiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed the activity of cotton GhPME2/GhPME31. Experiments using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants expressing the <i>GhPMEI3</i> gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter revealed that GhPMEI3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s the endogenous PME activity in vitro. Moreover, the enhanced resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> was associated with altered <i>VdPG1</i> expression. Virus-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of <i>GhPMEI3</i> resulted in increased susceptibility to <i>V. dahliae</i>. Further, we investigated the interaction between GhPMEI3 and GhPME2/GhPME31 using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion assays and molecular docking simulations. The peculiar structural features of GhPMEI3 were responsible for the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with GhPME2/GhPME31. Together, these results suggest that GhPMEI3 enhances resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt. Moreover, GhPMEI3-GhPMEs interactions would be needed before drawing the correlation between structure-function and are crucial for plant development against the ever-evolving fungal pathogens.</p>

The Prenylated Rab GTPase Receptor PRA1.F4 Contributes to Protein Exit from the Golgi Apparatus
<p>Prenylated Rab acceptor1 (PRA1) functions in the recruitment of prenylated Rab proteins to their cognate organelles. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains a large number of proteins belonging to the AtPRA1 family. However, their physiological roles remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the physiological role of AtPRA1.F4, a member of the AtPRA1 family. A T-DNA insertion knockdown mutant of <i>AtPRA1.F4</i>, <i>atpra1.f4</i>, was smaller in stature than parent plants and possessed shorter roots, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing HA:AtPRA1.F4 showed enhanced development of secondary roots and root hairs. However, both overexpression and knockdown plants exhibited increased sensitivity to high-salt stress, lower vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and plasma membrane ATPase activities, lower and higher pH in the vacuole and apoplast, respectively, and highly vesiculated Golgi apparatus. HA:AtPRA1.F4 localized to the Golgi apparatus and assembled into high-molecular-weight complexes. <i>atpra1.f4</i> plants displayed a defect in vacuolar trafficking, which was complemented by low but not high levels of <i>HA</i>:<i>AtPRA1.F4</i>. Overexpression of HA:AtPRA1.F4 also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed protein trafficking at the Golgi apparatus, albeit differentially depending on the final destination or type of protein: trafficking of vacuolar proteins, plasma membrane proteins, and trans-Golgi network (TGN)-localized SYP61 was strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed; trafficking of TGN-localized SYP51 was slightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed; and trafficking of secretory proteins and TGN-localized SYP41 was negligibly or not significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed. Based on these results, we propose that Golgi-localized AtPRA1.F4 is involved in the exit of many but not all types of post-Golgi proteins from the Golgi apparatus. Additionally, an appropriate level of AtPRA1.F4 is crucial for its function at the Golgi apparatus.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>, represents an essential sealing component controlling water and solute movement and protecting seed from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components controlling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator controlling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during seed development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

Transcriptional Gene Silencing Maintained by OTS1 SUMO Protease Requires a DNA-Dependent Polymerase V-Dependent Pathway
<p>The expression of genes with aberrant structure is prevented at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation levels. Aberrant gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing at the posttranscriptional level is well studied; however, it is not well understood how aberrant genes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed at the transcriptional level. In this study, through genetic screening a transgenic report line that harbors an aberrant gene (<i>35S-LUC</i>, lacking 3â€²-untranslated region [3â€²-UTR]) and lacks luciferase (LUC) activity, we identify that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease <i>OTS1</i> gene is required for maintaining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>e of the reporter <i>35S-LUC</i> and an endogenous mutator-like element <i>MULE-F19G14</i> at the transcriptional level, which requires DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) V and DDR complex, but not Pol IV. The increased transcripts in <i>ots1</i> mutants are terminated by the 3â€²-UTRs of downstream genes. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to <i>ots1</i> mutations, mutations in several known or putative SUMO proteases and two SUMO E3 ligases, <i>SIZ1</i> and <i>MMS21</i>, have similar effects on this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing regulation. Taken together, our results reveal that the enzymes involved in the SUMOylation process restrain aberrant gene transcription by using a downstream gene 3â€²-UTR, and this regulation requires a functional Pol V-dependent pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Development of the GABA-ergic signaling system and its role in larval swimming in sea urchin
<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the development and Î³-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic regulation of larval swimming in the sea urchin <i>Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus</i> by cloning glutamate decarboxylase (<i>Hp-gad</i>), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<i>Hp-gabrA</i>) and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein (<i>Hp-gabarap</i>), and by performing immunohistochemistry. The regulation of larval swimming was increasingly dependent on the GABAergic system, which was active from the 2 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.) pluteus stage onwards. GABA-immunoreactive cells were detected as a subpopulation of secondary mesenchyme cells during gastrulation and eventually constituted the ciliary band and a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells during the pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gad</i> transcription was detected by RT-PCR during the period when Hp-Gad-positive cells were seen as a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells and on the apical side of the ciliary band from the 2 d.p.f. pluteus stage. Consistent with these observations, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of GAD with 3-mercaptopropioninc acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed GABA immunoreactivity and larval swimming dose dependently. <i>Hp-gabrA</i> amplimers were detected weakly in unfertilized eggs and 4 d.p.f. plutei but strongly from fertilized eggs to 2 d.p.f. plutei, and Hp-GabrA, together with GABA, was localized at the ciliary band in association with dopamine receptor D1 from the two-arm pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gabarap</i> transcription and protein expression were detected from the swimming blastula stage. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor by bicuculline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed larval swimming dose dependently. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of larval swimming by either 3-mercaptopropionic acid or bicuculline was more severe in older larvae (17 and 34 d.p.f. plutei) than in younger ones (1 d.p.f. prism larvae).</p>

Extended Vernalization Regulates Inflorescence Fate in <i>Arabis alpina</i> by Stably Silencing <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i>
<p>The alpine perennial <i>Arabis alpina</i> initiates flower buds during prolonged exposure to cold. In the accession Pajares, we demonstrate that the length of vernalization influences flowering time and inflorescence fate but does not affect the axillary branches that maintain vegetative growth. The expression of floral organ identity genes gradually increases in the main shoot apex during vernalization, correlating with an increase in floral commitment. In northern Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions, the length of vernalization modulates the stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of the floral repressor <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>). We demonstrate that expression of <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i> (<i>PEP1</i>), the ortholog of <i>FLC</i> in <i>A. alpina</i>, is similarly influenced by the duration of the exposure to cold. Extended vernalization results in stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence. In contrast, insufficient vernalization leads to <i>PEP1</i> reactivation after cold treatment, which correlates with delayed flowering and the appearance of floral reversion phenotypes such as bracts and vegetative inflorescence branches. Floral reversion phenotypes are reduced in the <i>pep1-1</i> mutant, suggesting that <i>PEP1</i> regulates the fate of the inflorescence after vernalization. The effect of vernalization duration on stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing of <i>PEP1</i> is specific to meristems that initiate flowering during cold treatment. Extended vernalization fails to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>e <i>PEP1</i> in young seedlings and axillary branches that arise from buds initiated during cold treatment, which remain vegetative. We conclude that the duration of vernalization in <i>A. alpina</i> differentially regulates <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence and axillary branches. <i>PEP1</i> has a dual role regulating meristem fate; it prevents meristems from flowering and antagonizes inflorescence development after vernalization.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> Ã— <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

TsNAC1 Is a Key Transcription Factor in Abiotic Stress Resistance and Growth
<p>NAC proteins constitute one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors, and a number of these proteins participate in the regulation of plant development and responses to abiotic stress. <i>T. HALOPHILA STRESS RELATED NAC1</i> (<i>TsNAC1</i>), cloned from the halophyte <i>Thellungiella halophila</i>, is a <i>NAC</i> transcription factor gene, and its overexpression can improve abiotic stress resistance, especially in salt stress tolerance, in both <i>T. halophila</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong> the growth of these plants. In this study, the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 and RD26 from Arabidopsis was compared with the target genesâ€™ promoter regions of TsNAC1 from <i>T. halophila</i>, and the results showed that the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 was higher in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) and yeast. The target sequence of the promoter from the target genes also was identified, and TsNAC1 was shown to target the positive regulators of ion transportation, such as <i>T. HALOPHILA H<sup>+</sup>-PPASE1</i>, and the transcription factors <i>MYB HYPOCOTYL ELONGATION-RELATED</i> and <i>HOMEOBOX12</i>.

Based on these results, we propose that TsNAC1 functions as an important upstream regulator of plant abiotic stress responses and vegetative growth.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ative features, this compound in planta and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidation. Both compounds preserved linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of lipids, carnosic acid was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a chemical quencher of ROS. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed lipid peroxidation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this compound, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that chemical quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

Nitric Oxide Mediates Nitrite-Sensing and Acclimation and Triggers a Remodeling of Lipids
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is an intermediate of the nitrogen cycle, an industrial pollutant, and a marker of climate change. NO also acts as a gaseous transmitter in a variety of biological processes. The impact of environmental NO needs to be addressed. In diatoms, a dominant phylum in phytoplankton, NO was reported to mediate programmed cell death in response to diatom-derived polyunsaturated aldehydes. Here, using the <i>Phaeodactylum</i> Pt1 strain, 2E,4E-decadienal supplied in the micromolar concentration range led to a nonspecific cell toxicity. We reexamined NO biosynthesis and response in <i>Phaeodactylum</i>. NO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s cell growth and triggers triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. Feeding experiments indicate that NO is not produced from Arg but via conversion of nitrite by the nitrate reductase. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis shows that NO up-regulates the expression of the plastid nitrite reductase and genes involved in the subsequent incorporation of ammonium into amino acids, via both Gln synthesis and Orn-urea pathway. The phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is also up-regulated, leading to the production of acetyl-CoA, which can feed TAG accumulation upon exposure to NO. Transcriptional reprogramming leading to higher TAG content is balanced with a decrease of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) in the plastid via posttranslational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of MGDG synthase enzymatic activity by NO. Intracellular and transient NO emission acts therefore at the basis of a nitrite-sensing and acclimating system, whereas a long exposure to NO can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ionally induce a redirection of carbon to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutral</span></strong> lipids and a stress response.</p>

Phospholipase C2 Affects MAMP-Triggered Immunity by Modulating ROS Production
<p>The activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) is one of the earliest responses triggered by the recognition of several microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) in plants. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PI-PLC gene family is composed of nine members. Previous studies suggested a role for PLC2 in MAMP-triggered immunity, as it is rapidly phosphorylated in vivo upon treatment with the bacterial MAMP flg22. Here, we analyzed the role of PLC2 in plant immunity using an artificial microRNA to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>e <i>PLC2</i> expression in Arabidopsis. We found that <i>PLC2</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants are more susceptible to the type III secretion system-deficient bacterial strain <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000 <i>hrcC<sup>âˆ’</sup></i> and to the nonadapted pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) powdery mildew <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>. However, <i>PLC2</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants display normal susceptibility to virulent (<i>Pst</i> DC3000) and avirulent (<i>Pst</i> DC3000 AvrRPM1) <i>P. syringae</i> strains, conserving typical hypersensitive response features. In response to flg22, <i>PLC2</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ed plants maintain wild-type mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and <i>PHI1</i>, <i>WRKY33</i>, and <i>FRK1</i> immune marker gene expression but have reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent responses such as callose deposition and stomatal closure. Accordingly, the generation of ROS upon flg22 treatment is compromised in the <i>PLC2</i>-defficient plants, suggesting an effect of PLC2 in a branch of MAMP-triggered immunity and nonhost resistance that involves early ROS-regulated processes. Consistently, PLC2 associates with the NADPH oxidase RBOHD, suggesting its potential regulation by PLC2.</p>

Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its concentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">passiv</span></strong>e, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar concentration to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages conferred by both of these symplastic-loading processes. Here, we present an integrated modelâ€”including local and global transport and kinetics of polymerizationâ€”for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">passiv</span></strong>e and active symplastic loading. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">passiv</span></strong>e loading, polymerization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates export for a given concentration of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of active and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">passiv</span></strong>e symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of chloroplast metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning chloroplast function is to establish the relationship between these two redox systems and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">antioxid</span></strong>ant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ed phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant chloroplast ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in chloroplast redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons chloroplasts, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

Roles of Dicer-Like Proteins 2 and 4 in Intra- and Intercellular Antiviral Silencing<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing is an innate antiviral mechanism conserved in organisms across kingdoms. Such a cellular defense involves DICER or DICER-LIKEs (DCLs) that process plant virus RNAs into viral small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs). Plants encode four <i>DCLs</i> that play diverse roles in cell-autonomous intracellular virus-induced RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing (known as VIGS) against viral invasion. VIGS can spread between cells. However, the genetic basis and involvement of vsiRNAs in non-cell-autonomous intercellular VIGS remains poorly understood. Using GFP as a reporter gene together with a suite of <i>DCL</i> RNAi transgenic lines, here we show that despite the well-established activities of <i>DCLs</i> in intracellular VIGS and vsiRNA biogenesis, <i>DCL4</i> acts to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong> intercellular VIGS whereas <i>DCL2</i> is required (likely along with DCL2-processed/dependent vsiRNAs and their precursor RNAs) for efficient intercellular VIGS trafficking from epidermal to adjacent cells. <i>DCL4</i> imposed an epistatic effect on <i>DCL2</i> to impede cell-to-cell spread of VIGS. Our results reveal previously unknown functions for <i>DCL2</i> and <i>DCL4</i> that may form a dual defensive frontline for intra- and intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">silenc</span></strong>ing to double-protect cells from virus infection in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>.</p>

Suppressor of Overexpression of CO 1 Negatively Regulates Dark-Induced Leaf Degreening and Senescence by Directly Repressing Pheophytinase and Other Senescence-Associated Genes in Arabidopsis
<p>Although the biochemical pathway of chlorophyll (Chl) degradation has been largely elucidated, how Chl is rapidly yet coordinately degraded during leaf senescence remains elusive. Pheophytinase (PPH) is the enzyme for catalyzing the removal of the phytol group from pheophytin <i>a</i>, and <i>PPH</i> expression is significantly induced during leaf senescence. To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of <i>PPH</i>, we used a yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) one-hybrid system to screen for its trans-regulators. SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1), a key flowering pathway integrator, was initially identified as one of the putative trans-regulators of <i>PPH</i>. After dark treatment, leaves of an <i>SOC1</i> knockdown mutant (<i>soc1-6</i>) showed an accelerated yellowing phenotype, whereas those of <i>SOC1</i>-overexpressing lines exhibited a partial stay-green phenotype. <i>SOC1</i> and <i>PPH</i> expression showed a negative correlation during leaf senescence. Substantially, SOC1 protein could bind specifically to the CArG box of the <i>PPH</i> promoter in vitro and in vivo, and overexpression of <i>SOC1</i> significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ed the transcriptional activity of the <i>PPH</i> promoter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) protoplasts. Importantly, <i>soc1-6 pph-1</i> (a <i>PPH</i> knockout mutant) double mutant displayed a stay-green phenotype similar to that of <i>pph-1</i> during dark treatment. These results demonstrated that SOC1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>s Chl degradation via negatively regulating <i>PPH</i> expression. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, measurement of the Chl content and the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II of <i>soc1-6</i> and <i>SOC1-OE</i> leaves after dark treatment suggested that SOC1 also negatively regulates the general senescence process. Seven <i>SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENES</i> (<i>SAGs</i>) were thereafter identified as its potential target genes, and <i>NONYELLOWING1</i> and <i>SAG113</i> were experimentally confirmed. Together, we reveal that SOC1 represses dark-induced leaf Chl degradation and senescence in general in Arabidopsis.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong>s, and their expression requires seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong> epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

cis-Cinnamic Acid Is a Novel, Natural Auxin Efflux Inhibitor That Promotes Lateral Root Formation
<p>Auxin steers numerous physiological processes in plants, making the tight control of its endogenous levels and spatiotemporal distribution a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms, including auxin biosynthesis, metabolic conversions, degradation, and transport. Here, we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (<i>c</i>-CA) as a novel and unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to a small group of endogenous molecules affecting in planta auxin concentrations. <i>c-CA</i> is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (<i>t</i>-CA). When grown on <i>c</i>-CA-containing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of plant species were shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high auxin levels, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of primary root growth, induction of root hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral rooting. By molecular docking and receptor binding assays, we showed that <i>c</i>-CA itself is neither an auxin nor an anti-auxin, and auxin profiling data revealed that <i>c</i>-CA does not significantly interfere with auxin biosynthesis. Single cell-based auxin accumulation assays showed that <i>c</i>-CA, and not <i>t</i>-CA, is a potent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>or of auxin efflux. Auxin signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal distribution of the auxin response along the root of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants, and long-distance auxin transport assays showed no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of rootward auxin transport. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants are the consequence of a local change in auxin accumulation, induced by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibit</span></strong>ion of auxin efflux. This work reveals a novel mechanism how plants may regulate auxin levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of auxin homeostasis.</p>

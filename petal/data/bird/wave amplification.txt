Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma
<p>Particle acceleration by plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s and spontaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> generation are fundamental energy and momentum exchange processes in collisionless plasmas. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-particle interactions occur ubiquitously in space. We present ultrafast measurements in Earth’s magnetosphere by the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft that enabled quantitative evaluation of energy transfer in interactions associated with electromagnetic ion cyclotron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. The observed ion distributions are not symmetric around the magnetic field direction but are in phase with the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> fields. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-ion phase relations demonstrate that a cyclotron resonance transferred energy from hot protons to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, which in turn nonresonantly accelerated cold He<sup>+</sup> to energies up to ~2 kilo–electron volts. These observations provide direct quantitative evidence for collisionless energy transfer in plasmas between distinct particle populations via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-particle interactions.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Apoptosis propagates through the cytoplasm as trigger waves
<p>Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved form of programmed cell death critical for development and tissue homeostasis in animals. The apoptotic control network includes several positive feedback loops that may allow apoptosis to spread through the cytoplasm in self-regenerating trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. We tested this possibility in cell-free <i>Xenopus laevis</i> egg extracts and observed apoptotic trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute. Fractionation and inhibitor studies implicated multiple feedback loops in generating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. Apoptotic oocytes and eggs exhibited surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute, which were tightly correlated with caspase activation. Thus, apoptosis spreads through trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in both extracts and intact cells. Our findings show how apoptosis can spread over large distances within a cell and emphasize the general importance of trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in cell signaling.</p>

Topological origin of equatorial waves
<p>Topology sheds new light on the emergence of unidirectional edge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in a variety of physical systems, from condensed matter to artificial lattices. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s observed in geophysical flows are also robust to perturbations, which suggests a role for topology. We show a topological origin for two well-known equatorially trapped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, the Kelvin and Yanai modes, owing to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by Earth’s rotation. The nontrivial structure of the bulk PoincaréÉééé <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> modes encoded through the first Chern number of value 2 guarantees the existence of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s.

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The dynamics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets. However, the rapidity of electron dynamics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets in the time domain. Using spectrally resolved electron interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photoelectron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packet created through a Fano autoionizing resonance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing resonance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission dynamics governed by electron correlation, as well as coherent control over structured electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets.</p>

Shear properties of Earth’s inner core constrained by a detection of <i>J</i> waves in global correlation wavefield
<p>Seismic <i>J</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s, shear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s that traverse Earth’s inner core, provide direct constraints on the inner core’s solidity and shear properties. However, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s have been elusive in the direct seismic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>field because of their small amplitudes. We devised a new method to detect <i>J</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s in the earthquake coda correlation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>field. They manifest through the similarity with other compressional core-sensitive signals. The inner core is solid, but relatively soft, with shear-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> speeds and shear moduli of 3.42 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 149.0 ± 1.6 gigapascals (GPa) near the inner core boundary and 3.58 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 167.4 ± 1.6 GPa in Earth’s center. The values are 2.5% lower than the widely used Preliminary Earth Reference Model. This provides new constraints on the dynamical interpretation of Earth’s inner core.</p>

Hippocampal ripples down-regulate synapses
<p>The specific effects of sleep on synaptic plasticity remain unclear. We report that mouse hippocampal sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripple oscillations serve as intrinsic events that trigger long-lasting synaptic depression. Silencing of sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripples during slow-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> states prevented the spontaneous down-regulation of net synaptic weights and impaired the learning of new memories. The synaptic down-regulation was dependent on the <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor and selective for a specific input pathway. Thus, our findings are consistent with the role of slow-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> states in refining memory engrams by reducing recent memory-irrelevant neuronal activity and suggest a previously unrecognized function for sharp-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> ripples.</p>

Magnetic field–induced pair density wave state in the cuprate vortex halo
<p>High magnetic fields suppress cuprate superconductivity to reveal an unusual density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> (DW) state coexisting with unexplained quantum oscillations. Although routinely labeled a charge density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> (CDW), this DW state could actually be an electron-pair density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> (PDW). To search for evidence of a field-induced PDW, we visualized modulations in the density of electronic states <i>N</i>(<i>r</i>) within the halo surrounding Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> vortex cores. We detected numerous phenomena predicted for a field-induced PDW, including two sets of particle-hole symmetric <i>N</i>(<i>r</i>) modulations with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> vectors <bold><i>Q<sub>P</sub></i></bold> and <bold>2<i>Q</i><sub>P</sub></bold>, with the latter decaying twice as rapidly from the core as the former.

Anti–parity-time symmetry in diffusive systems
<p>Various concepts related to parity-time symmetry, including anti–parity-time symmetry, have found broad applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> physics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> systems are fundamentally described by Hermitian operators, whereas their unusual properties are introduced by incorporation of gain and loss. We propose that the related physics need not be restricted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> dynamics, and we consider systems described by diffusive dynamics. We study the heat transfer in two countermoving media and show that this system exhibits anti–parity-time symmetry. The spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a phase transition from motionless temperature profiles, despite the mechanical motion of the background, to moving temperature profiles. Our results extend the concepts of parity-time symmetry beyond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> physics and may offer opportunities to manipulate heat and mass transport.</p>

Electrical generation and detection of spin waves in a quantum Hall ferromagnet

Electromagnetic evidence that SSS17a is the result of a binary neutron star merger

Although the gravitational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> data indicate that GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints on the nature of that system. We synthesize the optical to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process).

Coherent imaging of an attosecond electron wave packet
<p>Electrons detached from atoms or molecules by photoionization carry information about the quantum state from which they originate, as well as the continuum states into which they are released. Generally, the photoelectron momentum distribution is composed of a coherent sum of angular momentum components, each with an amplitude and phase. Here we show, by using photoionization of neon, that a train of attosecond pulses synchronized with an infrared laser field can be used to disentangle these angular momentum components. Two-color, two-photon ionization via a Stark-shifted intermediate state creates an almost pure f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> with a magnetic quantum number of zero. Interference of the f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> with a spherically symmetric s-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> provides a holographic reference that enables phase-resolved imaging of the f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Importance of Fluctuations in Light on Plant Photosynthetic Acclimation
<p>The acclimation of plants to light has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effect of dynamic fluctuations in light on plant phenotype and acclimatory responses. We mimicked natural fluctuations in light over a diurnal period to examine the effect on the photosynthetic processes and growth of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). High and low light intensities, delivered via a realistic dynamic fluctuating or square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> pattern, were used to grow and assess plants. Plants subjected to square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> light had thicker leaves and greater photosynthetic capacity compared with fluctuating light-grown plants. This, together with elevated levels of proteins associated with electron transport, indicates greater investment in leaf structural components and photosynthetic processes. In contrast, plants grown under fluctuating light had thinner leaves, lower leaf light absorption, but maintained similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area to square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-grown plants. Despite high light use efficiency, plants grown under fluctuating light had a slow growth rate early in development, likely due to the fact that plants grown under fluctuating conditions were not able to fully utilize the light energy absorbed for carbon fixation. Diurnal leaf-level measurements revealed a negative feedback control of photosynthesis, resulting in a decrease in total diurnal carbon assimilated of at least 20%. These findings highlight that growing plants under square <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> growth conditions ultimately fails to predict plant performance under realistic light regimes and stress the importance of considering fluctuations in incident light in future experiments that aim to infer plant productivity under natural conditions in the field.</p>

Atmospheric blocking as a traffic jam in the jet stream
<p>Atmospheric blocking due to anomalous, persistent meandering of the jet stream often causes weather extremes in the mid-latitudes. Despite the ubiquity of blocking, the onset mechanism is not well understood. Here we demonstrate a close analogy between blocking and traffic congestion on a highway by using meteorological data and show that blocking and traffic congestion can be described by a common mathematical theory. The theory predicts that the jet stream has a capacity for the flux of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> activity (a measure of meandering), just as the highway has traffic capacity, and when the capacity is exceeded, blocking manifests as congestion. Stationary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s modulate the jet stream’s capacity for transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s and localize block formation. Climate change likely affects blocking frequency by modifying the jet stream’s proximity to capacity.</p>

Determination of intrinsic attenuation in the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system
<p>We recorded <i>P</i> and <i>S</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s traveling through the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system (LAS) using broadband ocean-bottom seismometers in the northwest Pacific, and we quantitatively separated the intrinsic (anelastic) and extrinsic (scattering) attenuation effects on seismic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> propagation to directly infer the thermomechanical properties of the oceanic LAS. The strong intrinsic attenuation in the asthenosphere obtained at higher frequency (~3 hertz) is comparable to that constrained at lower frequency (~100 seconds) by surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s and suggests frequency-independent anelasticity, whereas the intrinsic attenuation in the lithosphere is frequency dependent. This difference in frequency dependence indicates that the strong and broad peak dissipation recently observed in the laboratory exists only in the asthenosphere and provides new insight into what distinguishes the asthenosphere from the lithosphere.</p>

Single-cell whole-genome analyses by Linear Amplification via Transposon Insertion (LIANTI)
<p>Single-cell genomics is important for biology and medicine.

This allowed direct observation of stochastic firing of DNA replication origins, which differs from cell to cell. We also show that the predominant cytosine-to-thymine mutations observed in single-cell genomics often arise from the artifact of cytosine deamination upon cell lysis. However, identifying single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) can be accomplished by sequencing kindred cells. We determined the spectrum of SNVs in a single human cell after ultraviolet radiation, revealing their nonrandom genome-wide distribution.</p>

Spiral density waves in a young protoplanetary disk

The arms extend to the disk outer regions and can be traced down to the midplane. These millimeter-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> observations also reveal an emission gap closer to the star than the spiral arms.

Starch Turnover and Metabolism during Flower and Early Embryo Development
<p>The accumulation of starch within photosynthetic tissues and within dedicated storage organs has been characterized extensively in many species, and a function in buffering carbon availability or in fueling later growth phases, respectively, has been proposed. However, developmentally regulated starch turnover within heterotrophic tissues other than dedicated storage organs is poorly characterized, and its function is not well understood. Here, we report on the characterization of starch turnover during flower, early embryo, and silique development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a combined clearing-staining technique on whole-mount tissue. Besides the two previously documented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s of transient starch accumulation in the stamen envelope, occurring during meiosis and pollen mitosis I, we identified a novel, third <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> of starch amylogenesis/amylolysis during the last stages of stamen development. To gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, we analyzed publicly available microarray data, which revealed a developmentally coordinated expression of carbohydrate transport and metabolism genes during these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s of transient starch accumulation. Based on this analysis, we characterized starch dynamics in mutants affecting hexose phosphate metabolism and translocation, and identified the Glc-6-phosphate/phosphate antiporter GPT1 as the putative translocator of Glc-6-phosphate for starch biosynthesis in reproductive tissues. Based on these results, we propose a model of starch synthesis within the pollen grain and discuss the nutrient transport route feeding the embryo within the developing seed.</p>

Voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into smooth muscle during contraction promotes endothelium-mediated feedback vasodilation in arterioles
<p>Vascular smooth muscle contraction is suppressed by feedback dilation mediated by the endothelium. In skeletal muscle arterioles, this feedback can be activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals passing from smooth muscle through gap junctions to endothelial cells, which protrude through holes in the internal elastic lamina to make contact with vascular smooth muscle cells. Although hypothetically either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) may provide the intercellular signal, it is generally thought that IP<sub>3</sub> diffusion is responsible. We provide evidence that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCCs) in vascular smooth muscle can pass to the endothelium through positions aligned with holes in the internal elastic lamina in amounts sufficient to activate endothelial cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. In endothelial cells in which IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>Rs) were blocked, VDCC-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> events were transient and localized to the endothelium that protrudes through the internal elastic lamina to contact vascular smooth muscle cells. In endothelial cells in which IP<sub>3</sub>Rs were not blocked, VDCC-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in endothelial cells were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ied to form propagating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s activated voltage-insensitive, intermediate-conductance, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (IK<sub>Ca</sub>) channels, thereby providing feedback that effectively suppressed vasoconstriction and enabled cycles of constriction and dilation called vasomotion. Thus, agonists that stimulate vascular smooth muscle depolarization provide Ca<sup>2+</sup> to endothelial cells to activate a feedback circuit that protects tissue blood flow.</p>

Multiplatform evaluation of global trends in wind speed and wave height

The largest increases occur in the Southern Ocean. Confidence in the results is strengthened because the wind speed trends are confirmed by all three satellite systems.

The use of a Schottky barrier for the source gave the transistor geometry-independent electrical characteristics and accommodated the large dimensional variation in inkjet-printed features.

The low-frequency source of Saturn’s kilometric radiation
<p>Understanding how auroral radio emissions are produced by magnetized bodies requires in situ measurements within their source region. Saturn’s kilometric radiation (SKR) has been widely used as a remote proxy of Saturn’s magnetosphere. We present <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> and plasma measurements from the Cassini spacecraft during its ring-grazing high-inclination orbits, which passed three times through the high-altitude SKR emission region. Northern dawn-side, narrow-banded radio sources were encountered at frequencies of 10 to 20 kilohertz, within regions of upward currents mapping to the ultraviolet auroral oval. The kilometric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s were produced on the extraordinary mode by the cyclotron maser instability from 6– to 12–kilo–electron volt electron beams and radiated quasi-perpendicularly to the auroral magnetic field lines. The SKR low-frequency sources appear to be strongly controlled by time-variable magnetospheric electron densities.</p>

Suppressing spatiotemporal lasing instabilities with wave-chaotic microcavities
<p>Spatiotemporal instabilities are widespread phenomena resulting from complexity and nonlinearity. In broad-area edge-emitting semiconductor lasers, the nonlinear interactions of multiple spatial modes with the active medium can result in filamentation and spatiotemporal chaos. These instabilities degrade the laser performance and are extremely challenging to control. We demonstrate a powerful approach to suppress spatiotemporal instabilities using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-chaotic or disordered cavities. The interference of many propagating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s with random phases in such cavities disrupts the formation of self-organized structures such as filaments, resulting in stable lasing dynamics. Our method provides a general and robust scheme to prevent the formation and growth of nonlinear instabilities for a large variety of high-power lasers.</p>

Three-dimensional genome structures of single diploid human cells
<p>Three-dimensional genome structures play a key role in gene regulation and cell functions. Characterization of genome structures necessitates single-cell measurements. This has been achieved for haploid cells but has remained a challenge for diploid cells. We developed a single-cell chromatin conformation capture method, termed Dip-C, that combines a transposon-based whole-genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication method to detect many chromatin contacts, called META (multiplex end-tagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication), and an algorithm to impute the two chromosome haplotypes linked by each contact. We reconstructed the genome structures of single diploid human cells from a lymphoblastoid cell line and from primary blood cells with high spatial resolution, locating specific single-nucleotide and copy number variations in the nucleus. The two alleles of imprinted loci and the two X chromosomes were structurally different. Cells of different types displayed statistically distinct genome structures. Such structural cell typing is crucial for understanding cell functions.</p>

Abrupt cloud clearing of marine stratocumulus in the subtropical southeast Atlantic
<p>We document rapid and abrupt clearings of large portions of the subtropical marine low cloud deck that have implications for the global radiation balance and climate sensitivity. Over the southeast Atlantic, large areas of stratocumulus are quickly eroded, yielding partial or complete clearing along sharp transitions hundreds to thousands of kilometers in length that move westward at 8 to 12 meters per second and travel as far as 1000+ kilometers from the African coast. The westward-moving cloudiness reductions have an annual peak in occurrence in the period from April through June. The cloud erosion boundaries reduce cloud at ≈10-kilometer scale in less than 15 minutes, move approximately perpendicular to the mean flow, and are often accompanied by small-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> features. Observations suggest that the cloud erosion is caused by atmospheric gravity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s.</p>

Torsional instability in the single-chain limit of a transition metal trichalcogenide
<p>The scientific bounty resulting from the successful isolation of few to single layers of two-dimensional materials suggests that related new physics resides in the few- to single-chain limit of one-dimensional materials. We report the synthesis of the quasi–one-dimensional transition metal trichalcogenide NbSe<sub>3</sub> (niobium triselenide) in the few-chain limit, including the realization of isolated single chains. The chains are encapsulated in protective boron nitride or carbon nanotube sheaths to prevent oxidation and to facilitate characterization. Transmission electron microscopy reveals static and dynamic structural torsional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s not found in bulk NbSe<sub>3</sub> crystals. Electronic structure calculations indicate that charge transfer drives the torsional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> instability.

Phase transitions in a programmable quantum spin glass simulator
<p>Understanding magnetic phases in quantum mechanical systems is one of the essential goals in condensed matter physics, and the advent of prototype quantum simulation hardware has provided new tools for experimentally probing such systems. We report on the experimental realization of a quantum simulation of interacting Ising spins on three-dimensional cubic lattices up to dimensions 8 × 8 × 8 on a D-Wave processor (D-Wave Systems, Burnaby, Canada). The ability to control and read out the state of individual spins provides direct access to several order parameters, which we used to determine the lattice’s magnetic phases as well as critical disorder and one of its universal exponents. By tuning the degree of disorder and effective transverse magnetic field, we observed phase transitions between a paramagnetic, an antiferromagnetic, and a spin-glass phase.</p>

Imaging CF<sub>3</sub>I conical intersection and photodissociation dynamics with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>Conical intersections play a critical role in excited-state dynamics of polyatomic molecules because they govern the reaction pathways of many nonadiabatic processes. However, ultrafast probes have lacked sufficient spatial resolution to image <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-packet trajectories through these intersections directly. Here, we present the simultaneous experimental characterization of one-photon and two-photon excitation channels in isolated CF<sub>3</sub>I molecules using ultrafast gas-phase electron diffraction. In the two-photon channel, we have mapped out the real-space trajectories of a coherent nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packet, which bifurcates onto two potential energy surfaces when passing through a conical intersection. In the one-photon channel, we have resolved excitation of both the umbrella and the breathing vibrational modes in the CF<sub>3</sub> fragment in multiple nuclear dimensions.

Light amplification by seeded Kerr instability
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of femtosecond laser pulses typically requires a lasing medium or a nonlinear crystal.

Mapping the malaria parasite druggable genome by using in vitro evolution and chemogenomics
<p>Chemogenetic characterization through in vitro evolution combined with whole-genome analysis can identify antimalarial drug targets and drug-resistance genes. We performed a genome analysis of 262 <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> parasites resistant to 37 diverse compounds. We found 159 gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ications and 148 nonsynonymous changes in 83 genes associated with drug-resistance acquisition, where gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ications contributed to one-third of resistance acquisition events. Beyond confirming previously identified multidrug-resistance mechanisms, we discovered hitherto unrecognized drug target–inhibitor pairs, including thymidylate synthase and a benzoquinazolinone, farnesyltransferase and a pyrimidinedione, and a dipeptidylpeptidase and an arylurea. This exploration of the <i>P. falciparum</i> resistome and druggable genome will likely guide drug discovery and structural biology efforts, while also advancing our understanding of resistance mechanisms available to the malaria parasite.</p>

Attosecond-resolved photoionization of chiral molecules
<p>Chiral light-matter interactions have been investigated for two centuries, leading to the discovery of many chiroptical processes used for discrimination of enantiomers. Whereas most chiroptical effects result from a response of bound electrons, photoionization can produce much stronger chiral signals that manifest as asymmetries in the angular distribution of the photoelectrons along the light-propagation axis. We implemented self-referenced attosecond photoelectron interferometry to measure the temporal profile of the forward and backward electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets emitted upon photoionization of camphor by circularly polarized laser pulses. We measured a delay between electrons ejected forward and backward, which depends on the ejection angle and reaches 24 attoseconds. The asymmetric temporal shape of electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> packets emitted through an autoionizing state further reveals the chiral character of strongly correlated electronic dynamics.</p>

The beating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>s have similar amplitudes but slightly different apparent periods because of differing velocities or directions.

On the generation of solar spicules and Alfvénic waves

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

Superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex replay independently of the hippocampus
<p>The hippocampus is thought to initiate systems-wide mnemonic processes through the reactivation of previously acquired spatial and episodic memory traces, which can recruit the entorhinal cortex as a first stage of memory redistribution to other brain areas. Hippocampal reactivation occurs during sharp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>–ripples, in which synchronous network firing encodes sequences of places. We investigated the coordination of this replay by recording assembly activity simultaneously in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex. We found that entorhinal cell assemblies can replay trajectories independently of the hippocampus and sharp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong>–ripples. This suggests that the hippocampus is not the sole initiator of spatial and episodic memory trace reactivation. Memory systems involved in these processes may include nonhierarchical, parallel components.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ied at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ied <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ied foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into chromosomes. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

Identification of a New Host Factor Required for Antiviral RNAi and Amplification of Viral siRNAs
<p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are processed from virus-specific dsRNA to direct antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) in diverse eukaryotic hosts. We have recently performed a sensitized genetic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and identified two related phospholipid flippases required for antiviral RNAi and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of virus-derived siRNAs by plant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase1 (RDR1) and RDR6. Here we report the identification and cloning of <i>ANTIVIRAL RNAI</i>-<i>DEFECTIVE2</i> (<i>AVI2</i>) from the same genetic screen. <i>AVI2</i> encodes a multispan transmembrane protein broadly conserved in plants and animals with two homologous human proteins known as magnesium transporters. We show that <i>avi2</i> mutant plants display no developmental defects and develop severe disease symptoms after infection with a mutant <i>Cucumber mosaic virus</i> (CMV) defective in RNAi suppression. <i>AVI2</i> is induced by CMV infection, particularly in veins, and is required for antiviral RNAi and RDR6-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs. AVI2 is also necessary for Dicer-like2-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs induced in <i>dcl4</i> mutant plants by infection, but dispensable for RDR6-dependent biogenesis of endogenous transacting siRNAs. Further genetic studies illustrate that AVI2 plays a partially redundant role with AVI2H, the most closely related member in the <i>AVI2</i> gene family, in RDR1-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs and the endogenous virus-activated siRNAs (vasi-RNAs). Interestingly, we discovered a specific genetic interaction of AVI2 with AVI1 flippase that is critical for plant development. We propose that AVI1 and AVI2 participate in the virus-induced formation of the RDR1/RDR6-specific, membrane-bound RNA synthesis compartment, essential for the biogenesis of highly abundant viral siRNAs and vasi-RNAs.</p>

A Genetic Screen for Impaired Systemic RNAi Highlights the Crucial Role of DICER-LIKE 2
<p>Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of transgenes involves abundant 21-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and low-abundance 22-nucleotide siRNAs produced from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by DCL4 and DCL2, respectively. However, DCL2 facilitates the recruitment of RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) to ARGONAUTE 1-derived cleavage products, resulting in more efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of secondary and transitive dsRNA and siRNAs. Here, we describe a reporter system where RDR6-dependent PTGS is initiated by restricted expression of an inverted-repeat dsRNA specifically in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root tip, allowing a genetic screen to identify mutants impaired in RDR6-dependent systemic PTGS. Our screen identified <i>dcl2</i> but not <i>dcl4</i> mutants. Moreover, grafting experiments showed that DCL2, but not DCL4, is required in both the source rootstock and the recipient shoot tissue for efficient RDR6-dependent systemic PTGS. Furthermore, <i>dcl4</i> rootstocks produced more DCL2-dependent 22-nucleotide siRNAs than the wild type and showed enhanced systemic movement of PTGS to grafted shoots. Thus, along with its role in recruiting RDR6 for further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of PTGS, DCL2 is crucial for RDR6-dependent systemic PTGS.</p>

Physical Mapping of Amplified Copies of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Glyphosate-Resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>

We report that glyphosate resistance in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> was due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-P synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) gene, which encodes the molecular target of glyphosate. There was a positive correlation between <i>EPSPS</i> gene copies and its transcript expression. We analyzed the distribution of <i>EPSPS</i> copies in the genome of <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> using fluorescence in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis mapped the <i>EPSPS</i> gene to pericentromeric regions of two homologous chromosomes in glyphosate sensitive <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>. In glyphosate-resistant plants, a cluster of <i>EPSPS</i> genes on the pericentromeric region on one pair of homologous chromosomes was detected. Intriguingly, two highly glyphosate-resistant plants harbored an additional chromosome with several <i>EPSPS</i> copies besides the native chromosome pair with <i>EPSPS</i> copies. These results suggest that the initial event of <i>EPSPS</i> gene duplication may have occurred because of unequal recombination mediated by repetitive DNA. Subsequently, gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication may have resulted via several other mechanisms, such as chromosomal rearrangements, deletion/insertion, transposon-mediated dispersion, or possibly by interspecific hybridization. This report illustrates the physical mapping of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ied <i>EPSPS</i> copies in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
High Fitness Costs and Instability of Gene Duplications Reduce Rates of Evolution of New Genes by Duplication-Divergence Mechanisms
<p>An important mechanism for generation of new genes is by duplication-divergence of existing genes. Duplication-divergence includes several different submodels, such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of neutral mutations the original function is distributed between two partially functional and complementary genes, and neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the fitness cost and genetic stability of the duplications. Here, we determined the fitness cost and stability of defined gene duplications/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ications on a low copy number plasmid. Our experimental results show that the costs of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each additional kilo base pairs of DNA reduces fitness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the fitness costs and instability strongly reduces the likelihood of both sub- and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial functions.</p>

An on/off Berry phase switch in circular graphene resonators

Berry phases typically have been accessed through interference experiments. Here, we demonstrate an unusual Berry phase–induced spectroscopic feature: a sudden and large increase in the energy of angular-momentum states in circular graphene p-n junction resonators when a relatively small critical magnetic field is reached. This behavior results from turning on a π Berry phase associated with the topological properties of Dirac fermions in graphene. The Berry phase can be switched on and off with small magnetic field changes on the order of 10 millitesla, potentially enabling a variety of optoelectronic graphene device applications.</p>

Juno’s energetic particle and plasma detectors measured electrons precipitating in the polar regions, exciting intense aurorae, observed simultaneously by the ultraviolet and infrared imaging spectrographs. Juno transited beneath the most intense parts of the radiation belts, passed about 4000 kilometers above the cloud tops at closest approach, well inside the jovian rings, and recorded the electrical signatures of high-velocity impacts with small particles as it traversed the equator.</p>

Nucleic acid detection with CRISPR-Cas13a/C2c2
<p>Rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive nucleic acid detection may aid point-of-care pathogen detection, genotyping, and disease monitoring. The RNA-guided, RNA-targeting clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) effector Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) exhibits a “collateral effect” of promiscuous ribonuclease activity upon target recognition. We combine the collateral effect of Cas13a with isothermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication to establish a CRISPR-based diagnostic (CRISPR-Dx), providing rapid DNA or RNA detection with attomolar sensitivity and single-base mismatch specificity. We use this Cas13a-based molecular detection platform, termed Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK), to detect specific strains of Zika and Dengue virus, distinguish pathogenic bacteria, genotype human DNA, and identify mutations in cell-free tumor DNA. Furthermore, SHERLOCK reaction reagents can be lyophilized for cold-chain independence and long-term storage and be readily reconstituted on paper for field applications.</p>

Formation of matter-wave soliton trains by modulational instability
<p>Nonlinear systems can exhibit a rich set of dynamics that are inherently sensitive to their initial conditions. One such example is modulational instability, which is believed to be one of the most prevalent instabilities in nature. By exploiting a shallow zero-crossing of a Feshbach resonance, we characterize modulational instability and its role in the formation of matter-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wave</span></strong> soliton trains from a Bose-Einstein condensate. We examine the universal scaling laws exhibited by the system and, through real-time imaging, address a long-standing question of whether the solitons in trains are created with effectively repulsive nearest-neighbor interactions or rather evolve into such a structure.</p>

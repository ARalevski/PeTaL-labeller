Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> kit for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">review</span></strong> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">review</span></strong>s and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion criteria were all clinical studies where the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s   of PJI was uncertain.

Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e air samples from stem chambers. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with samples from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sensors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong>d to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field samples (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable sensors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the sensors’ methods enable accurate ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

The validity and reproducibility of cross table radiographs compared with CT scans for the measurement of anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and validity   of cross table radiographs for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing the anteversion of the   acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to compare   it with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements using CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 29 patients who underwent THA between June 2010 and   January 2016 were included. There were 17 men and 12 women. Their   mean age was 43 years (26 to 65). Seven patients underwent a bilateral   procedure. Thus, 36 THAs were included in the study. Lateral radiographs   and CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later. The anteversion of the acetabular component was   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed using the method described by Woo and Morrey and the ischiolateral   method described by Pulos et al and these were compared with the   results obtained from CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean anteversion was 18.35° (3° to 38°) using Woo and Morrey’s   method, 51.45° (30° to 85°) using the ischiolateral method and 21.22°   (2° to 48°) using CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s. The Pearson correlation coefficient   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method.

An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used different definitions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for misinterpretation of the   results.

Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis in the United Kingdom
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) infection of bones and joints accounts for   6.7% of TB cases in England, and is associated with significant   morbidity and disability. Public Health England reports that patients   with TB experience delays in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s and treatment. Our aims were   to determine the demographics, presentation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">investig</span></strong>ation of   patients with a TB infection of bones and joints, to help doctors   assessing potential cases and to identify avoidable delays.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ational study of all adults with   positive TB cultures on specimens taken at a tertiary orthopaedic   centre between June 2012 and May 2014. A laboratory information   system search identified the patients. The demographics, clinical presentation,   radiology, histopathology and key clinical dates were obtained from   medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 31 adult patients were identified. Their median age   was 37 years (interquartile range (IQR): 29 to 53); 21 (68%) were   male; 89% were migrants. The main sites affected were joints (10,   32%), the spine (8, 26%) and long bones (6, 19%); 8 (26%) had multifocal   disease. The most common presenting symptoms were pain (29/31, 94%)   and swelling (26/28, 93%). ‘Typical’ symptoms of TB, such as fever,   sweats and weight loss, were uncommon. Patients waited a median   of seven months (IQR 3 to 13.5) between the onset of symptoms and referral   to the tertiary centre and 2.3 months (IQR 1.6 to 3.4.)) between   referral and starting treatment. Radiology suggested TB in 26 (84%),   but in seven patients (23%) the initial biopsy specimens were not   sent for mycobacterial culture, necessitating a second biopsy. Rapid   Polymerase Chain Reaction-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing for TB using Xpert MTB/RIF   was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed in five patients; 4 (80%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed positive for TB.

Prognostic Value of Noninvasive Cardiovascular Testing in Patients With Stable Chest Pain
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Optimal management of patients with stable chest pain relies on the prognostic information provided by noninvasive cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing, but there are limited data from randomized trials comparing anatomic with functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain and intermediate pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> probability for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomly assigned to functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). Site-based diagnostic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> reports were classified as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal. The primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalizations over a median follow-up of 26.1 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both the prevalence of normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results and incidence rate of events in these patients were significantly lower among 4500 patients randomly assigned to CTA in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with 4602 patients randomly assigned to functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (33.4% versus 78.0%, and 0.9% versus 2.1%, respectively; both <i>P</i><0.001). In CTA, 54.0% of events (n=74/137) occurred in patients with nonobstructive CAD (1%–69% stenosis). Prevalence of obstructive CAD and myocardial ischemia was low (11.9% versus 12.7%, respectively), with both findings having similar prognostic value (hazard ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.60–5.39; and 3.47; 95% CI, 2.42–4.99). When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> findings were stratified as mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal, hazard ratios for events in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s increased proportionally for CTA (2.94, 7.67, 10.13; all <i>P</i><0.001) but not for corresponding functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing categories (0.94 [<i>P</i>=0.87], 2.65 [<i>P</i>=0.001], 3.88 [<i>P</i><0.001]).

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">investig</span></strong>ated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discuss</span></strong> strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

The evolution of fracture clinic design
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fracture clinics are often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>ised by the referral of large   numbers of unselected patients with minor injuries not requiring   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">investig</span></strong>ation or intervention, long waiting times and recurrent   unnecessary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">review</span></strong>s. Our experience had been of an unsustainable   system and we implemented a ‘Trauma Triage Clinic’ (TTC) in order   to rationalise and regulate access to our fracture service.

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong> activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">investig</span></strong>ate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   rotation, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">investig</span></strong>ated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated the femoral rotation and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau. This method <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ates the femur medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   rotation. When sitting cross-legged, femurs displayed internal rotation   from 10° to 100°. From 100°, femoral external rotation was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e kinematic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial pivoting pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°.

Value of Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification for Risk Prediction of Coronary and Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Computed tomography (CT) allows estimation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated several progression algorithms in our unselected, population-based cohort for risk prediction of coronary and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 3281 participants (45–74 years of age), free from cardiovascular disease until the second visit, risk factors, and CTs at baseline (b) and after a mean of 5.1 years (5y) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed. Hard coronary and cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events including revascularization, as well, were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8±2.2 years after the second CT. The added predictive value of 10 CAC progression algorithms on top of risk factors including baseline CAC was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by using survival analysis, C-statistics, net reclassification im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong>ment, and integrated discrimination index. A subgroup analysis of risk in CAC categories was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed 85 (2.6%) hard coronary, 161 (4.9%) hard cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for hard/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive value of baseline CT and risk assessment in terms of C-statistic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong> models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year risk factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and hard/total cardiovascular risk: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively. When CAC<sub>b</sub> progressed from 1 to 399 to CAC<sub>5y</sub>≥400, coronary and total cardiovascular risk were nearly 2-fold in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with subjects who remained below CAC<sub>5y</sub>=400. Participants with CAC<sub>b</sub>≥400 had high rates of hard coronary and hard/total cardiovascular events (10-year risk: 12.0%, 13.5%, and 30.9%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CAC progression is associated with coronary and cardiovascular event rates, but adds only weakly to risk prediction. What counts is the most recent CAC value and risk factor assessment. Therefore, a repeat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong> >5 years after the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong> may be of additional value, except when a double-zero CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong> is present or when the subjects are already at high risk.</p></sec>

Human Plasma Thioredoxin-80 Increases With Age and in ApoE<sup>−/−</sup> Mice Induces Inflammation, Angiogenesis, and Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thioredoxin (TRX)-1, a ubiquitous 12-kDa protein, exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, the truncated form, called TRX80, produced by macrophages induces upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. TRX80 also promotes the differentiation of mouse peritoneal and human macrophages toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRX1 and TRX80 plasma levels were determined with a specific ELISA. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein (ADAM)-10, ADAM-17, and ADAM-10 activities were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with SensoLyte 520 ADAM10 Activity Assay Kit, Fluorimetric, and InnoZyme TACE Activity Kit, respectively. Western immunoblots were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed with specific antibodies to ADAM-10 or ADAM-17. Angiogenesis study was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated in vitro with human microvascular endothelial cells-1 and in vivo with the Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in mice. The expression of macrophage phenotype markers was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">investig</span></strong>ated with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Phosphorylation of Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin, and 70S6K was determined with specific antibodies. The effect of TRX80 on NLRP3 inflammasome activity was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing the level of interleukin-1β and -18 in the supernatants of activated macrophages with ELISA. Hearts were used for lesion surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation and immunohistochemical studies, and whole descending aorta were stained with Oil Red O. For transgenic mice generation, the human scavenger receptor (SR-A) promoter/enhancer was used to drive macrophage-specific expression of human TRX80 in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In this study, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed a significant increase of plasma levels of TRX80 in old subjects compared with healthy young subjects. In parallel, an increase in expression and activity of ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 in old peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with those of young subjects was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed. Furthermore, TRX80 was found to colocalize with tumor necrosis factor-α, a macrophage M1 marker, in human atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, TRX80 induced the expression of murine M1 macrophage markers through Akt2/mechanistic target of rapamycin–C1/70S6K pathway and activated the inflammasome NLRP3, leading to the release of interleukin-1β and -18, potent atherogenic cytokines. Moreover, TRX80 exerts a powerful angiogenic effect in both in vitro and in vivo mouse studies. Finally, transgenic mice that overexpress human TRX80 specifically in macrophages of apoE<sup>−/−</sup> mice have a significant increase of aortic atherosclerotic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TRX80 showed an age-dependent increase in human plasma. In mouse models, TRX80 was associated with a proinflammatory status and increased atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Prognostic Value of Coronary Artery Calcium in the PROMISE Study (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an established predictor of future major adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals. However, limited data exist as to how CAC compares with functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing (FT) in estimating prognosis in symptomatic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain (or dyspnea) and intermediate pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> probability for obstructive coronary artery disease were randomized to FT (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or anatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated those who underwent CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ing as part of the anatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation (n=4209) and compared that with results of FT (n=4602). We stratified CAC and FT results as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal (for CAC: 0, 1–99 Agatston score [AS], 100–400 AS, and >400 AS, respectively; for FT: normal, mild=late positive treadmill, moderate=early positive treadmill or single-vessel ischemia, and severe=large ischemic region abnormality). The primary end point was all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization over a median follow-up of 26.1 months. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and C statistics to determine predictive and discriminatory values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, the distribution of normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> results was significantly different between FT and CAC (FT: normal, n=3588 [78.0%]; mild, n=432 [9.4%]; moderate, n=217 [4.7%]; severe, n=365 [7.9%]; CAC: normal, n=1457 [34.6%]; mild, n=1340 [31.8%]; moderate, n=772 [18.3%]; severe, n=640 [15.2%]; <i>P</i><0.0001). Moderate and severe abnormalities in both arms robustly predicted events (moderate: CAC: HR, 3.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.81–5.44; and FT: HR, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–4.83; severe: CAC: HR, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.99–6.36; and FT: HR, 3.88; 95% confidence interval, 2.58–5.85). In the CAC arm, the majority of events (n=112 of 133, 84%) occurred in patients with any positive CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> (score >0), whereas fewer than half of events occurred in patients with mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal FT (n=57 of 132, 43%; <i>P</i><0.001). In contrast, any abnormality on FT was significantly more specific for predicting events (78.6% for FT versus 35.2% for CAC; <i>P</i><0.001). Overall discriminatory ability in predicting the primary end point of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina hospitalization was similar and fair for both CAC and FT (C statistic, 0.67 versus 0.64).

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>ize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be standardized to take account of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated the time course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–elevation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-risk (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–elevation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed: patients with ST-segment–elevation MI were serially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>ned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>ned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated at all time points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR examinations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference MaR was assessed by contrast-multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>or computed tomography during the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed models were used to take account of repeated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation time in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, edema extent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to values <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by reference contrast-multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>or computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR estimates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–elevation MI edema highlight the need for standardization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a time window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for standardization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

Multimodality Strategy for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment

Tree Physiology
An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">investig</span></strong>ate the effect of the wound healing on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed sap flux with TD probes. The approach was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

Geometric Morphometric Character Suites as Phylogenetic Data: Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Gastropod Shells
<p>Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many of the best represented constituents of the fossil record—including diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks—have mineralized skeletons with limited discrete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>istics, making morphological phylogenies difficult to construct. In contrast to their paucity of phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>s, the mineralized structures (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive shapes that have long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong>d useful for their classification. The recent introduction of methodologies for including continuous data directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>s, making it possible to produce phylogenies based, in whole or part, on continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong> data collected from such taxa. Geometric morphometric methods provide tools for accurately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>izing shape variation and can produce quantitative data that can therefore now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a nonarbitrary manner. Here, the marine gastropod genus <i>Conus</i> is used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the ability of continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>s—generated from a geometric morphometric analysis of shell shape—to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic hypothesis constructed using molecular and morphological data. Furthermore, the ability of continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>s derived from geometric morphometric analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>s into a phylogeny with their extant relatives was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed by simulating the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular partition of individual extant species to produce a “cladistic pseudofossil” with only the geometric morphometric derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>s coded. The phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then compared with its placement in the total evidence tree and a symmetric resampling tree to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ate the degree to which morphometric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>s alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33–45% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> cases (depending upon the approach used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing success), it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>s. This suggests that the incorporation of extinct <i>Conus</i> taxa into phylogenetic hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also has potential to contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions for other major components of the fossil record that lack numerous discrete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>s.

We applied this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>, called CancerSEEK, to 1005 patients with nonmetastatic, clinically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed cancers of the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, lung, or breast. CancerSEEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s were positive in a median of 70% of the eight cancer types. The sensitivities ranged from 69 to 98% for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion of five cancer types (ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, and esophagus) for which there are no screening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>s available for average-risk individuals. The specificity of CancerSEEK was greater than 99%: only 7 of 812 healthy controls scored positive. In addition, CancerSEEK localized the cancer to a small number of anatomic sites in a median of 83% of the patients.</p>

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. Photosynthesis transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed. Reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net photosynthesis, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discuss</span></strong>ed in the context of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely based on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (hazard ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard ratio death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-intensity statins with lower amputation and death risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-intensity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-based study to show that high-intensity statin use at the time of PAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and mortality in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with low-to-moderate–intensity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as well.</p></sec>

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>istics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in <i>BMPR2</i> were identified in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 patients with a clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutation carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be identified reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s suggests the underlying molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s.

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist.

Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a cost per AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of $10 780 (£8255).

The final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of AMI was independently adjudicated using all available clinical and biochemical information without knowledge of cMyC.

Concentrations of cMyC at presentation were significantly higher in those with versus without AMI (median, 237 ng/L versus 13 ng/L, <i>P</i><0.001). Discriminatory power for AMI, as quantified by the area under the receiver-operating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>istic curve (AUC), was comparable for cMyC (AUC, 0.924), hs-cTnT (AUC, 0.927), and hs-cTnI (AUC, 0.922) and superior to cTnI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by a contemporary sensitivity assay (AUC, 0.909). The combination of cMyC with hs-cTnT or standard-sensitivity cTnI (but not hs-cTnI) led to an increase in AUC to 0.931 (<i>P</i><0.0001) and 0.926 (<i>P</i>=0.003), respectively.

The Arabidopsis DNA Methylome Is Stable under Transgenerational Drought Stress
<p>Improving the responsiveness, acclimation, and memory of plants to abiotic stress holds substantive potential for improving agriculture. An unresolved question is the involvement of chromatin marks in the memory of agriculturally relevant stresses. Such potential has spurred numerous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">investig</span></strong>ations yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust stress-induced DNA methylation variation can underpin stress memory. Using a slow-onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">investig</span></strong>ated the malleability of the DNA methylome to drought stress within a generation and under repeated drought stress over five successive generations. While drought-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed within a generation, they did not correlate with drought-responsive gene expression. Six traits were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed for transgenerational stress memory, and the descendants of drought-stressed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one generation removed from stress. With respect to transgenerational drought stress, there were negligible conserved differentially methylated regions in drought-exposed lineages compared with unstressed lineages. Instead, the majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed variation was tied to stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the experience of repeated drought stress was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed to influence transgenerational epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that, while transgenerational memory is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed in one of six traits examined, they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to drought stress.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and network inference were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ated. A comprehensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed. The three normalization methods had very similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ance. For network inference, correlation methods <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN.

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong>ed the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of seed traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, seed mass is generally regarded to be key for seedling development but is mostly approximated by using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>ning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed seed size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single seeds, are very rarely determined in routine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i>Seeder, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual seeds of very different sizes. The system consists of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed for individual seeds are two-dimensional data from projections, three-dimensional data from volumetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es, and mass, from which seed density is also calculated. Each seed is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation or processing (e.g. in routine seed-to-plant tracking pipelines). By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">investig</span></strong>ating seeds of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed that, even for apparently round-shaped seeds of rapeseed, correlations between the projected area and the mass of seeds were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for seed mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated seed phenotyping on a single-seed basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including seed classification, seed sorting, and assessment of seed quality.</p>

Trans-generational plasticity in physiological thermal tolerance is modulated by maternal pre-reproductive environment in the polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i>
<p>Maternal temperature is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its effect on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with temperature changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">investig</span></strong>ate the influence of maternal temperature on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30°C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24°C and then exposed to 18 or 30°C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24°C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother–offspring temperatures did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed when temperatures persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30°C may have benefited offspring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ance when mother–offspring environments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-generational effect of temperature on physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">perform</span></strong>ance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">character</span></strong>ised by a high context dependency, and are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discuss</span></strong>ed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences.</p>

The limits of applicability of the sound exposure level (SEL) metric to temporal threshold shifts (TTS) in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>The influence of fatiguing sound level and duration on post-exposure temporary threshold shift (TTS) was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">investig</span></strong>ated in two beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The fatiguing sound was half-octave noise with a center frequency of 22.5 kHz. TTS was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> frequency of 32 kHz. Thresholds were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by recording rhythmic evoked potentials (the envelope following response) to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">test</span></strong> series of short (eight cycles) tone pips with a pip rate of 1000 s<sup>−1</sup>. TTS increased approximately proportionally to the dB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of both sound pressure (sound pressure level, SPL) and duration of the fatiguing noise, as a product of these two variables. In particular, when the noise parameters varied in a manner that maintained the product of squared sound pressure and time (sound exposure level, SEL, which is equivalent to the overall noise energy) at a constant level, TTS was not constant. Keeping SEL constant, the highest TTS appeared at an intermediate ratio of SPL to sound duration and decreased at both higher and lower ratios. Multiplication (SPL multiplied by log duration) better described the experimental data than an equal-energy (equal SEL) model. The use of SEL as a sole universal metric may result in an implausible assessment of the impact of a fatiguing sound on hearing thresholds in odontocetes, including under-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of potential risks.</p>

Impact of Bystander Automated External Defibrillator Use on Survival and Functional Outcomes in Shockable Observed Public Cardiac Arrests

Although shockable OHCA accounts for only ≈25% of overall arrests, ≈60% of public OHCAs are shockable, offering the possibility of restoring thousands of individuals to full recovery with early defibrillation by bystanders. We sought to determine the association of bystander automated external defibrillator use with survival and functional outcomes in shockable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed public OHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium prospectively collected detailed information on all cardiac arrests at 9 regional centers.

The primary outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e was discharge with normal or near-normal (favorable) functional status defined as a modified Rankin Score ≤2. Survival to hospital discharge was the secondary outcome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 49 555 OHCAs, 4115 (8.3%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">observ</span></strong>ed public OHCAs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed, of which 2500 (60.8%) were shockable. A bystander shock was applied in 18.8% of the shockable arrests. Patients shocked by a bystander were significantly more likely to survive to discharge (66.5% versus 43.0%) and be discharged with favorable functional outcome (57.1% versus 32.7%) than patients initially shocked by emergency medical services. After adjusting for known predictors of outcome, the odds ratio associated with a bystander shock was 2.62 (95% confidence interval, 2.07–3.31) for survival to hospital discharge and 2.73 (95% confidence interval, 2.17–3.44) for discharge with favorable functional outcome.

Latent Rheumatic Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Screening echocardiography has emerged as a potentially powerful tool for early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s of rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The utility of screening echocardiography hinges on the rate of RHD progression and the ability of penicillin prophylaxis to im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong> outcome. We report the longitudinal outcomes of a cohort of children with latent RHD and identify risk factors for unfavorable outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective natural history study conducted under the Ugandan RHD registry. Children with latent RHD and ≥1 year of follow-up were included. All echocardiograms were re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">review</span></strong>ed by experts (2012 World Heart Federation criteria) for inclusion and evidence of change. Bi- and multivariable logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox proportional hazards models, as well, were developed to search for risk factors for unfavorable outcome and compare progression-free survival between those treated and not treated with penicillin. Propensity and other matching methods with sensitivity analysis were implemented for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evalu</span></strong>ation of the penicillin effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">review</span></strong> confirmed 227 cases of latent RHD: 164 borderline and 63 definite (42 mild, 21 moderate/severe). Median age at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s was 12 years and median follow-up was 2.3 years (interquartile range, 2.0–2.9). Penicillin prophylaxis was prescribed in 49.3% with overall adherence of 84.7%. Of children with moderate-to-severe definite RHD, 47.6% had echocardiographic progression (including 2 deaths), and 9.5% had echocardiographic regression. Children with mild definite and borderline RHD showed 26% and 9.8% echocardiographic progression and 45.2% and 46.3% echocardiographic im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prove</span></strong>ment, respectively. Of those with mild definite RHD or borderline RHD, more advanced disease category, younger age, and morphological mitral valve features were risk factors for an unfavorable outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Latent RHD is a heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s with variable disease outcomes. Children with moderate to severe latent RHD have poor outcomes. Children with both borderline and mild definite RHD are at substantial risk of progression. Although long-term outcome remains unclear, the initial change in latent RHD may be evident during the first 1 to 2 years following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diagnosi</span></strong>s. Natural history data are inherently limited, and a randomized clinical trial is needed to definitively determine the impact of penicillin prophylaxis on the trajectory of latent RHD.</p></sec>

Cancer-associated arginine-to-histidine mutations confer a gain in pH sensing to mutant proteins
<p>The intracellular pH (pHi) of most cancers is constitutively higher than that of normal cells and enhances proliferation and cell survival. We found that increased pHi enabled the tumorigenic behaviors caused by somatic arginine-to-histidine mutations, which are frequent in cancer and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> pH sensing not seen with wild-type proteins. Experimentally raising the pHi increased the activity of R776H mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-R776H), thereby increasing proliferation and causing transformation in fibroblasts. An Arg-to-Gly mutation did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> these effects. Molecular dynamics simulations of EGFR suggested that decreased protonation of His<sup>776</sup> at high pH causes conformational changes in the αC helix that may stabilize the active form of the kinase. An Arg-to-His, but not Arg-to-Lys, mutation in the transcription factor p53 (p53-R273H) decreased its transcriptional activity and attenuated the DNA damage response in fibroblasts and breast cancer cells with high pHi. Lowering pHi attenuated the tumorigenic effects of both EGFR-R776H and p53-R273H. Our data suggest that some somatic mutations may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> a fitness advantage to the higher pHi of cancer cells.</p>

‘Ending AIDS’ movement falters worldwide
<p>A campaign to end AIDS by 2030, led by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), is badly off track. This became abundantly clear at the International AIDS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>ence held in Amsterdam last week. The campaign rests on a mathematical model that says that treatment levels are high enough, the epidemic will peter out because people who fully suppress their virus rarely infect others. Although 21.7 million of the 36.9 million HIV-infected people in the world now receive antiretrovirals, too few countries have met treatment targets. Indeed, nearly 2 million people became infected last year, and to meet UNAIDS benchmarks for ending AIDS, that number would have to drop to 500,000 by 2020, which now seems highly unlikely. But there was good news at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>ence, too: The few countries that have met the targets, including Namibia and Botswana, have seen big drops in new infections, as the mathematical model predicted. And one study hammered in the point that effective treatment essentially eliminates the risk of an infected person transmitting the virus to others.</p>

Epigenetic regulation of antagonistic receptors confers rice blast resistance with yield balance
<p>Crop breeding aims to balance disease resistance with yield; however, single resistance (R) genes can lead to resistance breakdown, and R gene pyramiding may affect growth fitness. Here we report that the rice <i>Pigm</i> locus contains a cluster of genes encoding nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> durable resistance to the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> without yield penalty. Among these NLR receptors, PigmR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>s broad-spectrum resistance, whereas PigmS competitively attenuates PigmR homodimerization to suppress resistance. <i>PigmS</i> expression, and thus <i>PigmR</i>-mediated resistance, are subjected to tight epigenetic regulation. <i>PigmS</i> increases seed production to counteract the yield cost induced by <i>PigmR</i>. Therefore, our study reveals a mechanism balancing high disease resistance and yield through epigenetic regulation of paired antagonistic NLR receptors, providing a tool to develop elite crop varieties.</p>

Laccase GhLac1 Modulates Broad-Spectrum Biotic Stress Tolerance via Manipulating Phenylpropanoid Pathway and Jasmonic Acid Synthesis
<p>Plants are constantly challenged by a multitude of pathogens and pests, which causes massive yield and quality losses annually. A promising approach to reduce such losses is to enhance the immune system of plants through genetic engineering. Previous work has shown that laccases (p-diphenol:dioxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.2) function as lignin polymerization enzymes. Here we demonstrate that transgenic manipulation of the expression of the laccase gene <i>GhLac1</i> in cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> an enhanced defense response to both pathogens and pests. Overexpression of <i>GhLac1</i> leads to increased lignification, associated with increased tolerance to the fungal pathogen <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> and to the insect pests cotton bollworm (<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>) and cotton aphid (<i>Aphis gosypii</i>). Suppression of <i>GhLac1</i> expression leads to a redirection of metabolic flux in the phenylpropanoid pathway, causing the accumulation of JA and secondary metabolites that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> and cotton bollworm; it also leads to increased susceptibility to cotton aphid. Plant laccases therefore provide a new molecular tool to engineer pest and pathogen resistance in crops.</p>

Multifunctional RNA Binding Protein OsTudor-SN in Storage Protein mRNA Transport and Localization
<p>The multifunctional RNA-binding protein Tudor-SN plays multiple roles in transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes due to its modular domain structure, consisting of four tandem <i>Staphylococcus</i> nuclease (SN)-like domains (4SN), followed by a carboxyl-terminal Tudor domain, followed by a fifth partial SN sequence (Tsn). In plants, it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>s stress tolerance, is a component of stress granules and P-bodies, and may participate in stabilizing and localizing RNAs to specific subdomains of the cortical-endoplasmic reticulum in developing rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm. Here, we show that, in addition to the intact rice OsTudor-SN protein, the 4SN and Tsn modules exist as independent polypeptides, which collectively may coassemble to form a complex population of homodimer and heteroduplex species. The 4SN and Tsn modules exhibit different roles in RNA binding and as a protein scaffold for stress-associated proteins and RNA-binding proteins. Despite their distinct individual properties, mutations in both the 4SN and Tsn modules mislocalize storage protein mRNAs to the cortical endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that the two modular peptide regions of OsTudor-SN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> different cellular properties but cooperate in mRNA localization, a process linking its multiple functions in the nucleus and cytoplasm.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA proteins that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA proteins are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA proteins are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA proteins map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA proteins are much larger than the bacterial BcsA protein, prompting the suggestion that these plant-specific regions are important for interactions between CESA proteins and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>ring CESA class specificity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA proteins, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA proteins and hence what determines the specificity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class specificity extends throughout the protein and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site specificity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>ring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to observe an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental population genetic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding mutations including common mutations outside the <i>kelch13</i> propeller associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. Mutations were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of mutation and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid mutations <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> resistance providing a large mutational target—we estimate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population mutation parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be estimated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> estimated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously underestimated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may underestimate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously estimated.</p>

Fitness Trade-Offs Lead to Suppressor Tolerance in Yeast
<p>Genetic variation among individuals within a population provides the raw material for phenotypic diversity upon which natural selection operates. Some given variants can act on multiple standing genomic variations simultaneously and release previously inaccessible phenotypes, leading to increased adaptive potential upon challenging environments. Previously, we identified such a variant related to a tRNA nonsense suppressor in yeast. When introduced into other genetic backgrounds, the suppressor led to an increased population phenotypic variance on various culture conditions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>ring background and environment specific selective advantages. Nonetheless, most isolates are intolerant to the suppressor on rich media due to a severe fitness cost. Here, we found that the tolerance to suppressor is related to a surprising level of fitness outburst, showing a trade-off effect to accommodate the cost of carrying the suppressor. To dissect the genetic basis of such trade-offs, we crossed strains with contrasting tolerance levels on rich media, and analyzed the fitness distribution patterns in the offspring. Combining quantitative tetrad analysis and bulk segregant analysis, we identified two genes, namely <i>MKT1</i> and <i>RGA1</i>, involved in suppressor tolerance. We showed that alleles from the tolerant parent for both genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>red a significant gain of fitness, which increased the suppressor tolerance. Our results present a detailed dissection of suppressor tolerance in yeast and provide insights into the molecular basis of trade-offs between fitness and evolutionary potential.</p>

A Histone Code Reader and a Transcriptional Activator Interact to Regulate Genes for Salt Tolerance
<p>Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins are involved in various developmental processes and stress responses. They recognize and bind to epigenetically modified histone H3 tail and function as histone code readers. Here we report that GmPHD6 reads low methylated histone H3K4me0/1/2 but not H3K4me3 with its N-terminal domain instead of the PHD finger. GmPHD6 does not possess transcriptional regulatory ability but has DNA-binding ability. Through the PHD finger, GmPHD6 interacts with its coactivator, LHP1-1/2, to form a transcriptional activation complex. Using a transgenic hairy root system, we demonstrate that overexpression of <i>GmPHD6</i> improves stress tolerance in soybean (<i>Glycine</i> <i>max</i>) plants. Knocking down the <i>LHP1</i> expression disrupts this role of <i>GmPHD6</i>, indicating that GmPHD6 requires LHP1 functions during stress response. GmPHD6 influences expression of dozens of stress-related genes. Among these, we identified three targets of GmPHD6, including ABA-stress-ripening-induced <i>CYP75B1</i> and <i>CYP82C4</i>. Overexpression of each gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>s stress tolerance in soybean plants. GmPHD6 is recruited to H3K4me0/1/2 marks and recognizes the G-rich elements in target gene promoters, whereas LHP1 activates expression of these targets. Our study reveals a mechanism involving two partners in a complex. Manipulation of the genes in this pathway should improve stress tolerance in soybean or other legumes/crops.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of gene expression, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) genes on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these gene families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the genetic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> genes moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>red resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> genes, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> genes cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream gene transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

The Chickpea <i>Early Flowering 1</i> (<i>Efl1</i>) Locus Is an Ortholog of Arabidopsis <i>ELF3</i>
<p>In climates that experience short growing seasons due to drought, heat, or end-of-season frost, early flowering is a highly desirable trait for chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). In this study, we mapped, sequenced, and characterized <i>Early flowering3</i> (<i>Efl3</i>), an ortholog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>s early flowering in chickpea. In a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between CDC Frontier and ICCV 96029, this gene was mapped to the site of a quantitative trait locus on Ca5 that explained 59% of flowering time variation under short days. Sequencing of <i>ELF3</i> in ICCV 96029 revealed an 11-bp deletion in the first exon that was predicted to result in a premature stop codon. The effect of this mutation was tested by transgenic complementation in the Arabidopsis <i>elf3-1</i> mutant, with the CDC Frontier form of <i>CaELF3a</i> partially complementing <i>elf3-1</i> while the ICCV 96029 form had no effect on flowering time. While induction of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> homologs was very early in ICCV 96029, an analysis of circadian clock function failed to show any clear loss of rhythm in the expression of clock genes in ICCV 96029 grown under continuous light, suggesting redundancy with other <i>ELF3</i> homologs or possibly an alternative mode of action for this gene in chickpea. The 11-bp deletion was associated with early flowering in global chickpea germplasm but was not widely distributed, indicating that this mutation arose relatively recently.</p>

Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its concentration gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (trapped), thus raising total phloem sugar concentration to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>red by both of these symplastic-loading processes. Here, we present an integrated model—including local and global transport and kinetics of polymerization—for passive and active symplastic loading. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to passive loading, polymerization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates export for a given concentration of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of active and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

Sequence Exchange between Homologous NB-LRR Genes Converts Virus Resistance into Nematode Resistance, and Vice Versa
<p>Plants have evolved a limited repertoire of NB-LRR disease resistance (<i>R</i>) genes to protect themselves against myriad pathogens. This limitation is thought to be counterbalanced by the rapid evolution of NB-LRR proteins, as only a few sequence changes have been shown to be sufficient to alter resistance specificities toward novel strains of a pathogen. However, little is known about the flexibility of NB-LRR <i>R</i> genes to switch resistance specificities between phylogenetically unrelated pathogens. To investigate this, we created domain swaps between the close homologs <i>Gpa2</i> and <i>Rx1</i>, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> resistance in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) to the cyst nematode <i>Globodera pallida</i> and <i>Potato virus X</i>, respectively. The genetic fusion of the CC-NB-ARC of Gpa2 with the LRR of Rx1 (Gpa2<sub>CN</sub>/Rx1<sub>L</sub>) results in autoactivity, but lowering the protein levels restored its specific activation response, including extreme resistance to <i>Potato virus X</i> in potato shoots. The reciprocal chimera (Rx1<sub>CN</sub>/Gpa2<sub>L</sub>) shows a loss-of-function phenotype, but exchange of the first three LRRs of Gpa2 by the corresponding region of Rx1 was sufficient to regain a wild-type resistance response to <i>G. pallida</i> in the roots. These data demonstrate that exchanging the recognition moiety in the LRR is sufficient to convert extreme virus resistance in the leaves into mild nematode resistance in the roots, and vice versa. In addition, we show that the CC-NB-ARC can operate independently of the recognition specificities defined by the LRR domain, either aboveground or belowground. These data show the versatility of NB-LRR genes to generate resistance to unrelated pathogens with completely different lifestyles and routes of invasion.</p>

The PEX1 ATPase Stabilizes PEX6 and Plays Essential Roles in Peroxisome Biology
<p>A variety of metabolic pathways are sequestered in peroxisomes, conserved organelles that are essential for human and plant survival. Peroxin (PEX) proteins generate and maintain peroxisomes. The PEX1 ATPase facilitates recycling of the peroxisome matrix protein receptor PEX5 and is the most commonly affected peroxin in human peroxisome biogenesis disorders. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of, to our knowledge, the first Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>pex1</i> missense alleles: <i>pex1-2</i> and <i>pex1-3</i>. <i>pex1-2</i> displayed peroxisome-related defects accompanied by reduced PEX1 and PEX6 levels. These <i>pex1-2</i> defects were exacerbated by growth at high temperature and ameliorated by growth at low temperature or by <i>PEX6</i> overexpression, suggesting that PEX1 enhances PEX6 stability and vice versa. <i>pex1-3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>red embryo lethality when homozygous, confirming that PEX1, like several other Arabidopsis peroxins, is essential for embryogenesis. <i>pex1-3</i> displayed symptoms of peroxisome dysfunction when heterozygous; this semidominance is consistent with PEX1 forming a heterooligomer with PEX6 that is poisoned by pex1-3 subunits. Blocking autophagy partially rescued <i>PEX1</i>/<i>pex1-3</i> defects, including the restoration of normal peroxisome size, suggesting that increasing peroxisome abundance can compensate for the deficiencies caused by <i>pex1-3</i> and that the enlarged peroxisomes visible in <i>PEX1</i>/<i>pex1-3</i> may represent autophagy intermediates. Overexpressing <i>PEX1</i> in wild-type plants impaired growth, suggesting that excessive PEX1 can be detrimental. Our genetic, molecular, and physiological data support the heterohexamer model of PEX1-PEX6 function in plants.</p>

In Vitro Characterization of Thermostable CAM Rubisco Activase Reveals a Rubisco Interacting Surface Loop
<p>To maintain metabolic flux through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in higher plants, dead-end inhibited complexes of Rubisco must constantly be engaged and remodeled by the molecular chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca). In C3 plants, the thermolability of Rca is responsible for the deactivation of Rubisco and reduction of photosynthesis at moderately elevated temperatures. We reasoned that crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants must possess thermostable Rca to support Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle flux during the day when stomata are closed. A comparative biochemical characterization of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Agave tequilana</i> Rca isoforms demonstrated that the CAM Rca isoforms are approximately10°C more thermostable than the C3 isoforms. Agave Rca also possessed a much higher in vitro biochemical activity, even at low assay temperatures. Mixtures of rice and agave Rca form functional hetero-oligomers in vitro, but only the rice isoforms denature at nonpermissive temperatures. The high thermostability and activity of agave Rca mapped to the N-terminal 244 residues. A Glu-217-Gln amino acid substitution was found to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> high Rca activity to rice Rca. Further mutational analysis suggested that Glu-217 restricts the flexibility of the α4-β4 surface loop that interacts with Rubisco via Lys-216. CAM plants thus promise to be a source of highly functional, thermostable Rca candidates for thermal fortification of crop photosynthesis. Careful characterization of their properties will likely reveal further protein-protein interaction motifs to enrich our mechanistic model of Rca function.</p>

A Novel N-Methyltransferase in Arabidopsis Appears to Feed a Conserved Pathway for Nicotinate Detoxification among Land Plants and Is Associated with Lignin Biosynthesis
<p>The Preiss-Handler pathway, which salvages nicotinate (NA) for NAD synthesis, is an indispensable biochemical pathway in land plants. Various NA conjugations (mainly methylation and glycosylation) have been detected and have long been proposed for NA detoxification in plants. Previously, we demonstrated that NA <i>O</i>-glucosylation functions as a mobilizable storage form for NAD biosynthesis in the Brassicaceae. However, little is known about the functions of other NA conjugations in plants. In this study, we first found that <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate is a ubiquitous NA conjugation in land plants. Furthermore, we functionally identified a novel methyltransferase (At3g53140; NA<i>N</i>MT), which is mainly responsible for <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate formation, from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We also established that trigonelline is a detoxification form of endogenous NA in plants. Combined phylogenetic analysis and enzymatic assays revealed that NA <i>N</i>-methylation activity was likely derived from the duplication and subfunctionalization of an ancestral caffeic acid <i>O</i>-methyltransferase (<i>COMT</i>) gene in the course of land plant evolution. COMT enzymes, which function in <i>S</i>-lignin biosynthesis, also have weak NA<i>N</i>MT activity. Our data suggest that NA detoxification <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>red by NA<i>N</i>MT and COMT might have facilitated the retention of the Preiss-Handler pathway in land plants.</p>

<i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> Encode Putative H3K4 Methyltransferases and Are Critical for Plant Development
<p>Methylation of Lys residues in the tail of the H3 histone is a key regulator of chromatin state and gene expression, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>red by a large family of enzymes containing an evolutionarily conserved SET domain. One of the main types of SET domain proteins are those controlling H3K4 di- and trimethylation. The genome of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes 12 such proteins, including five ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX (ATX) proteins and seven ATX-Related proteins. Here, we examined three until-now-unexplored ATX proteins, ATX3, ATX4, and ATX5. We found that they exhibit similar domain structures and expression patterns and are redundantly required for vegetative and reproductive development. Concurrent disruption of the <i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> genes caused marked reduction in H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels genome-wide and resulted in thousands of genes expressed ectopically. Furthermore, <i>atx3</i>/<i>atx4</i>/<i>atx5</i> triple mutants resulted in exaggerated phenotypes when combined with the <i>atx2</i> mutant but not with <i>atx1</i>. Together, we conclude that <i>ATX3</i>, <i>ATX4</i>, and <i>ATX5</i> are redundantly required for H3K4 di- and trimethylation at thousands of sites located across the genome, and genomic features associated with targeted regions are different from the <i>ATXR3</i>/<i>SDG2</i>-controlled sites in Arabidopsis.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p>Metal accumulation in seeds is a prerequisite for germination and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate metal transport processes and their interactions in seeds, we focused on METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast transporter of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 transports Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe transport function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe transport. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjecting seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>red Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this transporter plays an important role in the generation of seed metal stores as well as for metal homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

Reconstitution of Abscisic Acid Signaling from the Receptor to DNA via bHLH Transcription Factors
<p>The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>s drought tolerance in plants through stomatal closure and regulation of gene expression. The complex consisting of the ABA receptor PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE/REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTOR (PYR/RCAR), type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C), and SNF1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) has a key role in ABA signaling. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator ABA-RESPONSIVE KINASE SUBSTRATE1 (AKS1, also known as FBH3) is released from DNA by phosphorylation-induced monomerization in response to ABA in guard cells. Here we reconstituted the release of AKS1 from DNA via the ABA signaling core complex in vitro. We first obtained evidence to confirm that AKS1 is an endogenous substrate for SnRK2s. Phosphorylation of AKS1 and activation of SnRK2 showed the same time course in response to ABA in guard cells. AKS1 was bound to SnRK2.6 in vivo. Three ABA-responsive SnRK2s (SnRK2.2/SRK2D, SnRK2.3/SRK2I, and SnRK2.6/SRK2E/OST1) phosphorylated AKS1 in vitro, and the phosphorylation was eliminated by the triple mutation of SnRK2s in plants. We reconstituted the AKS1 phosphorylation in vitro via the signaling complex containing the ABA receptor PYR1, a PP2C, HYPERSENSITIVE TO ABA1 (HAB1), and a protein kinase, SnRK2.6 in response to ABA. We further reconstituted the release of AKS1 from the target gene of <i>POTASSIUM CHANNEL IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 1</i> (<i>KAT1</i>) via the complex in response to ABA. These results demonstrate that AKS1 provides a link between the signaling complex and ABA-responsive genes and furnish evidence for a minimal signaling mechanism from ABA perception to DNA.</p>

Photosynthetic Trichomes Contain a Specific Rubisco with a Modified pH-Dependent Activity
<p>Ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) is the most abundant enzyme in plants and is responsible for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation during photosynthesis. This enzyme is assembled from eight large subunits (RbcL) encoded by a single chloroplast gene and eight small subunits (RbcS) encoded by a nuclear gene family. Rubisco is primarily found in the chloroplasts of mesophyll (C3 plants), bundle-sheath (C4 plants), and guard cells. In certain species, photosynthesis also takes place in the secretory cells of glandular trichomes, which are epidermal outgrowths (hairs) involved in the secretion of specialized metabolites. However, photosynthesis and, in particular, Rubisco have not been characterized in trichomes. Here, we show that tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) trichomes contain a specific Rubisco small subunit, NtRbcS-T, which belongs to an uncharacterized phylogenetic cluster (T). This cluster contains RbcS from at least 33 species, including monocots, many of which are known to possess glandular trichomes. Cluster T is distinct from the cluster M, which includes the abundant, functionally characterized RbcS isoforms expressed in mesophyll or bundle-sheath cells. Expression of NtRbcS-T in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> and purification of the full Rubisco complex showed that this isoform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>red higher <i>V</i><sub>max</sub> and <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> values as well as higher acidic pH-dependent activity than NtRbcS-M, an isoform expressed in the mesophyll. This observation was confirmed with trichome extracts. These data show that an ancient divergence allowed for the emergence of a so-far-uncharacterized RbcS cluster. We propose that secretory trichomes have a particular Rubisco uniquely adapted to secretory cells where CO<sub>2</sub> is released by the active specialized metabolism.</p>

Antiviral Resistance Protein Tm-2<sup>2</sup> Functions on the Plasma Membrane
<p>The tomato <i>Tobacco mosaic virus resistance-2<sup>2</sup></i> (<i>Tm-2<sup>2</sup></i>) gene encodes a coiled-coil-nucleotide binding site-Leu-rich repeat protein lacking a conventional plasma membrane (PM) localization motif.

We show that both inactive and active Tm-2<sup>2</sup> proteins are localized to the PM. When restricted to PM by fusing Tm-2<sup>2</sup> to the <i>S</i>-acylated PM association motif, the Tm-2<sup>2</sup> fusion protein can still induce a hypersensitive response cell death, consistent with its activation at the PM. Through analyses of viral MP mutants, we find that the plasmodesmata (PD) localization of the Avr protein MP is not required for Tm-2<sup>2</sup> function. These results suggest that Tm-2<sup>2</sup>-mediated resistance takes place on PM without requirement of its Avr protein to be located to PD.</p>

A 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase Mediates the Biosynthesis of Glucoraphasatin in Radish
<p>Glucosinolates (GSLs) are secondary metabolites whose degradation products <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> intrinsic flavors and aromas to Brassicaceae vegetables. Several structures of GSLs are known in the Brassicaceae, and the biosynthetic pathway and regulatory networks have been elucidated in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). GSLs are precursors of chemical defense substances against herbivorous pests. Specific GSLs can act as feeding blockers or stimulants, depending on the pest species. Natural selection has led to diversity in the GSL composition even within individual species. However, in radish (<i>Raphanus sativus</i>), glucoraphasatin (4-methylthio-3-butenyl glucosinolate) accounts for more than 90% of the total GSLs, and little compositional variation is observed. Because glucoraphasatin is not contained in other members of the Brassicaceae, like Arabidopsis and cabbage (<i>Brassica oleracea</i>), the biosynthetic pathways for glucoraphasatin remain unclear. In this report, we identified and characterized a gene encoding GLUCORAPHASATIN SYNTHASE 1 (GRS1) by genetic mapping using a mutant that genetically lacks glucoraphasatin. Transgenic Arabidopsis, which overexpressed <i>GRS1</i> cDNA, accumulated glucoraphasatin in the leaves. <i>GRS1</i> encodes a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, and it is abundantly expressed in the leaf. To further investigate the biosynthesis and transportation of GSLs in radish, we grafted a <i>grs1</i> plant onto a wild-type plant. The grafting experiment revealed a leaf-to-root long-distance glucoraphasatin transport system in radish and showed that the composition of GSLs differed among the organs. Based on these observations, we propose a characteristic biosynthesis pathway for glucoraphasatin in radish. Our results should be useful in metabolite engineering for breeding of high-value vegetables.</p>

Transcription Factors PvERF15 and PvMTF-1 Form a Cadmium Stress Transcriptional Pathway
<p>In plants, cadmium (Cd)-responsive transcription factors are key downstream effectors of Cd stress transcriptional pathways, which are capable of converging Cd stress signals through triggering the expression of Cd detoxification genes. However, the upstream transcriptional regulatory pathways that modulate their responses to Cd are less clear. Previously, we identified the bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) METAL RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (PvMTF-1) that responds to Cd and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>s Cd tolerance in planta. Here, we demonstrate an upstream transcriptional regulation of the <i>PvMTF-1</i> response to Cd. Using a yeast one-hybrid system, we cloned the bean ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR15 (PvERF15) that binds to the <i>PvMTF-1</i> promoter. <i>PvERF15</i> was strongly induced by Cd stress, and its overexpression resulted in the up-regulation of <i>PvMTF-1</i>. DNA-protein interaction assays further revealed that PvERF15 binds directly to a 19-bp AC-rich element in the <i>PvMTF-1</i> promoter. The AC-rich element serves as a positive element bound by PvERF15 to activate gene expression. More importantly, knockdown of <i>PvERF15</i> by RNA interference resulted in reduced Cd-induced expression of <i>PvMTF-1</i>. <i>PvERF15</i> seems to be involved in Cd tolerance, since knockdown of <i>PvERF15</i> by RNA interference in bean leaf discs decreased Cd tolerance in a transient assay. Since PvERF15 is a component of the Cd stress transcriptional pathway in beans and <i>PvMTF-1</i> is one of its downstream targets, our findings provide a PvERF15/PvMTF-1 transcriptional pathway and thereby contribute to the understanding of Cd stress transcriptional regulatory pathways in plants.</p>

Structural and Biochemical Characterization of Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductases
<p>Cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase (CCR) catalyzes the reduction of hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) esters using NADPH to produce hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde precursors in lignin synthesis. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of cinnamoyl-CoA reductases from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. Although SbCCR1 displayed higher affinity for caffeoyl-CoA or <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than for feruloyl-CoA, the enzyme showed significantly higher activity for the latter substrate. Through molecular docking and comparisons between the crystal structures of the <i>Vitis vinifera</i> dihydroflavonol reductase and SbCCR1, residues threonine-154 and tyrosine-310 were pinpointed as being involved in binding CoA-conjugated phenylpropanoids. Threonine-154 of SbCCR1 and other CCRs likely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>s strong substrate specificity for feruloyl-CoA over other cinnamoyl-CoA thioesters, and the T154Y mutation in SbCCR1 led to broader substrate specificity and faster turnover.

One of these, SbCCR2, displayed greater activity toward <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than did SbCCR1, which could imply a role in the synthesis of defense-related lignin. Taken together, these findings provide knowledge about critical residues and substrate preference among CCRs and provide, to our knowledge, the first three-dimensional structure information for a CCR from a monocot species.</p>

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA or auxin) mediates the elongation growth of shoot tissues by promoting cell expansion. According to the acid growth theory proposed in the 1970s, auxin activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and promoting solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that auxin-induced <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote elongation growth and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>s the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment elongation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical properties, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of auxin-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of auxin for elongation growth by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are specifically impaired in auxin-mediated elongation. The time courses of auxin-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and auxin-dependent elongation growth were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit auxin-mediated expansion growth by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also binds with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> channels already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which assembles with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, binds to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> channel via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to channel-gating control. Binding to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed channel gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>red specificity on VAMP721 binding without influencing gating. Channel binding was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this structure when not assembled with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed channel binding and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two channel-binding sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex assembly, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that binding begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> channel gating during SNARE assembly and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> channels are nucleation points for SNARE complex assembly.</p>

To investigate SlCipk6-induced molecular mechanisms and identify putative substrates, a yeast two-hybrid approach was carried on and a protein was identified that contained a Universal stress protein (Usp) domain present in bacteria, protozoa and plants, which we named “SlRd2”. SlRd2 was an ATP-binding protein that formed homodimers in planta. SlCipk6 and SlRd2 interacted using coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves and the complex localized in the cytosol.

Cell-Type-Specific H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Activity in Root Tissues Enables K<sup>+</sup> Retention and Mediates Acclimation of Barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to Salinity Stress
<p>While the importance of cell type specificity in plant adaptive responses is widely accepted, only a limited number of studies have addressed this issue at the functional level. We have combined electrophysiological, imaging, and biochemical techniques to reveal the physiological mechanisms <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>ring higher sensitivity of apical root cells to salinity in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). We show that salinity application to the root apex arrests root growth in a highly tissue- and treatment-specific manner. Although salinity-induced transient net Na<sup>+</sup> uptake was about 4-fold higher in the root apex compared with the mature zone, mature root cells accumulated more cytosolic and vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>, suggesting that the higher sensitivity of apical cells to salt is not related to either enhanced Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion or sequestration inside the root. Rather, the above differential sensitivity between the two zones originates from a 10-fold difference in K<sup>+</sup> efflux between the mature zone and the apical region (much poorer in the root apex) of the root. Major factors contributing to this poor K<sup>+</sup> retention ability are (1) an intrinsically lower H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity in the root apex, (2) greater salt-induced membrane depolarization, and (3) a higher reactive oxygen species production under NaCl and a larger density of reactive oxygen species-activated cation currents in the apex. Salinity treatment increased (2- to 5-fold) the content of 10 (out of 25 detected) amino acids in the root apex but not in the mature zone and changed the organic acid and sugar contents. The causal link between the observed changes in the root metabolic profile and the regulation of transporter activity is discussed.</p>

Apparent Overinvestment in Leaf Venation Relaxes Leaf Morphological Constraints on Photosynthesis in Arid Habitats
<p>Leaf veins supply the mesophyll with water that evaporates when stomata are open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Theoretical analyses suggest that water is optimally distributed in the mesophyll when the lateral distance between veins (<i>d</i><sub>x</sub>) is equal to the distance from these veins to the epidermis (<i>d</i><sub>y</sub>), expressed as <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ≈ 1. Although this theory is supported by observations of many derived angiosperms, we hypothesize that plants in arid environments may reduce <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> below unity owing to climate-specific functional adaptations of increased leaf thickness and increased vein density. To test our hypothesis, we assembled leaf hydraulic, morphological, and photosynthetic traits of 68 species from the <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Corymbia</i> genera (termed eucalypts) along an aridity gradient in southwestern Australia. We inferred the potential gas-exchange advantage of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> using a model that links leaf morphology and hydraulics to photosynthesis. Our observations reveal that eucalypts in arid environments have thick amphistomatous leaves with high vein densities, resulting in <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ratios that range from 1.6 to 0.15 along the aridity gradient. Our model suggests that, as leaves become thicker, the effect of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> is to offset the reduction in leaf gas exchange that would result from maintaining <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> at unity. This apparent overinvestment in leaf venation may be explained from the selective pressure of aridity, under which traits associated with long leaf life span, high hydraulic and thermal capacitances, and high potential rates of leaf water transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> a competitive advantage.</p>

Genetic Interactions between PEROXIN12 and Other Peroxisome-Associated Ubiquitination Components
<p>Most eukaryotic cells require peroxisomes, organelles housing fatty acid β-oxidation and other critical metabolic reactions. Peroxisomal matrix proteins carry peroxisome-targeting signals that are recognized by one of two receptors, PEX5 or PEX7, in the cytosol. After delivering the matrix proteins to the organelle, these receptors are removed from the peroxisomal membrane or matrix. Receptor retrotranslocation not only facilitates further rounds of matrix protein import but also prevents deleterious PEX5 retention in the membrane. Three peroxisome-associated ubiquitin-protein ligases in the Really Interesting New Gene (RING) family, PEX2, PEX10, and PEX12, facilitate PEX5 retrotranslocation. However, the detailed mechanism of receptor retrotranslocation remains unclear in plants. We identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>pex12</i> Glu-to-Lys missense allele that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>red severe peroxisomal defects, including impaired β-oxidation, inefficient matrix protein import, and decreased growth. We compared this <i>pex12-1</i> mutant to other peroxisome-associated ubiquitination-related mutants and found that RING peroxin mutants displayed elevated PEX5 and PEX7 levels, supporting the involvement of RING peroxins in receptor ubiquitination in Arabidopsis. Also, we observed that disruption of any Arabidopsis RING peroxin led to decreased PEX10 levels, as seen in yeast and mammals. Peroxisomal defects were exacerbated in RING peroxin double mutants, suggesting distinct roles of individual RING peroxins. Finally, reducing function of the peroxisome-associated ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme PEX4 restored PEX10 levels and partially ameliorated the other molecular and physiological defects of the <i>pex12-1</i> mutant. Future biochemical analyses will be needed to determine whether destabilization of the RING peroxin complex observed in <i>pex12-1</i> stems from PEX4-dependent ubiquitination on the pex12-1 ectopic Lys residue.</p>

The Evolution of Innate Immune Genes: Purifying and Balancing Selection on β-Defensins in Waterfowl
<p>In disease dynamics, high immune gene diversity can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong> a selective advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for genes involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector genes involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector genes; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five β-defensin genes were characterized in mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) and other waterfowl; key reservoir species for many zoonotic diseases. All five genes showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific β-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being fixed across all species investigated. Purifying selection to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these genes in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for balancing selection acting on the most recently duplicated β-defensin gene (<i>AvBD3b</i>). For this gene, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of β-defensin genes allows exploration of wider functional space. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian β-defensin effector molecules, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune genes, such as receptor and signalling molecules, where balancing selection to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.</p>

Lineage-Specific Transcriptional Profiles of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. Unaltered by Heat Stress in a Coral Host
<p>Dinoflagellates of the genus <i>Symbiodinium</i> form an endosymbiosis with reef building corals, in which photosynthetically derived nutrients comprise the majority of the coral energy budget. An extraordinary amount of functional and genetic diversity is contained within the coral-associated <i>Symbiodinium,</i> with some phylotypes (i.e., genotypic groupings), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>ring enhanced stress tolerance to host corals. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have enabled transcriptome-wide profiling of the stress response of the cnidarian coral host; however, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular response to stress of coral-associated <i>Symbiodinium,</i> as well as differences among physiologically susceptible and tolerant types, remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine the transcriptome-wide response to heat stress via RNA-Seq of two types of <i>Symbiodinium,</i> the putatively thermotolerant type D2 and the more susceptible type C3K, resident within the same coral host species, <i>Acropora hyacinthus</i>. Contrary to previous findings with coral hosts, we find no detectable change in gene expression across the dinoflagellate transcriptome after 3 days of elevated thermal exposure, despite physical evidence of symbiosis breakdown. However, hundreds of genes identified as orthologs between the C and D types exhibited significant expression differences within treatments (i.e., attributable solely to type, not heat exposure). These include many genes related to known thermotolerance mechanisms including heat shock proteins and chloroplast membrane components. Additionally, both the between-treatment similarities and between-type differences remained pervasive after 12–18 months of common garden acclimation and in mixed <i>Symbiodinium</i> assemblages within the same coral host colony.</p>

The Evolution of Genes within Genes and the Control of DNA Replication in Microviruses
<p>Single-stranded DNA(ssDNA) viral life cycles must balance double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ssDNA biosynthesis. Previously published in vitro results suggest that microvirus C and host cell SSB proteins play antagonistic roles to achieve this balance. To investigate this in vivo, microvirus DNA replication was characterized in cells expressing cloned C or <i>ssb</i> genes, which would presumably alter the C:SSB protein ratios. Representatives of each microvirus clade (φX174, G4, and α3) were used in these studies. α3 DNA replication was significantly more complex. Results suggested that the recognized α3 C gene (C<sub>S</sub>: small) is one of two C genes. A larger 5′ extended gene could be translated from an upstream GTG start codon (C<sub>B</sub>: big). Wild-type α3 acquired resistance to elevated SSB levels by mutations that exclusively frameshifted the C<sub>B</sub> reading frame, whereas mutations in the origin of replication <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>red resistance to elevated C protein levels. Expression of either the cloned C<sub>B</sub> or C<sub>S</sub> gene complemented <i>am(C)</i> mutants, demonstrating functional redundancy. When the C<sub>S</sub> start codon was eliminated, strains were only viable if an additional amber mutation was placed in gene C and propagated in an informational suppressing host. Thus, C<sub>B</sub> protein likely reaches toxic levels in the absence of C<sub>S</sub> translation. This phenomenon may have driven the evolution of the C<sub>S</sub> gene within the larger C<sub>B</sub> gene and could constitute a unique mechanism of regulation. Furthermore, cross-complementation data suggested that interactions between the α3 C and other viral proteins have evolved enough specificity to biochemically isolate its DNA replication from G4 and φX174.</p>

Physiological basis of starvation resistance in <i>Drosophila leontia</i>: analysis of sexual dimorphism
<p>Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in <i>Drosophila</i> species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen <i>Drosophila</i> species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11°45′–31°19′N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (~1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in <i>D. leontia</i>. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>red an increased longevity (~4–9 h; <i>P</i><0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=<i>K</i><sub>SR</sub>–C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in <i>D. leontia</i>.</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three cone photoreceptor classes for colour vision, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. Screening pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack screening pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>s an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four cone classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction.</p>

The stability of the hip after the use of a proximal femoral endoprosthesis for oncological indications
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Instability of the hip is the most common mode of failure after   reconstruction with a proximal femoral arthroplasty (PFA) using   an endoprosthesis after excision of a tumour. Small studies report   improved stability with capsular repair of the hip and other techniques,   but these have not been investigated in a large series of patients.   The aim of this study was to evaluate variables associated with   the patient and the operation that affect post-operative stability.   We hypothesised an association between capsular repair and stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective cohort study, we identified 527 adult patients   who were treated with a PFA for tumours. Our data included demographics,   the pathological diagnosis, the amount of resection of the abductor   muscles, the techniques of reconstruction and the characteristics   of the implant. We used regression analysis to compare patients   with and without post-operative instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 20 patients out of 527 (4%) had instability which   presented at a mean of 35 days (3 to 131) post-operatively. Capsular   repair was not associated with a reduced rate of instability. Bivariate   analysis showed that a posterolateral surgical approach (odds ratio   (OR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.86) and the type   of implant (p = 0.046) had a significant association with reduced   instability; age > 60 years predicted instability (OR 3.17, 95%   CI 1.00 to 9.98). Multivariate analysis showed age > 60 years (OR   5.09, 95% CI 1.23 to 21.07), female gender (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.04   to 2.89), a malignant primary bone tumour (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.06   to 3.95), and benign condition (OR 5.56, 95% CI 1.35 to 22.90),   but not metastatic disease or soft-tissue tumours, predicted instability,   while a posterolateral approach (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.53) was   protective against instability.

Each patient   was assigned an individualised baseline VTE risk score based on   a system using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Symptomatic VTE,   including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT),   were identified in the first 90 days post-operatively. Statistical   analyses were performed with logistic regression accounting for   baseline VTE risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The adjusted incidence of PE following SBTKA was 1.0% (95% confidence   interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.2) with aspirin and 2.2% (95% CI 2.0 to   2.4) with warfarin. Similarly, the adjusted incidence of VTE following   SBTKA was 1.6% (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) with aspirin and 2.5% (95% CI   1.9 to 3.3) with warfarin. The risk of PE and VTE were reduced by   66% (odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78) and 38% (OR 0.62,   95% CI 0.38 to 1.0), respectively, using aspirin. In addition, the risk   of PE was 204% higher for patients undergoing SBTKA relative to   those undergoing UTKA. For each ten-point increase in baseline VTE   risk, the risk of PE increased by 25.5% for patients undergoing   SBTKA compared with 10.5% for those undergoing UTKA.

<i>Arabidopsis</i> homeodomain-leucine zipper IV proteins promote stomatal development and ectopically induce stomata beyond the epidermis
<p>The shoot epidermis of land plants serves as a crucial interface between plants and the atmosphere: pavement cells protect plants from desiccation and other environmental stresses, while stomata facilitate gas exchange and transpiration. Advances have been made in our understanding of stomatal patterning and differentiation, and a set of ‘master regulatory’ transcription factors of stomatal development have been identified. However, they are limited to specifying stomatal differentiation within the epidermis. Here, we report the identification of an <i>Arabidopsis</i> homeodomain-leucine zipper IV (HD-ZIP IV) protein, HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS2 (HDG2), as a key epidermal component promoting stomatal differentiation. HDG2 is highly enriched in meristemoids, which are transient-amplifying populations of stomatal-cell lineages. Ectopic expression of <i>HDG2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>s differentiation of stomata in internal mesophyll tissues and occasional multiple epidermal layers. Conversely, a loss-of-function <i>hdg2</i> mutation delays stomatal differentiation and, rarely but consistently, results in aberrant stomata. A closely related <i>HD-ZIP IV</i> gene, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana MERISTEM LAYER1</i> (<i>AtML1</i>), shares overlapping function with <i>HDG2</i>: <i>AtML1</i> overexpression also triggers ectopic stomatal differentiation in the mesophyll layer and <i>atml1</i> mutation enhances the stomatal differentiation defects of <i>hdg2</i>. Consistently, HDG2 and AtML1 bind the same DNA elements, and activate transcription in yeast. Furthermore, HDG2 transactivates expression of genes that regulate stomatal development <i>in planta</i>. Our study highlights the similarities and uniqueness of these two <i>HD-ZIP IV</i> genes in the specification of protodermal identity and stomatal differentiation beyond predetermined tissue layers.</p>

We hypothesized that female sex is a stroke risk modifier, rather than an overall risk factor, when added to a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA (sex-independent thromboembolism risk) score scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using 3 nationwide registries, we identified patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2015. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant treatment at baseline were excluded, and person-time was censored at the time of treatment initiation (if any). CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were calculated for men and women, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was a primary hospital code for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (thromboembolism). We calculated crude event rates for risk strata as events per 100 person-years. For quantifying absolute risk of stroke, we calculated risks based on the pseudovalue method. Female sex as a prognostic factor was investigated by inclusion as an interaction term on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score to calculate the thromboembolic risk ratio for different score points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 239 671 patients with atrial fibrillation (48.7% women) contributed to the analyses. The mean ages for women and men were 76.6 years and 70.3 years, respectively; the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were 2.7 for women and 2.3 for men. The overall 1-year thromboembolic rate per 100 person-years for women was 7.3 and 5.7 for men. The 1-year absolute risk of thromboembolism was 0.5% among men and women with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score of 0 and increased up to >7% among very comorbid patients (score >5).

Extracellular Matrix Proteomics Reveals Interplay of Aggrecan and Aggrecanases in Vascular Remodeling of Stented Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling contributes to in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Despite its important clinical implications, little is known about ECM changes post–stent implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Bare-metal and drug-eluting stents were implanted in pig coronary arteries with an overstretch under optical coherence tomography guidance. Stented segments were harvested 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-stenting for proteomics analysis of the media and neointima.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 151 ECM and ECM-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. After stent implantation, proteins involved in regulating calcification were upregulated in the neointima of drug-eluting stents. The earliest changes in the media were proteins involved in inflammation and thrombosis, followed by changes in regulatory ECM proteins. By day 28, basement membrane proteins were reduced in drug-eluting stents in comparison with bare-metal stents. In contrast, the large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was increased. Aggrecanases of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family contribute to the catabolism of vascular proteoglycans. An increase in ADAMTS-specific aggrecan fragments was accompanied by a notable shift from <i>ADAMTS1</i> and <i>ADAMTS5</i> to <i>ADAMTS4</i> gene expression after stent implantation. Immunostaining in human stented coronary arteries confirmed the presence of aggrecan and aggrecan fragments, in particular, at the contacts of the stent struts with the artery. Further investigation of aggrecan presence in the human vasculature revealed that aggrecan and aggrecan cleavage were more abundant in human arteries than in human veins. In addition, aggrecan synthesis was induced on grafting a vein into the arterial circulation, suggesting an important role for aggrecan in vascular plasticity. Finally, lack of ADAMTS-5 activity in mice resulted in an accumulation of aggrecan and a dilation of the thoracic aorta, confirming that aggrecanase activity regulates aggrecan abundance in the arterial wall and contributes to vascular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant differences were identified by proteomics in the ECM of coronary arteries after bare-metal and drug-eluting stent implantation, most notably an upregulation of aggrecan, a major ECM component of cartilaginous tissues that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">confer</span></strong>s resistance to compression. The accumulation of aggrecan coincided with a shift in <i>ADAMTS</i> gene expression. This study provides the first evidence implicating aggrecan and aggrecanases in the vascular injury response after stenting.</p></sec>

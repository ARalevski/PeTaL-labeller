Disturbed Flow Promotes Arterial Stiffening Through Thrombospondin-1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Arterial stiffness and wall shear stress are powerful determinants of cardiovascular health, and arterial stiffness is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Low and oscillatory wall shear stress, termed disturbed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> (d-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>), promotes atherosclerotic arterial remodeling, but the relationship between d-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> and arterial stiffness is not well understood. The objective of this study was to define the role of d-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> on arterial stiffening and discover the relevant signaling pathways by which d-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> stiffens arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> was induced in the carotid arteries of young and old mice of both sexes. Arterial stiffness was quantified ex vivo with cylindrical biaxial mechanical testing and in vivo from duplex ultrasound and compared with unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Gene expression and pathway analysis was performed on endothelial cell–enriched RNA and validated by immunohistochemistry. In vitro testing of signaling pathways was performed under oscillatory and laminar wall shear stress conditions. Human arteries from regions of d-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> and stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> were tested ex vivo to validate critical results from the animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> induced arterial stiffening through collagen deposition after partial carotid ligation, and the degree of stiffening was similar to that of unmanipulated carotid arteries from 80-week-old mice. Intimal gene pathway analyses identified transforming growth factor-β pathways as having a prominent role in this stiffened arterial response, but this was attributable to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) stimulation of profibrotic genes and not changes to transforming growth factor-β. In vitro and in vivo testing under d-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> conditions identified a possible role for TSP-1 activation of transforming growth factor-β in the upregulation of these genes. TSP-1 knockout animals had significantly less arterial stiffening in response to d-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> than wild-type carotid arteries. Human arteries exposed to d-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> had similar increases TSP-1 and collagen gene expression as seen in our model.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TSP-1 has a critical role in shear-mediated arterial stiffening that is mediated in part through TSP-1’s activation of the profibrotic signaling pathways of transforming growth factor-β. Molecular targets in this pathway may lead to novel therapies to limit arterial stiffening and the progression of disease in arteries exposed to d-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>.</p></sec>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion from actin-mediated transport and measured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth. This model predicts that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sun<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>er (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sun<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>er leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> induced by muscarinic stimulation (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by application of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrations (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions and distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>–voltage relationship with a very small inward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> is not affected by either exclusion of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfusion with K<sup>+</sup>-free solution. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> by 95%, when applied into the pipette solution. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activation, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervation.</p>

Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> test kit.

A meta-analysis   of results was carried out: pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive   and negative likelihood ratio, heterogeneity and areas under curves   are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ten studies (759 patients) were included. Of these, seven studies   (640 patients) evaluated the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay   and three (119 patients) the lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> test. The pooled sensitivity   and specificity of the qualitative α-defensin laboratory immunoassay   was 0.953 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.984) and 0.965 (95%   CI 0.943 to 0.979) respectively.

Nitrite and <i>S</i>-Nitrosohemoglobin Exchange Across the Human Cerebral and Femoral Circulation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying red blood cell (RBC)–mediated hypoxic vasodilation remain controversial, with separate roles for nitrite ([Formula]) and <i>S</i>-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb) widely contested given their ability to transduce nitric oxide bioactivity within the microcirculation. To establish their relative contribution in vivo, we quantified arterial-venous concentration gradients across the human cerebral and femoral circulation at rest and during exercise, an ideal model system characterized by physiological extremes of O<sub>2</sub> tension and blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Ten healthy participants (5 men, 5 women) aged 24±4 (mean±SD) years old were randomly assigned to a normoxic (21% O<sub>2</sub>) and hypoxic (10% O<sub>2</sub>) trial with measurements performed at rest and after 30 minutes of cycling at 70% of maximal power output in hypoxia and equivalent relative and absolute intensities in normoxia. Blood was sampled simultaneously from the brachial artery and internal jugular and femoral veins with plasma and RBC nitric oxide metabolites measured by tri-iodide reductive chemiluminescence. Blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> was determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (cerebral blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>) and constant infusion thermodilution (femoral blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>) with net exchange calculated via the Fick principle.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Hypoxia was associated with a mild increase in both cerebral blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> and femoral blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> (<i>P</i><0.05 versus normoxia) with further, more pronounced increases observed in femoral blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> during exercise (<i>P</i><0.05 versus rest) in proportion to the reduction in RBC oxygenation (<i>r</i>=0.680–0.769, <i>P</i><0.001). Plasma [Formula] gradients reflecting consumption (arterial>venous; <i>P</i><0.05) were accompanied by RBC iron nitrosylhemoglobin formation (venous>arterial; <i>P</i><0.05) at rest in normoxia, during hypoxia (<i>P</i><0.05 versus normoxia), and especially during exercise (<i>P</i><0.05 versus rest), with the most pronounced gradients observed across the bioenergetically more active, hypoxemic, and acidotic femoral circulation (<i>P</i><0.05 versus cerebral).

Imaging of pure spin-valley diffusion current in WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures
<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials are promising for spintronic and valleytronic applications because valley-polarized excitations can be generated and manipulated with circularly polarized photons and the valley and spin degrees of freedom are locked by strong spin-orbital interactions. In this study we demonstrate efficient generation of a pure and locked spin-valley <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> in tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>)–tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) heterostructures without any driving electric field. We imaged the propagation of valley <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> in real time and space by pump-probe spectroscopy. The valley <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> in the heterostructures can live for more than 20 microseconds and propagate over 20 micrometers; both the lifetime and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion length can be controlled through electrostatic gating. The high-efficiency and electric-field–free generation of a locked spin-valley <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> in TMDC heterostructures holds promise for applications in spin and valley devices.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Myosins XI Are Involved in Exocytosis of Cellulose Synthase Complexes
<p>In plants, cellulose is synthesized at the cell surface by plasma membrane (PM)-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that underpin delivery of CSCs to the PM, however, are poorly understood. Cortical microtubules have been shown to interact with CESA-containing compartments and mark the site for CSC delivery, but are not required for the delivery itself. Here, we demonstrate that myosin XI and the actin cytoskeleton mediate CSC delivery to the PM by coordinating the exocytosis of CESA-containing compartments. Measurement of cellulose content indicated that cellulose biosynthesis was significantly reduced in a <i>myosin xik xi1 xi2</i> triple-knockout mutant. By combining genetic and pharmacological disruption of myosin activity with quantitative live-cell imaging, we observed decreased abundance of PM-localized CSCs and reduced delivery rate of CSCs in myosin-deficient cells. These phenotypes correlated with a significant increase in failed vesicle secretion events at the PM as well as an abnormal accumulation of CESA-containing compartments at the cell cortex. Through high-resolution spatiotemporal assays of cortical vesicle behavior, we identified defects in CSC vesicle tethering and fusion at the PM. Furthermore, disruption of myosin activity reduced the delivery of several other secretory markers to the PM and reduced constitutive and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These findings reveal a previously undescribed role for myosin in vesicle secretion and cellulose production at the cytoskeleton-PM-cell wall nexus.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the liquid-feeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>, velocity fields of the intake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies.</p>

Impact of Smoking on Circulating Cardiac Troponin I Concentrations and Cardiovascular Events in the General Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both tobacco smoking and circulating cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels are associated with the risk of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. However, whether cTnI levels differ according to smoking status and whether smoking modifies the prognostic relationship between cTnI and outcomes remain unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using data from a large, population-based cohort, we assessed the association between smoking and cTnI and the impact of smoking on the associations between cTnI levels and the incidence of acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. cTnI was measured with a high-sensitivity assay in 3824 never smokers, 2341 former smokers, and 2550 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> smokers participating in the prospective observational HUNT Study (Nord-Trøndelag Health Study).

This association remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders (B=−0.098; 95% confidence interval, −0.129 to −0.068). We observed an association between increasing concentrations of cTnI and clinical end points in the total study cohort (adjusted hazard ratio per log unit increase in cTnI, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–1.54). This association was attenuated for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> smokers (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.98–1.40) and was significantly weaker than in never/former smokers (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.003).

Hindered cytoplasmic diffusion of inositol trisphosphate restricts its cellular range of action
<p>The range of action of intracellular messengers is determined by their rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion and degradation. Previous measurements in oocyte cytoplasmic extracts indicated that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-liberating second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es with a coefficient (~280 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) similar to that in water, corresponding to a range of action of ~25 μm. Consequently, IP<sub>3</sub> is generally considered a “global” cellular messenger. We reexamined this issue by measuring local IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs to monitor IP<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ing from spot photorelease in neuroblastoma cells. Fitting these data by numerical simulations yielded a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient (≤10 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) about 30-fold slower than that previously reported. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of IP<sub>3</sub> in mammalian cells is hindered by binding to immobile, functionally inactive receptors that were diluted in oocyte extracts. The predicted range of action of IP<sub>3</sub> (<5 μm) is thus smaller than the size of typical mammalian cells, indicating that IP<sub>3</sub> should better be considered as a local rather than a global cellular messenger.</p>

Inhibition of somatosensory mechanotransduction by annexin A6
<p>Mechanically activated, slowly adapting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s in sensory neurons have been linked to noxious mechanosensation. The conotoxin NMB-1 (noxious mechanosensation blocker-1) blocks such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s and inhibits mechanical pain. Using a biotinylated form of NMB-1 in mass spectrometry analysis, we identified 67 binding proteins in sensory neurons and a sensory neuron–derived cell line, of which the top candidate was annexin A6, a membrane-associated calcium-binding protein. Annexin A6–deficient mice showed increased sensitivity to mechanical stimuli. Sensory neurons from these mice showed increased activity of the cation channel Piezo2, which mediates a rapidly adapting mechano-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> linked to proprioception and touch, and a decrease in mechanically activated, slowly adapting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s. Conversely, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory neurons inhibited rapidly adapting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s that were partially mediated by Piezo2. Furthermore, overexpression of annexin A6 in sensory neurons attenuated mechanical pain in a mouse model of osteoarthritis, a disease in which mechanically evoked pain is particularly problematic. These data suggest that annexin A6 can be exploited to inhibit chronic mechanical pain.</p>

SOCE mediated by STIM and Orai is essential for pacemaker activity in the interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract
<p>Electrical pacemaker activity generates phasic contractions and motility patterns such as segmentation and peristalsis in the gastrointestinal tract. Pacemaker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s are generated in interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which release Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores that stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>−</sup> channels (CaCCs) in the plasma membrane. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores must be maintained to sustain pacemaker activity. Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) facilitates the refilling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores by a mechanism dependent upon interactions between STIM and Orai proteins. We investigated the role of SOCE in ICC pacemaker activity. Reintroduction of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in store-depleted ICC resulted in CaCC activation. Blocking CaCCs revealed an inwardly rectifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> with properties of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> release–activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub>). An inhibitory peptide that interfered with the STIM-Orai interaction blocked <i>I</i><sub>CRAC</sub> in HEK 293 cells expressing STIM1 and Orai1 and blocked spontaneous transient inward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s (STICs) and slow wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s in ICC. STICs, which are fundamental pacemaker events in ICC, were blocked by an Orai antagonist. Imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients linked to pacemaker activity in ICC in intact muscles showed that the Orai antagonist blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in ICC. These data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> recovery through STIM-Orai interactions is necessary to maintain ICC pacemaker activity.</p>

Imaging rotational dynamics of nanoparticles in liquid by 4D electron microscopy
<p>In real time and space, four-dimensional electron microscopy (4D EM) has enabled observation of transient structures and morphologies of inorganic and organic materials. We have extended 4D EM to include liquid cells without the time resolution being limited by the response of the detector. Our approach permits the imaging of the motion and morphological dynamics of a single, same particle on nanometer and ultrashort time scales. As a first application, we studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional dynamics of gold nanoparticles in aqueous solution. A full transition from the conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion to super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and further to a ballistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion was observed with increasing asymmetry of the nanoparticle morphology. We explored the underlying physics both experimentally and theoretically according to the morphological asymmetry of the nanoparticles.</p>

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a programmed walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion pattern (optic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of optic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as optic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant optic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the programmed walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of programmed behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of optic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

Variation in functional pelvic tilt in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The pelvis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>es in the sagittal plane during daily activities.   These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ions have a direct effect on the functional orientation   of the acetabulum. The aim of this study was to quantify changes   in pelvic tilt between different functional positions.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Pre-operatively, pelvic tilt was measured in 1517 patients undergoing   total hip arthroplasty (THA) in three functional positions – supine,   standing and flexed seated (the moment when patients initiate rising   from a seated position). Supine pelvic tilt was measured from CT   scans, standing and flexed seated pelvic tilts were measured from standardised   lateral radiographs. Anterior pelvic tilt was assigned a positive   value.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean pelvic tilt was 4.2° (-20.5° to 24.5°), -1.3° (-30.2°   to 27.9°) and 0.6° (-42.0° to 41.3°) in the three positions, respectively.   The mean sagittal pelvic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion from supine to standing was -5.5°   (-21.8° to 8.4°), from supine to flexed seated was -3.7° (-48.3°   to 38.6°) and from standing to flexed seated was 1.8° (-51.8° to   39.5°). In 259 patients (17%), the extent of sagittal pelvic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion   could lead to functional malorientation of the acetabular component.

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau. This method evaluates the femur medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion. When sitting cross-legged, femurs displayed internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion   from 10° to 100°. From 100°, femoral external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion was observed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was observed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The measure kinematic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial pivoting pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°. During   kneeling, a medial pivot pattern was evident. When sitting cross-legged,   a lateral pivot pattern was seen from 0° to 100°, and a medial pivot   pattern beyond 100°.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The kinematics of normal knees during high flexion are variable   according to activity. Nevertheless, our study was limited to a   small number of male patients using a different technique to report   the kinematics than previous publications.

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral injury is an important complication after cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) target for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. Pump <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6. Secondary outcomes included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging–evaluated total number of new ischemic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 197 enrolled patients, mean (SD) age was 65.0 (10.7) years in the low-target group (n=99) and 69.4 (8.9) years in the high-target group (n=98). Procedural risk scores were comparable between groups. Overall, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging revealed new cerebral lesions in 52.8% of patients in the low-target group versus 55.7% in the high-target group (<i>P</i>=0.76). The primary outcome of volume of new cerebral lesions was comparable between groups, 25 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–118 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–25 261 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the low-target group versus 29 mm<sup>3</sup> (interquartile range, 0–143 mm<sup>3</sup>; range, 0–22 116 mm<sup>3</sup>) in the high-target group (median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, −25 to 0.028; <i>P</i>=0.99), as was the secondary outcome of number of new lesions (1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–24] versus 1 [interquartile range, 0–2; range, 0–29] respectively; median difference estimate, 0; 95% confidence interval, 0–0; <i>P</i>=0.71).

Delayed Repolarization Underlies Ventricular Arrhythmias in Rats With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents approximately half of heart failure, and its incidence continues to increase. The leading cause of mortality in HFpEF is sudden death, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) from 7 weeks of age to induce HFpEF (n=38). Rats fed a normal-salt diet (0.3% NaCl) served as controls (n=13). Echocardiograms were performed to assess systolic and diastolic function from 14 weeks of age. HFpEF-verified and control rats underwent programmed electrical stimulation. Corrected QT interval was measured by surface ECG. The mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) were probed by optical mapping, whole-cell patch clamp to measure action potential duration and ionic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to investigate changes in ion channel expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After 7 weeks of a high-salt diet, 31 of 38 rats showed diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction along with signs of heart failure and hence were diagnosed with HFpEF. Programmed electric stimulation demonstrated increased susceptibility to VA in HFpEF rats (<i>P</i><0.001 versus controls). The arrhythmogenicity index was increased (<i>P</i><0.001) and the corrected QT interval on ECG was prolonged (<i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF rats. Optical mapping of HFpEF hearts demonstrated prolonged action potentials (<i>P</i><0.05) and multiple reentry circuits during induced VA. Single-cell recordings of cardiomyocytes isolated from HFpEF rats confirmed a delay of repolarization (<i>P</i>=0.001) and revealed downregulation of transient outward potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>; <i>P</i><0.05). The rapid components of the delayed rectifier potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>Kr</sub>) and the inward rectifier potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>K1</sub>) were also downregulated (<i>P</i><0.05), but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> densities were much lower than for <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>. In accordance with the reduction of <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>, both <i>Kcnd3</i> transcript and Kv4.3 protein levels were decreased in HFpEF rat hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Susceptibility to VA was markedly increased in rats with HFpEF. Underlying abnormalities include QT prolongation, delayed repolarization from downregulation of potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>s, and multiple reentry circuits during VA. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> downregulation leads to abnormal repolarization in HFpEF, which in turn predisposes to VA and sudden cardiac death.</p></sec>

Preterm Delivery and Maternal Cardiovascular Disease in Young and Middle-Aged Adult Women

When preterm delivery was split into moderate preterm (≥32 to <37 weeks) and very preterm (<32 weeks), the HRs were 1.22 (95% CI, 0.96–1.54) and 2.01 (95% CI, 1.47–2.75), respectively. The increased rate of CVD in the very preterm group persisted even among women whose first pregnancy was not complicated by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.38–2.93). In comparison with women with at least 2 pregnancies, all of which were delivered at term, women with a preterm first birth and at least 1 later preterm birth had a HR of CVD of 1.65 (95% CI, 1.20–2.28). The association between moderate preterm first birth and CVD was accounted for in part by the development of postpartum chronic hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and changes in body mass index (proportion accounted for, 14.5%; 95% CI, 4.0–41.1), as was the very-preterm-CVD relationship (13.1%; 95% CI, 9.0–18.7).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Preterm delivery is independently predictive of CVD and may be useful for CVD prevention efforts.

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to summer soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> to declining soil moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> to declining soil moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

Asteroseismic detection of latitudinal differential rotation in 13 Sun-like stars

Twistable electronics with dynamically rotatable heterostructures
<p>In heterostructures of two-dimensional materials, electronic properties can vary dramatically with relative interlayer angle. This effect makes it theoretically possible to realize a new class of twistable electronics in which properties can be manipulated on demand by means of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion. We demonstrate a device architecture in which a layered heterostructure can be dynamically twisted in situ. We study graphene encapsulated by boron nitride, where, at small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion angles, the device characteristics are dominated by coupling to a long-wavelength moirééé superlattice. The ability to investigate arbitrary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion angle in a single device reveals features of the optical, mechanical, and electronic response in this system not captured in static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion studies. Our results establish the capability to fabricate twistable electronic devices with dynamically tunable properties.</p>

Self-heating–induced healing of lithium dendrites
<p>Lithium (Li) metal electrodes are not deployable in rechargeable batteries because electrochemical plating and stripping invariably leads to growth of dendrites that reduce coulombic efficiency and eventually short the battery. It is generally accepted that the dendrite problem is exacerbated at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> densities. Here, we report a regime for dendrite evolution in which the reverse is true. In our experiments, we found that when the plating and stripping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> density is raised above ~9 milliamperes per square centimeter, there is substantial self-heating of the dendrites, which triggers extensive surface migration of Li. This surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion heals the dendrites and smoothens the Li metal surface. We show that repeated doses of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>-density healing treatment enables the safe cycling of Li-sulfur batteries with high coulombic efficiency.</p>

Complete measurement of helicity and its dynamics in vortex tubes
<p>Helicity, a topological measure of the intertwining of vortices in a fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>, is a conserved quantity in inviscid fluids but can be dissipated by viscosity in real <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>s. Despite its relevance across a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>s, helicity in real fluids remains poorly understood because the entire quantity is challenging to measure. We measured the total helicity of thin-core vortex tubes in water. For helical vortices that are stretched or compressed by a second vortex, we found conservation of total helicity. For an isolated helical vortex, we observed evolution toward and maintenance of a constant helicity state after the dissipation of twist helicity by viscosity. Our results show that helicity can remain constant even in a viscous fluid and provide an improved basis for understanding and manipulating helicity in real <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>s.</p>

When early adopters don't adopt
<p>Individuals who naturally adopt a new technology early are important for influencing whether and how the technology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es more broadly among later users (<i>1</i>–<i>7</i>). Such natural early adopters (NEAs) may influence the difference between successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of new technology and failure. Yet the factors that most influence how and why NEAs engage with new technologies are not entirely understood. We asked, “What if natural early adopters are not able to adopt early?” This paper is the first to measure the counterfactual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion curve that occurs when NEAs are not allowed to adopt early. The results suggest that NEAs can stifle broader <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of a technology if their usual ability to be first—and to derive value from being first—is compromised. Small changes in the initial availability of a technology among different types of users can have a lasting effect on its potential.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Multiplexed Gene Editing and Protein Overexpression Using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> Viral Vector
<p>Development of CRISPR/Cas9 transient gene editing screening tools in plant biology has been hindered by difficulty of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deliveri</span></strong>ng high quantities of biologically active single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Furthermore, it has been largely accepted that in vivo generated sgRNAs need to be devoid of extraneous nucleotides, which has limited sgRNA expression by delivery vectors. Here, we increased cellular concentrations of sgRNA by transiently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deliveri</span></strong>ng sgRNAs using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-derived vector (TRBO) designed with 5′ and 3′ sgRNA proximal nucleotide-processing capabilities. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we used the TRBO-sgRNA delivery platform to target GFP in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (16c) plants, and gene editing was accompanied by loss of GFP expression. Surprisingly, indel (insertions and deletions) percentages averaged nearly 70% within 7 d postinoculation using the TRBO-sgRNA constructs, which retained 5′ nucleotide overhangs. In contrast, and in accordance with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong> models, in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays only edited DNA when 5′ sgRNA nucleotide overhangs were removed, suggesting a novel processing mechanism is occurring in planta. Since the Cas9/TRBO-sgRNA platform demonstrated sgRNA flexibility, we targeted the <i>N. benthamiana NbAGO1</i> paralogs with one sgRNA and also multiplexed two sgRNAs using a single TRBO construct, resulting in indels in three genes. TRBO-mediated expression of an RNA transcript consisting of an sgRNA adjoining a GFP protein coding region produced indels and viral-based GFP overexpression. In conclusion, multiplexed delivery of sgRNAs using the TRBO system offers flexibility for gene expression and editing and uncovered novel aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 biology.</p>

The role of the olfactory recess in olfactory airflow
<p>The olfactory recess – a blind pocket at the back of the nasal airway – is thought to play an important role in mammalian olfaction by sequestering air outside of the main airstream, thus giving odorants time to re-circulate. Several studies have shown that species with large olfactory recesses tend to have a well-developed sense of smell. However, no study has investigated how the size of the olfactory recess relates to air circulation near the olfactory epithelium. Here we used a computer model of the nasal cavity from a bat (<i>Carollia perspicillata</i>) to test the hypothesis that a larger olfactory recess improves olfactory air<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>. We predicted that during inhalation, models with an enlarged olfactory recess would have slower rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> through the olfactory region (i.e. the olfactory recess plus airspace around the olfactory epithelium), while during exhalation these models would have little to no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> through the olfactory recess. To test these predictions, we experimentally modified the size of the olfactory recess while holding the rest of the morphology constant. During inhalation, we found that an enlarged olfactory recess resulted in lower rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> in the olfactory region. Upon exhalation, air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong>ed through the olfactory recess at a lower rate in the model with an enlarged olfactory recess. Taken together, these results indicate that an enlarged olfactory recess improves olfactory air<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> during both inhalation and exhalation. These findings add to our growing understanding of how the morphology of the nasal cavity may relate to function in this understudied region of the skull.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> conditions.</p>

Arthroscopic decompression not recommended in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tendinopathy has a multifactorial origin. Rejecting   the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning operative treatment   at initial presentation in the first line.

The patients   were randomised into two treatment groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty   and a supervised exercise treatment and a similar supervised exercise   treatment alone. Self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS)   was the primary outcome measure.

Chronic Rejection of Cardiac Allografts Is Associated With Increased Lymphatic Flow and Cellular Trafficking
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an excellent treatment for end-stage heart disease. However, rejection of the donor graft, in particular, by chronic rejection leading to cardiac allograft vasculopathy, remains a major cause of graft loss. The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in the alloimmune response, facilitating trafficking of antigen-presenting cells to draining lymph nodes. The encounter of antigen-presenting cells with T lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs is essential for the initiation of alloimmunity. Donor lymphatic vessels are not anastomosed to that of the recipient during transplantation. The pathophysiology of lymphatic disruption is unknown, and whether this disruption enhances or hinders the alloimmune responses is unclear. Although histological analysis of lymphatic vessels in donor grafts can yield information on the structure of the lymphatics, the function following cardiac transplantation is poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography lymphoscintigraphy, we quantified the lymphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> index following heterotrophic cardiac transplantation in a murine model of chronic rejection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Ten weeks following transplantation of a minor antigen (HY) sex-mismatched heart graft, the lymphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> index was significantly increased in comparison with sex-matched controls. Furthermore, the enhanced lymphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> index correlated with an increase in donor cells in the mediastinal draining lymph nodes; increased lymphatic vessel area; and graft infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Chronic rejection results in increased lymphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> from the donor graft to draining lymph nodes, which may be a factor in promoting cellular trafficking, alloimmunity, and cardiac allograft vasculopathy.</p></sec>

Clinical Outcomes and Cost-Effectiveness of Fractional Flow Reserve–Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies found that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not improve outcome compared with medical therapy (MT) in patients with stable coronary artery disease, but PCI was guided by angiography alone. FAME 2 trial (Fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) compared PCI guided by fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> reserve with best MT in patients with stable coronary artery disease to assess clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 888 patients with stable single-vessel or multivessel coronary artery disease with reduced fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> reserve were randomly assigned to PCI plus MT (n=447) or MT alone (n=441). Major adverse cardiac events included death, myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization. Costs were calculated on the basis of resource use and Medicare reimbursement rates. Changes in quality-adjusted life-years were assessed with utilities determined by the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions health survey at baseline and over follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Major adverse cardiac events at 3 years were significantly lower in the PCI group compared with the MT group (10.1% versus 22.0%; <i>P</i><0.001), primarily as a result of a lower rate of urgent revascularization (4.3% versus 17.2%; <i>P</i><0.001). Death and myocardial infarction were numerically lower in the PCI group (8.3% versus 10.4%; <i>P</i>=0.28). Angina was significantly less severe in the PCI group at all follow-up points to 3 years. Mean initial costs were higher in the PCI group ($9944 versus $4440; <i>P</i><0.001) but by 3 years were similar between the 2 groups ($16 792 versus $16 737; <i>P</i>=0.94). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PCI compared with MT was $17 300 per quality-adjusted life-year at 2 years and $1600 per quality-adjusted life-year at 3 years. The above findings were robust in sensitivity analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>ConclusionS:</title><p>PCI of lesions with reduced fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> reserve improves long-term outcome and is economically attractive compared with MT alone in patients with stable coronary artery disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Augmentation of Muscle Blood Flow by Ultrasound Cavitation Is Mediated by ATP and Purinergic Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Augmentation of tissue blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> by therapeutic ultrasound is thought to rely on convective shear. Microbubble contrast agents that undergo ultrasound-mediated cavitation markedly amplify these effects. We hypothesized that purinergic signaling is responsible for shear-dependent increases in muscle perfusion during therapeutic cavitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unilateral exposure of the proximal hindlimb of mice (with or without ischemia produced by iliac ligation) to therapeutic ultrasound (1.3 MHz, mechanical index 1.3) was performed for 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 2×10<sup>8</sup> lipid microbubbles. Microvascular perfusion was evaluated by low-power contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging. In vivo muscle ATP release and in vitro ATP release from endothelial cells or erythrocytes were assessed by a luciferin-luciferase assay. Purinergic signaling pathways were assessed by studying interventions that (1) accelerated ATP degradation; (2) inhibited P2Y receptors, adenosine receptors, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels; or (3) inhibited downstream signaling pathways involving endothelial nitric oxide synthase or prostanoid production (indomethacin). Augmentation in muscle perfusion by ultrasound cavitation was assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 12 subjects with stable sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound cavitation increased muscle perfusion by 7-fold in normal mice, reversed tissue ischemia for up to 24 hours in the murine model of peripheral artery disease, and doubled muscle perfusion in patients with sickle cell disease. Augmentation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> extended well beyond the region of ultrasound exposure. Ultrasound cavitation produced an ≈40-fold focal and sustained increase in ATP, the source of which included both endothelial cells and erythrocytes. Inhibitory studies indicated that ATP was a critical mediator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> augmentation that acts primarily through either P2Y receptors or adenosine produced by ectonucleotidase activity. Combined indomethacin and inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase abolished the effects of therapeutic ultrasound, indicating downstream signaling through both nitric oxide and prostaglandins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound using microbubble cavitation to increase muscle perfusion relies on shear-dependent increases in ATP, which can act through a diverse portfolio of purinergic signaling pathways. These events can reverse hindlimb ischemia in mice for >24 hours and increase muscle blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> in patients with sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Membrane Proteomic Insights into the Physiology and Taxonomy of an Oleaginous Green Microalga
<p><i>Ettlia</i> <i>oleoabundans</i> is a nonsequenced oleaginous green microalga. Despite the significant biotechnological interest in producing value-added compounds from the acyl lipids of this microalga, a basic understanding of the physiology and biochemistry of oleaginous microalgae is lacking, especially under nitrogen deprivation conditions known to trigger lipid accumulation. Using an RNA sequencing-based proteomics approach together with manual annotation, we are able to provide, to our knowledge, the first membrane proteome of an oleaginous microalga. This approach allowed the identification of novel proteins in <i>E. oleoabundans</i>, including two photoprotection-related proteins, Photosystem II Subunit S and Maintenance of Photosystem II under High Light1, which were considered exclusive to higher photosynthetic organisms, as well as Retinitis Pigmentosa Type 2-Clathrin Light Chain, a membrane protein with a novel domain architecture. Free-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> zonal electrophoresis of microalgal membranes coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proved to be a useful technique for determining the intracellular location of proteins of interest. Carbon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> compartmentalization in <i>E. oleoabundans</i> was modeled using this information. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of protein markers and 18S ribosomal DNA support the reclassification of <i>E. oleoabundans</i> within the trebouxiophycean microalgae, rather than with the Chlorophyceae class, in which it is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">current</span></strong>ly classified, indicating that it may not be closely related to the model green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. A detailed survey of biological processes taking place in the membranes of nitrogen-deprived <i>E. oleoabundans</i>, including lipid metabolism, provides insights into the basic biology of this nonmodel organism.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and polar bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the polar bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and polar bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and polar bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and polar bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flow</span></strong> is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

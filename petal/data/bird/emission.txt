Impact of Bystander Automated External Defibrillator Use on Survival and Functional Outcomes in Shockable Observed Public Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable rhythms can be improved with early defibrillation. Although shockable OHCA accounts for only ≈25% of overall arrests, ≈60% of public OHCAs are shockable, offering the possibility of restoring thousands of individuals to full recovery with early defibrillation by bystanders. We sought to determine the association of bystander automated external defibrillator use with survival and functional outcomes in shockable observed public OHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium prospectively collected detailed information on all cardiac arrests at 9 regional centers. The exposures were shock administration by a bystander-applied automated external defibrillator in comparison with initial defibrillation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emerg</span></strong>ency medical services. The primary outcome measure was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with normal or near-normal (favorable) functional status defined as a modified Rankin Score ≤2. Survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e was the secondary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 49 555 OHCAs, 4115 (8.3%) observed public OHCAs were analyzed, of which 2500 (60.8%) were shockable. A bystander shock was applied in 18.8% of the shockable arrests. Patients shocked by a bystander were significantly more likely to survive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e (66.5% versus 43.0%) and be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed with favorable functional outcome (57.1% versus 32.7%) than patients initially shocked by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emerg</span></strong>ency medical services. After adjusting for known predictors of outcome, the odds ratio associated with a bystander shock was 2.62 (95% confidence interval, 2.07–3.31) for survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e and 2.73 (95% confidence interval, 2.17–3.44) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with favorable functional outcome. The benefit of bystander shock increased progressively as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emerg</span></strong>ency medical services response time became longer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Bystander automated external defibrillator use before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emerg</span></strong>ency medical services arrival in shockable observed public OHCA was associated with better survival and functional outcomes. Continued emphasis on public automated external defibrillator utilization programs may further improve outcomes of OHCA.</p></sec>

Ligand- and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels differentially regulate the mode of vesicular neuropeptide release in mammalian sensory neurons
<p>Neuropeptides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons play essential roles in the neurotransmission of sensory inputs, including those underlying nociception and pathological pain. Neuropeptides are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed from intracellular vesicles through two modes: a partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e mode called “kiss-and-run” (KAR) and a full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e mode called “full fusion–like” (FFL). Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we traced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein–tagged neuropeptide Y (pHluorin-NPY) from individual dense-core vesicles in the soma and axon of single DRG neurons after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through either voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) or ligand-gated transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through VGCCs stimulated FFL and a greater single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of neuropeptides. In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV1 channels stimulated KAR and a pulsed but prolonged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of neuropeptides that was partially mediated by Dynamin 1, which limits fusion pore expansion. Suppressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient to an extent similar to that seen after TRPV1 activation abolished the VGCC preference for FFL. The findings suggest that by generating a steeper Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient, VGCCs promote a more robust fusion pore opening that facilitates FFL. Thus, KAR and FFL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e modes are differentially regulated by the two principal types of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels in DRG neurons.</p>

Photoperiod and temperature responses of bud swelling and bud burst in four temperate forest tree species
<p>Spring phenology of temperate forest trees is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to temperature and photoperiod. We investigated the response of early spring phenology to temperature and photoperiod at different stages of dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e in cuttings from four temperate tree species in controlled environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud swelling and bud growth in <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L., <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Mattuschka) Liebl. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e, the onset and duration of the bud swelling prior to bud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong> are driven by concurrent temperature and photoperiod, while the maximum growth rate is temperature dependent only, except for <i>Fagus</i>, where long photoperiods also increased bud growth rates. Similarly, the later bud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong> was controlled by temperature and photoperiod (in the photoperiod sensitive species <i>Fagus, Quercus</i> and <i>Picea</i>). We conclude that photoperiod is involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong> in trees that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud swelling period that precedes and defines later phenological stages such as canopy greening in conventional phenological works. It is the early bud growth resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of tree phenology at a large scale. Classic spring phenology events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here.</p>

Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling draws heat from surfaces and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>es it into space as infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ance and the low infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ive cooling as a viable energy technology.</p>

Discharge on the day of surgery following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty within the United Kingdom NHS
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been successfully   performed in the United States healthcare system on outpatients.   Despite differences in healthcare structure and financial environment,   we hypothesised that it would be feasible to replicate this success   and perform UKA with safe day of surgery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e within the NHS,   in the United Kingdom.

Cholesterol Efflux Capacity, High-Density Lipoprotein Particle Number, and Incident Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent failures of drugs that raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular events in clinical trials have led to increased interest in alternative indices of HDL quality, such as cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">efflux</span></strong> capacity, and HDL quantity, such as HDL particle number. However, no studies have directly compared these metrics in a contemporary population that includes potent statin therapy and low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HDL cholesterol levels, apolipoprotein A-I, cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">efflux</span></strong> capacity, and HDL particle number were assessed at baseline and 12 months in a nested case-control study of the JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), a randomized primary prevention trial that compared rosuvastatin treatment to placebo in individuals with normal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but increased C-reactive protein levels. In total, 314 cases of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, or cardiovascular death) were compared to age- and gender-matched controls. Conditional logistic regression models adjusting for risk factors evaluated associations between HDL-related biomarkers and incident CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">efflux</span></strong> capacity was moderately correlated with HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, and HDL particle number (Spearman <i>r</i>= 0.39, 0.48, and 0.39 respectively; <i>P</i><0.001). Baseline HDL particle number was inversely associated with incident CVD (adjusted odds ratio per SD increment [OR/SD], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56–0.86; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas no significant association was found for baseline cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">efflux</span></strong> capacity (OR/SD, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72–1.10; <i>P</i>=0.28), HDL cholesterol (OR/SD, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.08), or apolipoprotein A-I (OR/SD, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67–1.03; <i>P</i>=0.08).

Chemical synapses without synaptic vesicles: Purinergic neurotransmission through a CALHM1 channel-mitochondrial signaling complex
<p>Conventional chemical synapses in the nervous system involve a presynaptic accumulation of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e neurotransmitters that activate postsynaptic receptors. In taste buds, type II receptor cells do not have conventional synaptic features but nonetheless show regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of their afferent neurotransmitter, ATP, through a large-pore, voltage-gated channel, CALHM1. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CALHM1 was localized to points of contact between the receptor cells and sensory nerve fibers. Ultrastructural and super-resolution light microscopy showed that the CALHM1 channels were consistently associated with distinctive, large (1- to 2-μm) mitochondria spaced 20 to 40 nm from the presynaptic membrane. Pharmacological disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain limited the ability of taste cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e ATP, suggesting that the immediate source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed ATP was the mitochondrion rather than a cytoplasmic pool of ATP. These large mitochondria may serve as both a reservoir of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>able ATP and the site of synthesis. The juxtaposition of the large mitochondria to areas of membrane displaying CALHM1 also defines a restricted compartment that limits the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon opening of the nonselective CALHM1 channels. These findings reveal a distinctive organelle signature and functional organization for regulated, focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of purinergic signals in the absence of synaptic vesicles.</p>

Extension of chemotactic pseudopods by nonadherent human neutrophils does not require or cause calcium bursts
<p>Global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong>s in free intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are among the most conspicuous signaling events in immune cells. To test the common view that Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong>s mediate rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in response to the activation of G protein–coupled receptors, we combined single-cell manipulation with fluorescence imaging and monitored the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in individual human neutrophils during complement-mediated chemotaxis. By decoupling purely chemotactic pseudopod formation from cell-substrate adhesion, we showed that physiological concentrations of anaphylatoxins, such as C5a, induced nonadherent human neutrophils to form chemotactic pseudopods but did not elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong>s. By contrast, pathological or supraphysiological concentrations of C5a often triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong>s, but pseudopod protrusion stalled or reversed in such cases, effectively halting chemotaxis, similar to sepsis-associated neutrophil paralysis. The maximum increase in cell surface area during pseudopod extension in pure chemotaxis was much smaller—by a factor of 8—than the known capacity of adherent human neutrophils to expand their surface. Because the measured rise in cortical tension was not sufficient to account for this difference, we attribute the limited deformability to a reduced ability of the cytoskeleton to generate protrusive force in the absence of cell adhesion. Thus, we hypothesize that Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong>s in neutrophils control a mechanistic switch between two distinct modes of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics. A key element of this switch appears to be the expedient coordination of adhesion-dependent lock or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e events of cytoskeletal membrane anchors.</p>

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed corticotropin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased activity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission increased neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, reduced GABAergic transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased activity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF exposure. Activating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA activity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated disorders.</p>

The DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome controls radiation-induced cell death and tissue injury
<p>Acute exposure to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ionizing radi</span></strong>ation induces massive cell death and severe damage to tissues containing actively proliferating cells, including bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology remain controversial. Here, we show that mice deficient in the double-stranded DNA sensor AIM2 are protected from both subtotal body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation–induced gastrointestinal syndrome and total body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation–induced hematopoietic failure. AIM2 mediates the caspase-1–dependent death of intestinal epithelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to double-strand DNA breaks caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ionizing radi</span></strong>ation and chemotherapeutic agents. Mechanistically, we found that AIM2 senses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion-induced DNA damage in the nucleus to mediate inflammasome activation and cell death. Our results suggest that AIM2 may be a new therapeutic target for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ionizing radi</span></strong>ation exposure.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e two or more neurotransmitters including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed with small-molecule neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior.

An in Vivo Imaging Assay Detects Spatial Variability in Glucose Release from Plant Roots
<p>Plants secrete a plethora of metabolites into the rhizosphere that allow them to obtain nutrients necessary for growth and modify microbial communities around the roots. Plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e considerable amounts of photosynthetically fixed carbon into the rhizosphere; hence, it is important to understand how carbon moves from the roots into the rhizosphere. Approaches used previously to address this question involved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radioact</span></strong>ive tracers, fluorescent probes, and biosensors to study sugar movement in the roots and into the rhizosphere. Although quite effective for studying sugar movement, it has been challenging to obtain data on spatial and temporal variability in sugar exudation using these techniques. In this study, we developed a gel-based enzyme-coupled colorimetric and fluorometric assay to image glucose (Glc) in vivo and used this assay to show that there is spatial variability in Glc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from plant roots. We found that the primary roots of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed more Glc from the base of the root than from the root tip and that the Glc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e rate is reduced in response to water stress. These findings were confirmed independently by quantifying Glc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e in well-watered and water-stressed maize primary roots using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. Additionally, we demonstrated differential patterns of Glc exudation in different monocot and eudicot plant species. These findings and their implications on root-rhizosphere interactions are discussed.</p>

Lipopolysaccharides Trigger Two Successive Bursts of Reactive Oxygen Species at Distinct Cellular Locations
<p>Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are major components of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and are an important microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) that triggers immune responses in plants and animals. A previous genetic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) identified LIPOOLIGOSACCHARIDE-SPECIFIC REDUCED ELICITATION (LORE), a B-type lectin <i>S</i>-domain receptor kinase, as a sensor of LPS. However, the LPS-activated LORE signaling pathway and associated immune responses remain largely unknown. In this study, we found that LPS trigger biphasic production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Arabidopsis. The first transient ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong> was similar to that induced by another MAMP, flagellin, whereas the second long-lasting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong> was induced only by LPS. The LPS-triggered second ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong> was found to be conserved in a variety of plant species. Microscopic observation of the generation of ROS revealed that the LPS-triggered second ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong> was largely associated with chloroplasts, and functional chloroplasts were indispensable for this response. The lipid A moiety, the most conserved portion of LPS, appears to be responsible for the second ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong>. Surprisingly, the LPS- and lipid A-triggered second ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong> was only partially dependent on LORE. Together, our findings provide insight on the LPS-triggered ROS production and the associated signaling pathway.</p>

Transcriptome and Degradome Sequencing Reveals Dormancy Mechanisms of <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> Seeds<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Seeds with physiological dormancy usually experience primary and secondary dormancy in the nature; however, little is known about the differential regulation of primary and secondary dormancy. We combined multiple approaches to investigate cytological changes, hormonal levels, and gene expression dynamics in <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> seeds during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e and secondary dormancy induction. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that protein bodies in the embryo cells coalesced during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e and then separated during secondary dormancy induction. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that expression of genes negatively regulating gibberellic acid (GA) sensitivity reduced specifically during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e, whereas the expression of genes positively regulating abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis increased during secondary dormancy induction. Parallel analysis of RNA ends revealed uncapped transcripts for ∼55% of all unigenes. A negative correlation between fold changes in expression levels of uncapped versus capped mRNAs was observed during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e. However, this correlation was loose during secondary dormancy induction. Our analyses suggest that the reversible changes in cytology and gene expression during dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e and induction are related to ABA/GA balance. Moreover, mRNA degradation functions as a critical posttranscriptional regulator during primary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding physiological dormancy in seeds.</p>

Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Older Women After Contemporary Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes are resistant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. However, cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation, a perturbation implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) and particularly HF with preserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction (HFpEF). Radiotherapy for breast cancer results in variable cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure and may increase the risk of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a population-based case-control study of incident HF in 170 female residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (59 cases and 111 controls), who underwent contemporary (1998–2013) radiotherapy for breast cancer with computed tomography–assisted radiotherapy planning. Controls were matched to cases for age, tumor side, chemotherapy use, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Mean cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion dose (MCRD) in each patient was calculated from the patient’s computed tomography images and radiotherapy plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean age at radiotherapy was 69±9 years. Of HF cases, 38 (64%) had EF≥50% (HFpEF), 18 (31%) had EF<50% (HF with reduced EF), and 3 (5%) did not have EF measured. The EF was ≥40% in 50 of the 56 HF cases (89%) with an EF measurement. The mean interval from radiotherapy to HF was 5.8±3.4 years. The odds of HF was higher in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or atrial fibrillation. The MCRD was 2.5 Gy (range, 0.2–13.1 Gy) and higher in cases (3.3±2.7 Gy) than controls (2.1±2.0 Gy; <i>P</i>=0.004). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HF per log MCRD was 9.1 (3.4–24.4) for any HF, 16.9 (3.9–73.7) for HFpEF, and 3.17 (0.8–13.0) for HF with reduced EF. The increased odds of any HF or HFpEF with increasing MCRD remained significant after adjustment for HF risk factors and in sensitivity analyses matching by cancer stage rather than tumor side. Only 18.6% of patients experienced new or recurrent ischemic events between radiotherapy and the onset of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The relative risk of HFpEF increases with increasing cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion exposure during contemporary conformal breast cancer radiotherapy. These data emphasize the importance of radiotherapy techniques that limit MCRD during breast cancer treatment. Moreover, these data provide further support for the importance of coronary microvascular compromise in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.</p></sec>

Association Between Duration of Resuscitation and Favorable Outcome After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little evidence guides the appropriate duration of resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and case features justifying longer or shorter durations are ill defined. We estimated the impact of resuscitation duration on the probability of favorable functional outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using a large, multicenter cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a secondary analysis of a North American, single-blind, multicenter, cluster-randomized, clinical trial (ROC-PRIMED [Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Prehospital Resuscitation Using an Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed]) of consecutive adults with nontraumatic, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emerg</span></strong>ency medical services–treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Primary exposure was duration of resuscitation in minutes (onset of professional resuscitation to return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC] or termination of resuscitation).

Radiation inhibits salivary gland function by promoting STIM1 cleavage by caspase-3 and loss of SOCE through a TRPM2-dependent pathway
<p>Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) is critical for salivary gland fluid secretion. We report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion treatment caused persistent salivary gland dysfunction by activating a TRPM2-dependent mitochondrial pathway, leading to caspase-3–mediated cleavage of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and loss of SOCE. After <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation, acinar cells from the submandibular glands of <i>TRPM2</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup>, but not those from <i>TRPM2</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice, displayed an increase in the concentrations of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reactive oxygen species, a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, and activation of caspase-3, which was associated with a sustained decrease in STIM1 abundance and attenuation of SOCE. In a salivary gland cell line, silencing the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter or caspase-3 or treatment with inhibitors of TRPM2 or caspase-3 prevented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation-induced loss of STIM1 and SOCE. Expression of exogenous STIM1 in the salivary glands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ated mice increased SOCE and fluid secretion. We suggest that targeting the mechanisms underlying the loss of STIM1 would be a potentially useful approach for preserving salivary gland function after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion therapy.</p>

A lipase-independent pathway of lipid release and immune modulation by adipocytes
<p>To meet systemic metabolic needs, adipocytes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e fatty acids and glycerol through the action of neutral lipases.

Adipose tissue from lean mice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed ~1% of its lipid content per day via exosomes ex vivo, a rate that more than doubles in obese animals. AdExos and associated factors were sufficient to induce in vitro differentiation of bone marrow precursors into adipose tissue macrophage–like cells.

Regulating the femtosecond excited-state lifetime of a single molecule
<p>The key to controlling reactions of molecules induced with the current of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip is the ultrashort intermediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed ionic state. The initial condition of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state is set by the energy and position of the injected current; thereafter, its dynamics determines the reaction outcome. We show that a STM can directly and controllably influence the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state dynamics. For the STM-induced desorption of toluene molecules from the Si(111)-7x7 surface, as the tip approaches the molecule, the probability of manipulation drops by two orders of magnitude. A two-channel quenching of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state is proposed, consisting of an invariant surface channel and a tip height–dependent channel. We conclude that picometer tip proximity regulates the lifetime of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state from 10 femtoseconds to less than 0.1 femtoseconds.</p>

PAF1 regulation of promoter-proximal pause release via enhancer activation
<p>Gene expression in metazoans is regulated by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter-proximal pausing and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e. Previously, we showed that Pol II–associated factor 1 (PAF1) modulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of paused Pol II into productive elongation. Here, we found that PAF1 occupies transcriptional enhancers and restrains hyperactivation of a subset of these enhancers. Enhancer activation as the result of PAF1 loss <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>es Pol II from paused promoters of nearby PAF1 target genes. Knockout of PAF1-regulated enhancers attenuates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of paused Pol II on PAF1 target genes without major interference in the establishment of pausing at their cognate promoters. Thus, a subset of enhancers can primarily modulate gene expression by controlling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of paused Pol II in a PAF1-dependent manner.</p>

Spatiotemporal Coupling of Vessel Cavitation and Discharge of Stored Xylem Water in a Tree Sapling
<p>Water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e from stem internal storage compartments is thought to minimize the risk of vessel cavitation. Based on this concept, one would expect that water storage compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under drought stress, and potentially refill after soil saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>es stored water and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive drought stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely water-filled even under severe drought stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem water potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of water stored in the xylem matrix is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary water contributes to overall stem water storage under drought but is not used primarily for the prevention of drought-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

Heat Shock Protein HSP101 Affects the Release of Ribosomal Protein mRNAs for Recovery after Heat Shock
<p>Heat shock (HS) is known to have a profound impact on gene expression at different levels, such as inhibition of protein synthesis, in which HS blocks translation initiation and induces the sequestration of mRNAs into stress granules (SGs) or P-bodies for storage and/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong>. SGs prevent the degradation of the stored mRNAs, which can be reengaged into translation in the recovery period. However, little is known on the mRNAs stored during the stress, how these mRNAs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed from SGs afterward, and what the functional importance is of this process. In this work, we report that Arabidopsis <i>HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101</i> (<i>HSP101</i>) knockout mutant (<i>hsp101</i>) presented a defect in translation recovery and SG dissociation after HS. Using RNA sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation approaches, we show that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) were preferentially stored during HS and that these mRNAs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed and translated in an HSP101-dependent manner during recovery. By <sup>15</sup>N incorporation and polysome profile analyses, we observed that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed mRNAs contributed to the production of new ribosomes to enhance translation. We propose that, after HS, HSP101 is required for the efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of RP mRNAs from SGs resulting in a rapid restoration of the translation machinery by producing new RPs.</p>

Diurnal Solar Energy Conversion and Photoprotection in Rice Canopies
<p>Genetic improvement of photosynthetic performance of cereal crops and increasing the efficiency with which solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion is converted into biomass has recently become a major focus for crop physiologists and breeders. The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire crop lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ance was measured in five cultivars of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion. This relationship differed substantially from that observed for conventional short term light response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. Genotypic variation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ance at which energy flux into photoprotective dissipation became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, estimated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

Evolutionary and Functional Analysis of Membrane-Bound NAC Transcription Factor Genes in Soybean
<p>Functional divergence is thought to be an important evolutionary driving force for the retention of duplicate genes. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) membrane-bound NAC transcription factor (NTL) genes. NTLs are thought to be components of stress signaling and unique in their requirement for proteolytic cleavage to free them from the membrane. Most of the 15 <i>GmNTL</i> genes appear to have evolved under strong purifying selection. By analyzing the phylogenetic tree and gene synteny, we identified seven duplicate gene pairs generated by the latest whole-genome duplication. The members of each pair were shown to have variously diverged at the transcriptional (organ specificity and responsiveness to stress), posttranscriptional (alternative splicing), and protein (proteolysis-mediated membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e and transactivation activity) levels. The dormant (full-length protein) and active (protein without a transmembrane motif) forms of one pair of duplicated gene products (GmNTL1/GmNLT11) were each separately constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The heteroexpression of active but not dormant forms of these proteins caused improved tolerance to abiotic stresses, suggesting that membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e was required for their functionality. Arabidopsis carrying the dormant form of GmNTL1 was more tolerant to hydrogen peroxide, which induces its membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e. Tolerance was not increased in the line carrying dormant GmNTL11, which was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ed by hydrogen peroxide treatment. Thus, NTL-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e pattern changes may cause phenotypic divergence. It was concluded that a variety of functional divergences contributed to the retention of these <i>GmNTL</i> duplicates.</p>

Heart Failure Stages Among Older Adults in the Community
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects older adults, little data exist regarding the prevalence of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF stages among older individuals in the community. Additionally, the role of contemporary measures of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction in defining HF stages is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HF stages were classified in 6118 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (67–91 years of age) at the fifth study visit as follows: A (asymptomatic with HF risk factors but no cardiac structural or functional abnormalities), B (asymptomatic with structural abnormalities, defined as left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or dysfunction, or significant valvular disease), C1 (clinical HF without prior hospitalization), and C2 (clinical HF with earlier hospitalization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using the traditional definitions of HF stages, only 5% of examined participants were free of HF risk factors or structural heart disease (Stage 0), 52% were categorized as Stage A, 30% Stage B, 7% Stage C1, and 6% Stage C2. Worse HF stage was associated with a greater risk of incident HF hospitalization or death at a median follow-up of 608 days. Left ventricular (LV) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the sample from Stage A to B and improved the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV structure, systolic function (based on LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction and longitudinal strain), and diastolic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with risk of incident HF hospitalization or death in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at risk for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based samples. LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction is robustly preserved in at least two-thirds of older adults with prevalent HF (Stage C), highlighting the burden of HF with preserved LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction in the elderly. LV diastolic function and longitudinal strain provide incremental prognostic value beyond conventional measures of LV structure and LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction in identifying persons at risk for HF hospitalization or death.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier tissue plasminogen activator treatment improves ischemic stroke outcome, but aspects of the time-benefit relationship still not well delineated are: (1) the degree of additional benefit accrued with treatment in the first 60 minutes after onset, and (2) the shape of the time-benefit curve through 4.5 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed patients who had acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4.5 hours of onset from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke US national program.

URI is required to maintain intestinal architecture during ionizing radiation
<p>Ionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion (IR) can cause gastrointestinal syndrome (GIS), a lethal disorder, by means of unknown mechanisms. We show that high-dose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation increases unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI) levels in mouse intestinal crypt, but organ regeneration correlates with URI reductions. URI overexpression in intestine protects mice from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion-induced GIS, whereas halving URI expression sensitizes mice to IR. URI specifically inhibits β-catenin in stem cell–like label-retaining (LR) cells, which are essential for organ regeneration after IR. URI reduction activates β-catenin–induced c-MYC expression, causing proliferation of and DNA damage to LR cells, rendering them radiosensitive. Therefore, URI labels LR cells which promote tissue regeneration in response to high-dose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation, and c-MYC inhibitors could be countermeasures for humans at risk of developing GIS.</p>

AIBP-mediated cholesterol efflux instructs hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell fate
<p>Hypercholesterolemia, the driving force of atherosclerosis, accelerates the expansion and mobilization of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The molecular determinants connecting hypercholesterolemia with hematopoiesis are unclear. Here, we report that a somite-derived prohematopoietic cue, AIBP, orchestrates HSPC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emerg</span></strong>ence from the hemogenic endothelium, a type of specialized endothelium manifesting hematopoietic potential. Mechanistically, AIBP-mediated cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">efflux</span></strong> activates endothelial Srebp2, the master transcription factor for cholesterol biosynthesis, which in turn transactivates Notch and promotes HSPC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emerg</span></strong>ence. Srebp2 inhibition impairs hypercholesterolemia-induced HSPC expansion. Srebp2 activation and Notch up-regulation are associated with HSPC expansion in hypercholesterolemic human subjects. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) indicate that Srebp2 transregulates Notch pathway genes required for hematopoiesis. Our studies outline an AIBP-regulated Srebp2-dependent paradigm for HSPC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emerg</span></strong>ence in development and HPSC expansion in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.</p>

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart pumps blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This pumping function is achieved through synchronous contraction of billions of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular calcium. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly couple external electrical impulses to the triggering of calcium ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e from intracellular stores and subsequent activation of force-producing proteins, a process termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation-contraction (E-C) coupling. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type calcium channel with the calcium-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of calcium ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold protein called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e during E-C coupling. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C coupling, reduced pumping capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and function as a transcription factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addition to its “day job” as a structural protein, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings

The belt extends across the D-ring and comprises protons produced through cosmic ray albedo neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> and multiple charge-exchange reactions. These protons are lost to atmospheric neutrals and D-ring dust. Strong proton depletions that map onto features on the D-ring indicate a highly structured and diverse dust environment near Saturn.</p>

A gut feeling
<p>The anatomist Friedrich S. Merkel predicted in 1880 that sensory systems are composed of epithelial cells and sensory nerves, which together transform environmental cues into neural signals that trigger our rich sensory experiences (<i>1</i>). We now know that this hypothesis mostly holds true for the canonical senses of vision, hearing, taste, and touch. Perhaps surprisingly, the peripheral outposts of these classical sensory systems (eyes, ears, tongue, and skin) are dwarfed by the human body's largest sensory organ—the gut. Enteroendocrine cells, which are rare epithelial cells that decorate the gut lining, have long been suspected to be sensory receptor cells that inform the brain about ingested nutrients (<i>2</i>). Since their description, these cells were assumed to play a role in metabolism and gut physiology by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>ing slow-acting peptide hormones that stimulate neurons throughout the gut and in the brain. On page 1219 of this issue, Kaelberer <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) challenge this view by demonstrating that gut enteroendocrine cells locally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>e sensory nerves through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of the neurotransmitter glutamate. A recent study of enterochromaffin cells, a subset of enteroendocrine cells, also found that gut signals are transmitted at epithelial-neural synapses through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">releas</span></strong>e of the neurotransmitter serotonin (<i>4</i>). Together, these findings overturn a decades-old dogma that enteroendocrine cells signal exclusively through hormones.</p>

The Global Virome Project
<p>Outbreaks of novel and deadly viruses highlight global vulnerability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emerg</span></strong>ing diseases, with many having massive health and economic impacts.

Light curves of the neutron star merger GW170817/SSS17a: Implications for r-process nucleosynthesis
<p>On 17 August 2017, gravitational waves (GWs) were detected from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">burst</span></strong>, GRB 170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radioact</span></strong>ively powered transient resulting from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion of neutron-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong>, and rapid color evolution are consistent with multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>a components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that neutron star mergers play a role in rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

Attosecond-resolved photoionization of chiral molecules
<p>Chiral light-matter interactions have been investigated for two centuries, leading to the discovery of many chiroptical processes used for discrimination of enantiomers. Whereas most chiroptical effects result from a response of bound electrons, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoion</span></strong>ization can produce much stronger chiral signals that manifest as asymmetries in the angular distribution of the photoelectrons along the light-propagation axis.

The asymmetric temporal shape of electron wave packets <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">emitt</span></strong>ed through an autoionizing state further reveals the chiral character of strongly correlated electronic dynamics.</p>

Neutron scattering in the proximate quantum spin liquid α-RuCl<sub>3</sub>

We discovered highly unusual signals, including a column of scattering over a large energy interval around the Brillouin zone center, which is very stable with temperature. This finding is consistent with scattering from the Majorana <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ations of a KQSL.

Tudor-SN–mediated endonucleolytic decay of human cell microRNAs promotes G<sub>1</sub>/S phase transition
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. The pathways that mediate mature miRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> are less well understood than those that mediate miRNA biogenesis. We found that functional miRNAs are degraded in human cells by the endonuclease Tudor-SN (TSN). In vitro, recombinant TSN initiated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> of both protein-free and Argonaute 2–loaded miRNAs via endonucleolytic cleavage at CA and UA dinucleotides, preferentially at scissile bonds located more than five nucleotides away from miRNA ends. Cellular targets of TSN-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> defined using microRNA sequencing followed this rule. Inhibiting TSN-mediated miRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of TSN inhibited cell cycle progression by up-regulating a cohort of miRNAs that down-regulates mRNAs that encode proteins critical for the G<sub>1</sub>-to-S phase transition.

Photosensitized, energy transfer-mediated organometallic catalysis through electronically excited nickel(II)
<p>Transition metal catalysis has traditionally relied on organometallic complexes that can cycle through a series of ground-state oxidation levels to achieve a series of discrete yet fundamental fragment-coupling steps. The viability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state organometallic catalysis via direct photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation has been demonstrated. Although the utility of triplet sensitization by energy transfer has long been known as a powerful activation mode in organic photochemistry, it is surprising to recognize that photosensitization mechanisms to access <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state organometallic catalysts have lagged far behind.

The B-Box-Containing MicroProtein miP1a/BBX31 Regulates Photomorphogenesis and UV-B Protection
<p>The bZIP transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) represents a major hub in the light-signaling cascade both under visible and UV-B light. The mode of transcriptional regulation of <i>HY5</i>, especially under UV-B light, is not well characterized. B-BOX (BBX) transcription factors regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription and also posttranscriptionally modulate HY5 to control photomorphogenesis under white light. Here, we identify BBX31 as a key signaling intermediate in visible and UV-B light signal transduction in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>BBX31</i> expression is induced by UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion in a fluence-dependent manner. HY5 directly binds to the promoter of <i>BBX31</i> and regulates its transcript levels. Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of <i>BBX31</i> indicate that it acts as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis under white light but is a positive regulator of UV-B signaling. Genetic interaction studies suggest that <i>BBX31</i> regulates photomorphogenesis independent of <i>HY5</i>. We found no evidence for a direct BBX31-HY5 interaction, and they primarily regulate different sets of genes in white light. Under high doses of UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, BBX31 promotes the accumulation of UV-protective flavonoids and phenolic compounds. It enhances tolerance to UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion by regulating genes involved in photoprotection and DNA repair in a HY5-dependent manner. Under UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ion, overexpression of <i>BBX31</i> enhances <i>HY5</i> transcriptional levels in a UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8-dependent manner, suggesting that BBX31 might regulate <i>HY5</i> transcription.</p>

Auxin Contributes to the Intraorgan Regulation of Gene Expression in Response to Shade
<p>Plants sense and respond to light via multiple photoreceptors including phytochrome. The decreased ratio of red to far-red light that occurs under a canopy triggers shade-avoidance responses, which allow plants to compete with neighboring plants. The leaf acts as a photoperceptive organ in this response. In this study, we investigated how the shade stimulus is spatially processed within the cotyledon. We performed transcriptome analysis on microtissue samples collected from vascular and nonvascular regions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) cotyledons. In addition, we mechanically isolated and analyzed the vascular tissue. More genes were up-regulated by the shade stimulus in vascular tissues than in mesophyll and epidermal tissues. The genes up-regulated in the vasculature were functionally divergent and included many auxin-responsive genes, suggesting that various physiological/developmental processes might be controlled by shade stimulus in the vasculature. We then investigated the spatial regulation of these genes in the vascular tissues. A small vascular region within a cotyledon was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ated with far-red light, and the response was compared with that when the whole seedling was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ated with far-red light. Most of the auxin-responsive genes were not fully induced by the local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ation, suggesting that perception of the shade stimulus requires that a wider area be exposed to far-red light or that a certain position in the mesophyll and epidermis of the cotyledon be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ated. This result was consistent with a previous report that auxin synthesis genes are up-regulated in the periphery of the cotyledon. Hence, auxin acts as an important intraorgan signaling factor that controls the vascular shade response within the cotyledon.</p>

Our results demonstrate that the decrease in leaf growth in UV-B-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irradi</span></strong>ated leaves is a consequence of a reduction in cell production and a shortened growth zone (GZ). To determine the molecular pathways involved in UV-B inhibition of leaf growth, we performed RNA sequencing on isolated GZ tissues of control and UV-B-exposed plants. Our results show a link between the observed leaf growth inhibition and the expression of specific cell cycle and developmental genes, including growth-regulating factors (GRFs) and transcripts for proteins participating in different hormone pathways. Interestingly, the decrease in the GZ size correlates with a decrease in the concentration of GA19, the immediate precursor of the active gibberellin, GA1, by UV-B in this zone, which is regulated, at least in part, by the expression of GRF1 and possibly other transcription factors of the GRF family.</p>

Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal decomposition of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> in which lignin and carbohydrates are both degraded. Mechanistic studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> coupled with comparative genomic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their evolutionary origins, but the complete suite of genes necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylogenomic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in gene family diversification rates that are correlated with evolution of WR, using data from 62 fungal genomes. We detected 409 gene families that appear to be evolutionarily correlated with WR. The identified gene families encode well-characterized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as well as 73 gene families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 identified gene families are present in the genome of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results illuminate the complexity of WR and suggest that its evolution has involved a general elaboration of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">decay</span></strong> apparatus, including numerous gene families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

Molecular Adaptation during a Rapid Adaptive Radiation
<p>“Explosive” adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions on islands remain one of the most puzzling evolutionary phenomena and the evolutionary genetic processes behind such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions remain unclear. Rapid morphological and ecological evolution during island <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions suggests that many genes may be under fairly strong selection, although this remains untested. Here, we report that during a rapid recent diversification in the Hawaiian endemic plant genus <i>Schiedea</i> (<i>Caryophyllaceae</i>), 5 in 36 studied genes evolved under positive selection. Positively selected genes are involved in defence mechanisms, photosynthesis, and reproduction. Comparison with eight mainland plant groups demonstrates both the relaxation of purifying selection and more widespread positive selection in Hawaiian <i>Schiedea</i>. This provides compelling evidence that adaptive evolution of protein-coding genes may play a significant role during island adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiat</span></strong>ions.</p>

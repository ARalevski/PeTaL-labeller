Synthesis of FeH<sub>5</sub>: A layered structure with atomic hydrogen slabs
<p>High pressure promotes the formation of polyhydrides with unusually high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-to-metal ratios. These polyhydrides have complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>ic sublattices. We synthesized iron pentahydride (FeH<sub>5</sub>) by a direct reaction between iron and H<sub>2</sub> above 130 gigapascals in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. FeH<sub>5</sub> exhibits a structure built of atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> only. It consists of intercalated layers of quasicubic FeH<sub>3</sub> units and four-plane slabs of thin atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>. The distribution of the valence electron density indicates a bonding between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> and iron atoms but none between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> atoms, presenting a two-dimensional metallic character. The discovery of FeH<sub>5</sub> suggests a low-pressure path to make materials that approach bulk dense atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>.</p>

Chemical interactions between Saturn’s atmosphere and its rings
<p>The Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft made close-up measurements of Saturn’s ionosphere and upper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e in the 1970s and 1980s that suggested a chemical interaction between the rings and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e. Exploring this interaction provides information on ring composition and the influence on Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e from infalling material. The Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer sampled in situ the region between the D ring and Saturn during the spacecraft’s Grand Finale phase. We used these measurements to characterize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic structure and material influx from the rings. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic He/H<sub>2</sub> ratio is 10 to 16%. Volatile compounds from the rings (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e; carbon monoxide and/or molecular nitrogen), as well as larger organic-bearing grains, are flowing inward at a rate of 4800 to 45,000 kilograms per second.</p>

Dust grains fall from Saturn’s D-ring into its equatorial upper atmosphere
<p>The sizes of Saturn’s ring particles range from meters (boulders) to nanometers (dust). Determination of the rings’ ages depends on loss processes, including the transport of dust into Saturn’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e. During the Grand Finale orbits of the Cassini spacecraft, its instruments measured tiny dust grains that compose the innermost D-ring of Saturn. The nanometer-sized dust experiences collisions with exospheric (upper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> and molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>, which forces it to fall from the ring into the ionosphere and lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e. We used the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument to detect and characterize this dust transport and also found that diffusion dominates above and near the altitude of peak ionospheric density. This mechanism results in a mass deposition into the equatorial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e of ~5 kilograms per second, constraining the age of the D-ring.</p>

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes
<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a plume of material erupts from cracks in the ice. The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials. The relatively high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e from CO<sub>2</sub> in Enceladus’ ocean.</p>

Mars’ atmospheric history derived from upper-atmosphere measurements of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar
<p>The history of Mars’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e is important for understanding the geological evolution and potential habitability of the planet. We determine the amount of gas lost to space through time using measurements of the upper-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic structure made by the Mars <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft. We derive the structure of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar between the homopause and exobase altitudes. Fractionation of argon occurs as a result of loss of gas to space by pickup-ion sputtering, which preferentially removes the lighter atom. The measurements require that 66% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic argon has been lost to space. Thus, a large fraction of Mars’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic gas has been lost to space, contributing to the transition in climate from an early, warm, wet environment to today’s cold, dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p>Metals that are active catalysts for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–melting temperature metals (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten metal alloy catalysts for pyrolysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> and carbon. All solid catalysts previously used for this reaction have been deactivated by carbon deposition. In the molten alloy system, the insoluble carbon floats to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi alloy achieved 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products. Calculations show that the active metals in the molten alloys are atomically dispersed and negatively charged. There is a correlation between the amount of charge on the atoms and their catalytic activity.</p>

Aqueous Au-Pd colloids catalyze selective CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation to CH<sub>3</sub>OH with O<sub>2</sub> under mild conditions
<p>The selective oxidation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e, the primary component of natural gas, remains an important challenge in catalysis. We used colloidal gold-palladium nanoparticles, rather than the same nanoparticles supported on titanium oxide, to oxidize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol with high selectivity (92%) in aqueous solution at mild temperatures. Then, using isotopically labeled oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as an oxidant in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>,</sub> we demonstrated that the resulting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol incorporated a substantial fraction (70%) of gas-phase O<sub>2</sub>. More oxygenated products were formed than the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> consumed, suggesting that the controlled breakdown of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e, which subsequently incorporates molecular oxygen through a radical process. If a source of methyl radicals can be established, then the selective oxidation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol using molecular oxygen is possible.</p>

Selective anaerobic oxidation of methane enables direct synthesis of methanol
<p>Direct functionalization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e in natural gas remains a key challenge. We present a direct stepwise method for converting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol with high selectivity (~97%) over a copper-containing zeolite, based on partial oxidation with water. The activation in helium at 673 kelvin (K), followed by consecutive catalyst exposures to 7 bars of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e and then water at 473 K, consistently produced 0.204 mole of CH<sub>3</sub>OH per mole of copper in zeolite. Isotopic labeling confirmed water as the source of oxygen to regenerate the zeolite active centers and renders <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol desorption energetically favorable. On the basis of in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we propose a mechanism involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e oxidation at Cu<sup>II</sup> oxide active centers, followed by Cu<sup>I</sup> reoxidation by water with concurrent formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>.</p>

Low-temperature activation of methane on the IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e undergoes highly facile C–H bond cleavage on the stoichiometric IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface. From temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy experiments, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e molecularly adsorbed as a strongly bound σ complex on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) and that a large fraction of the adsorbed complexes underwent C–H bond cleavage at temperatures as low as 150 kelvin (K). The initial dissociation probability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) decreased from 80 to 20% with increasing surface temperature from 175 to 300 K. We estimate that the activation energy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e C–H bond cleavage is 9.5 kilojoule per mole (kJ/mol) lower than the binding energy of the adsorbed precursor on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110), and equal to a value of ~28.5 kJ/mol. Low-temperature activation may avoid unwanted side reactions in the development of catalytic processes to selectively convert <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e to value-added products.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. Metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> becomes metallic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the atomic density. The properties are those of an atomic metal. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington dissociative transition to atomic metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> in the laboratory.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)
<sec><title>Vibrating Water Apart</title><p>The main route for producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> for industrial chemical synthesis is steam reforming, in which water and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e react at high temperatures on nickel catalysts to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> and carbon dioxide.

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet
<p>Stellar heating causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>es of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape. These extended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>es are difficult to observe because their main spectral signature—neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> at ultraviolet wavelengths—is strongly absorbed by interstellar medium. We report the detection of the near-infrared triplet of neutral helium in the transiting warm Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-11b by using ground-based, high-resolution observations. The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average absorption depth of 1.08 ± 0.05%. Interpreting absorption spectra with three-dimensional simulations of the planet’s upper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e suggests that it extends beyond 5 planetary radii, with a large-scale height and a helium mass loss rate of ≲3 × 10<sup>5</sup> grams per second. A net blue-shift of the absorption might be explained by high-altitude winds flowing at 3 kilometers per second from day to night-side.</p>

Selective functionalization of methane, ethane, and higher alkanes by cerium photocatalysis

High catalytic efficiency (turnover numbers up to 2900 for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e and 9700 for ethane) and selectivity were achieved using abundant, inexpensive cerium salts as photocatalysts. Ligand-to-metal charge transfer excitation generated alkoxy radicals from simple alcohols that in turn acted as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> atom transfer catalysts. The mixed-phase gas/liquid reaction was adapted to continuous flow, enabling the efficient use of gaseous feedstocks in scalable photocatalytic transformations.</p>

Direct observation of individual hydrogen atoms at trapping sites in a ferritic steel

The simulations and a comparison with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic observations show that nearly all nucleation throughout the present-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addition to sulfuric acid.

Methane production from coal by a single methanogen

Insulator-metal transition in dense fluid deuterium
<p>Dense fluid metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> occupies the interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and many extrasolar planets, where pressures reach millions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>es. Planetary structure models must describe accurately the transition from the outer molecular envelopes to the interior metallic regions. We report optical measurements of dynamically compressed fluid deuterium to 600 gigapascals (GPa) that reveal an increasing refractive index, the onset of absorption of visible light near 150 GPa, and a transition to metal-like reflectivity (exceeding 30%) near 200 GPa, all at temperatures below 2000 kelvin. Our measurements and analysis address existing discrepancies between static and dynamic experiments for the insulator-metal transition in dense fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> isotopes. They also provide new benchmarks for the theoretical calculations used to construct planetary models.</p>

Global extent of rivers and streams

At the global scale, the total river-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e flux of trace gasses such as carbon dioxide depends on the proportion of Earth’s surface that is covered by the fluvial network, yet the total surface area of rivers and streams is poorly constrained. We used a global database of planform river hydromorphology and a statistical approach to show that global river and stream surface area at mean annual discharge is 773,000 ± 79,000 square kilometers (0.58 ± 0.06%) of Earth’s nonglaciated land surface, an area 44 ± 15% larger than previous spatial estimates.

Asymmetric nucleophilic fluorination under hydrogen bonding phase-transfer catalysis
<p>Common anionic nucleophiles such as those derived from inorganic salts have not been used for enantioselective catalysis because of their insolubility. Here, we report that merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bonding and phase-transfer catalysis provides an effective mode of activation for nucleophiles that are insoluble in organic solvents. This catalytic manifold relies on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bonding complexation to render nucleophiles soluble and reactive, while simultaneously inducing asymmetry in the ensuing transformation. We demonstrate the concept using a chiral bis-urea catalyst to form a tridentate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bonding complex with fluoride from its cesium salt, thereby enabling highly efficient enantioselective ring opening of episulfonium ion. This fluorination method is synthetically valuable considering the scarcity of alternative protocols and points the way to wider application of the catalytic approach with diverse anionic nucleophiles.</p>

Mechanically robust, readily repairable polymers via tailored noncovalent cross-linking
<p>Expanding the range of healable materials is an important challenge for sustainable societies. Noncrystalline, high-molecular-weight polymers generally form mechanically robust materials, which, however, are difficult to repair once they are fractured. This is because their polymer chains are heavily entangled and diffuse too sluggishly to unite fractured surfaces within reasonable time scales. Here we report that low-molecular-weight polymers, when cross-linked by dense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bonds, yield mechanically robust yet readily repairable materials, despite their extremely slow diffusion dynamics. A key was to use thiourea, which anomalously forms a zigzag <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-bonded array that does not induce unfavorable crystallization. Another key was to incorporate a structural element for activating the exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-bonded pairs, which enables the fractured portions to rejoin readily upon compression.</p>

Massive blow-out craters formed by hydrate-controlled methane expulsion from the Arctic seafloor
<p>Widespread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e release from thawing Arctic gas hydrates is a major concern, yet the processes, sources, and fluxes involved remain unconstrained. We present geophysical data documenting a cluster of kilometer-wide craters and mounds from the Barents Sea floor associated with large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e expulsion. Combined with ice sheet/gas hydrate modeling, our results indicate that during glaciation, natural gas migrated from underlying hydrocarbon reservoirs and was sequestered extensively as subglacial gas hydrates. Upon ice sheet retreat, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e from this hydrate reservoir concentrated in massive mounds before being abruptly released to form craters. We propose that these processes were likely widespread across past glaciated petroleum provinces and that they also provide an analog for the potential future destabilization of subglacial gas hydrate reservoirs beneath contemporary ice sheets.</p>

Extensive water ice within Ceres’ aqueously altered regolith: Evidence from nuclear spectroscopy

Using nuclear spectroscopy data acquired by NASA’s Dawn mission, we determined the concentrations of elemental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>, iron, and potassium on Ceres. The data show that surface materials were processed by the action of water within the interior. The non-icy portion of Ceres’ carbon-bearing regolith contains similar amounts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> to those present in aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites; however, the concentration of iron on Ceres is lower than in the aforementioned chondrites. This allows for the possibility that Ceres experienced modest ice-rock fractionation, resulting in differences between surface and bulk composition.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous liquid states. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Structural basis for methylphosphonate biosynthesis

The associated enhanced release of oceanic heat has reduced winter sea-ice formation at a rate now comparable to losses from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic thermodynamic forcing, thus explaining the recent reduction in sea-ice cover in the eastern Eurasian Basin.

The geologic history of seawater pH
<p>Although pH is a fundamental property of Earth’s oceans, critical to our understanding of seawater biogeochemistry, its long-timescale geologic history is poorly constrained. We constrain seawater pH through time by accounting for the cycles of the major components of seawater. We infer an increase from early Archean pH values between ~6.5 and 7.0 and Phanerozoic values between ~7.5 and 9.0, which was caused by a gradual decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in response to solar brightening, alongside a decrease in hydrothermal exchange between seawater and the ocean crust. A lower pH in Earth’s early oceans likely affected the kinetics of chemical reactions associated with the origin of life, the energetics of early metabolisms, and climate through the partitioning of CO<sub>2</sub> between the oceans and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e.</p>

Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive radiative cooling draws heat from surfaces and radiates it into space as infrared radiation to which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>e is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared radiation flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atmospher</span></strong>ic window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime radiative cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting radiative cooling as a viable energy technology.</p>

Homogenized halides and alkali cation segregation in alloyed organic-inorganic perovskites
<p>The role of the alkali metal cations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>e perovskite solar cells is not well understood. Using synchrotron-based nano–x-ray fluorescence and complementary measurements, we found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>e distribution becomes homogenized upon addition of cesium iodide, either alone or with rubidium iodide, for substoichiometric, stoichiometric, and overstoichiometric preparations, where the lead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>e is varied with respect to organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>e precursors. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>e homogenization coincides with long-lived charge carrier decays, spatially homogeneous carrier dynamics (as visualized by ultrafast microscopy), and improved photovoltaic device performance. We found that rubidium and potassium phase-segregate in highly concentrated clusters. Alkali metals are beneficial at low concentrations, where they homogenize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>e distribution, but at higher concentrations, they form recombination-active second-phase clusters.</p>

A general catalytic β-C–H carbonylation of aliphatic amines to β-lactams
<p>Methods for the synthesis and functionalization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es are intrinsically important to a variety of chemical applications. We present a general carbon-hydrogen bond activation process that combines readily available aliphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es and the feedstock gas carbon monoxide to form synthetically versatile value-added amide products. The operationally straightforward palladium-catalyzed process exploits a distinct reaction pathway, wherein a sterically hindered carboxylate ligand orchestrates an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e attack on a palladium anhydride to transform aliphatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es into β-lactams. The reaction is successful with a wide range of secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es and can be used as a late-stage functionalization tactic to deliver advanced, highly functionalized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e products of utility for pharmaceutical research and other areas.</p>

Catalytic intermolecular hydroaminations of unactivated olefins with secondary alkyl amines
<p>The intermolecular hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>ation of unactivated alkenes with simple dialkyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es remains an unsolved problem in organic synthesis. We report a catalytic protocol for efficient additions of cyclic and acyclic secondary alkyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es to a wide range of alkyl olefins with complete anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. In this process, carbon-nitrogen bond formation proceeds through a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>ium radical cation intermediate that is generated via electron transfer between an excited-state iridium photocatalyst and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e substrate. These reactions are redox-neutral and completely atom-economical, exhibit broad functional group tolerance, and occur readily at room temperature under visible light irradiation. Certain tertiary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e products generated through this method are formally endergonic relative to their constituent olefin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e starting materials and thus are not accessible via direct coupling with conventional ground-state catalysts.</p>

Deconstructive fluorination of cyclic amines by carbon-carbon cleavage
<p>Deconstructive functionalizations involving scission of carbon-carbon double bonds are well established.

MOF-derived cobalt nanoparticles catalyze a general synthesis of amines

Photoinduced decarboxylative borylation of carboxylic acids
<p>The conversion of widely available carboxylic acids into versatile boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s would be highly enabling for synthesis.

A simple workup allows isolation of the pinacol boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>. Experimental evidence suggests that boryl radical intermediates are involved in the process. The methodology is illustrated by the transformation of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl carboxylic acids as well as a diverse range of natural-product carboxylic acids, thereby demonstrating its broad utility and functional group tolerance.</p>

Decarboxylative borylation

Application to peptides allowed expedient preparations of α-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>o boronic acids, often with high stereoselectivity, thereby facilitating synthesis of the alkyl boronic acid drugs Velcade and Ninlaro as well as a boronic acid version of the iconic antibiotic vancomycin.

Radical-polar crossover reactions of vinylboron ate complexes
<p>Vinyl boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s are valuable substrates for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. However, boron-substituted alkenes have drawn little attention as radical acceptors, and the radical chemistry of vinylboron ate complexes is underexplored. We show here that carbon radicals add efficiently to vinylboron ate complexes and that their adduct radical anions undergo radical-polar crossover: A 1,2-alkyl/aryl shift from boron to the α-carbon sp<sup>2</sup> center provides secondary or tertiary alkyl boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s. In contrast to the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, a transition metal is not required, and two carbon-carbon bonds are formed. The valuable boronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong> moiety remains in the product and can be used in follow-up chemistry, enlarging the chemical space of the method. The cascade uses commercial starting materials and provides access to perfluoroalkylated alcohols, γ-lactones, γ-hydroxy alkylnitriles, and compounds bearing quaternary carbon centers.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e. Dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e. In addition to dop<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e, levels of serotonin and tyr<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

Delayed catalyst function enables direct enantioselective conversion of nitriles to NH<sub>2</sub>-amines
<p>Accessing enantiomerically enriched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es often demands oxidation-state adjustments, protection and deprotection processes, and purification procedures that increase cost and waste, limiting applicability. When diastereomers can be formed, one isomer is attainable. Here, we show that nitriles, largely viewed as insufficiently reactive, can be transformed directly to multifunctional unprotected homoallylic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es by enantioselective addition of a carbon-based nucleophile and diastereodivergent reduction of the resulting ketimine. Successful implementation requires that competing copper-based catalysts be present simultaneously and that the slower-forming and less reactive one engages first. This challenge was addressed by incorporation of a nonproductive side cycle, fueled selectively by inexpensive additives, to delay the function of the more active catalyst. The utility of this approach is highlighted by its application to the efficient preparation of the anticancer agent (+)-tangutorine.</p>

Carbonyl catalysis enables a biomimetic asymmetric Mannich reaction
<p>Chiral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es are widely used as catalysts in asymmetric synthesis to activate carbonyl groups for α-functionalization. Carbonyl catalysis reverses that strategy by using a carbonyl group to activate a primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e. Inspired by biological carbonyl catalysis, which is exemplified by reactions of pyridoxal-dependent enzymes, we developed an N-quaternized pyridoxal catalyst for the asymmetric Mannich reaction of glycinate with aryl <i>N</i>-diphenylphosphinyl imines. The catalyst exhibits high activity and stereoselectivity, likely enabled by enzyme-like cooperative bifunctional activation of the substrates. Our work demonstrates the catalytic utility of the pyridoxal moiety in asymmetric catalysis.</p>

Synthesis of partially and fully fused polyaromatics by annulative chlorophenylene dimerization
<p>Since the discovery by Ullmann and Bielecki in 1901, reductive dimerization (or homocoupling) of aryl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>es has been extensively exploited for the generation of a range of biaryl-based functional molecules. In contrast to the single-point connection in these products, edge-sharing fused aromatic systems have not generally been accessible from simple aryl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>es via annulation cascades. Here we report a single-step synthesis of fused aromatics with a triphenylene core by the palladium-catalyzed annulative dimerization of structurally and functionally diverse chlorophenylenes through double carbon-hydrogen bond activation. The partially fused polyaromatics can be transformed into fully fused, small graphene nanoribbons, which are otherwise difficult to synthesize. This simple, yet powerful, method allows access to functional π-systems of interest in optoelectronics research.</p>

A general, modular method for the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of alkylboronate esters

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells
<p>Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, device performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic devices. We report that continuous light illumination leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Correlated, in situ structural and device characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>e planar device, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%. The lattice expansion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor.

Metabolic recycling of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase supports breast cancer biomass
<p>Ammonia is a ubiquitous by-product of cellular metabolism; however, the biological consequences of ammonia production are not fully understood, especially in cancer. We found that ammonia is not merely a toxic waste product but is recycled into central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>o acid metabolism to maximize nitrogen utilization. In our experiments, human breast cancer cells primarily assimilated ammonia through reductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>ation catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH); secondary reactions enabled other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>o acids, such as proline and aspartate, to directly acquire this nitrogen. Metabolic recycling of ammonia accelerated proliferation of breast cancer. In mice, ammonia accumulated in the tumor microenvironment and was used directly to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>o acids through GDH activity. These data show that ammonia is not only a secreted waste product but also a fundamental nitrogen source that can support tumor biomass.</p>

A multistage antimalarial targets the plasmepsins IX and X essential for invasion and egress
<p>Regulated exocytosis by secretory organelles is important for malaria parasite invasion and egress. Many parasite effector proteins, including perforins, adhesins, and proteases, are extensively proteolytically processed both pre- and postexocytosis. Here we report the multistage antiplasmodial activity of the aspartic protease inhibitor hydroxyl-ethyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e–based scaffold compound 49c. This scaffold inhibits the preexocytosis processing of several secreted rhoptry and microneme proteins by targeting the corresponding maturases plasmepsins IX (PMIX) and X (PMX), respectively. Conditional excision of PMIX revealed its crucial role in invasion, and recombinantly active PMIX and PMX cleave egress and invasion factors in a 49c-sensitive manner.</p>

Snap deconvolution: An informatics approach to high-throughput discovery of catalytic reactions
<p>We present an approach to multidimensional high-throughput discovery of catalytic coupling reactions that integrates molecular design with automated analysis and interpretation of mass spectral data. We simultaneously assessed the reactivity of three pools of compounds that shared the same functional groups (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>es, boronic acids, alkenes, and alkynes, among other groups) but carried inactive substituents having specifically designed differences in masses. The substituents were chosen such that the products from any class of reaction in multiple reaction sets would have unique differences in masses, thus allowing simultaneous identification of the products of all transformations in a set of reactants. In this way, we easily distinguished the products of new reactions from noise and known couplings. Using this method, we discovered an alkyne hydroallylation and a nickel-catalyzed variant of alkyne diarylation.</p>

Iodide management in formamidinium-lead-halide–based perovskite layers for efficient solar cells
<p>The formation of a dense and uniform thin layer on the substrates is crucial for the fabrication of high-performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) containing formamidinium with multiple cations and mixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>e anions. The concentration of defect states, which reduce a cell’s performance by decreasing the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current density, needs to be as low as possible. We show that the introduction of additional iodide ions into the organic cation solution, which are used to form the perovskite layers through an intramolecular exchanging process, decreases the concentration of deep-level defects. The defect-engineered thin perovskite layers enable the fabrication of PSCs with a certified power conversion efficiency of 22.1% in small cells and 19.7% in 1-square-centimeter cells.</p>

Photosensitized, energy transfer-mediated organometallic catalysis through electronically excited nickel(II)
<p>Transition metal catalysis has traditionally relied on organometallic complexes that can cycle through a series of ground-state oxidation levels to achieve a series of discrete yet fundamental fragment-coupling steps. The viability of excited-state organometallic catalysis via direct photoexcitation has been demonstrated. Although the utility of triplet sensitization by energy transfer has long been known as a powerful activation mode in organic photochemistry, it is surprising to recognize that photosensitization mechanisms to access excited-state organometallic catalysts have lagged far behind. Here, we demonstrate excited-state organometallic catalysis via such an activation pathway: Energy transfer from an iridium sensitizer produces an excited-state nickel complex that couples aryl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>es with carboxylic acids. Detailed mechanistic studies confirm the role of photosensitization via energy transfer.</p>

Improving efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells with photocurable fluoropolymers
<p>Organometal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>e perovskite solar cells have demonstrated high conversion efficiency but poor long-term stability against ultraviolet irradiation and water. We show that rapid light–induced free-radical polymerization at ambient temperature produces multifunctional fluorinated photopolymer coatings that confer luminescent and easy-cleaning features on the front side of the devices, while concurrently forming a strongly hydrophobic barrier toward environmental moisture on the back contact side. The luminescent photopolymers re-emit ultraviolet light in the visible range, boosting perovskite solar cells efficiency to nearly 19% under standard illumination. Coated devices reproducibly retain their full functional performance during prolonged operation, even after a series of severe aging tests carried out for more than 6 months.</p>

Quantum dot–induced phase stabilization of α-CsPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite for high-efficiency photovoltaics

Screening in crystalline liquids protects energetic carriers in hybrid perovskites
<p>Hybrid lead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">halid</span></strong>e perovskites exhibit carrier properties that resemble those of pristine nonpolar semiconductors despite static and dynamic disorder, but how carriers are protected from efficient scattering with charged defects and optical phonons is unknown. Here, we reveal the carrier protection mechanism by comparing three single-crystal lead bromide perovskites: CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>, CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>, and CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>. We observed hot fluorescence emission from energetic carriers with ~10<sup>2</sup>-picosecond lifetimes in CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub> or CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>, but not in CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>. The hot fluorescence is correlated with liquid-like molecular reorientational motions, suggesting that dynamic screening protects energetic carriers via solvation or large polaron formation on time scales competitive with that of ultrafast cooling. Similar protections likely exist for band-edge carriers. The long-lived energetic carriers may enable hot-carrier solar cells with efficiencies exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit.</p>

Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s, are formed when plant tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct plant defense at wound sites, indirect plant defense via the attraction of herbivore predators, and plant-plant communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for plants to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduction of C6-aldehydes into C6-alcohols is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde reduction remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant plants displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-alcohol production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore infestation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested wild-type plants compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> plants, which corresponded with reduced C6-alcohol levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> plants were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered photosystem II activity. Our study shows that reductases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding toxicity from volatile carbonyls and in the attraction of herbivore predators.</p>

Jasmone Hydroxylase, a Key Enzyme in the Synthesis of the Alcohol Moiety of Pyrethrin Insecticides
<p>Pyrethrins are synthesized by the plant pyrethrum (<i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>), a chrysanthemum relative. These compounds possess efficient insecticidal properties and are not toxic to humans and most vertebrates. Pyrethrum flowers, and to a smaller extent leaves, synthesize six main types of pyrethrins, which are all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s of a monoterpenoid acid moiety and an alcohol moiety derived from jasmonic acid. Here, we identified and characterized the enzyme responsible for the conversion of jasmone, a derivative of jasmonic acid, to jasmolone. Feeding pyrethrum flowers with jasmone resulted in a 4-fold increase in the concentration of free jasmolone as well as smaller but significant proportional increases in free pyrethrolone and all three type I pyrethrins. We used floral transcriptomic data to identify cytochrome P450 genes whose expression patterns were most highly correlated with that of a key gene in pyrethrin biosynthesis, <i>T. cinerariifolium chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase</i>. The candidate genes were screened for jasmone hydroxylase activity through transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves fed with jasmone. The expression of only one of these candidate genes produced jasmolone; therefore, this gene was named <i>T. cinerariifolium jasmolone hydroxylase</i> (<i>TcJMH</i>) and given the CYP designation CYP71AT148. The protein encoded by <i>TcJMH</i> localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, and microsomal preparations from <i>N. benthamiana</i> leaves expressing <i>TcJMH</i> were capable of catalyzing the hydroxylation of jasmone to jasmolone in vitro, with a <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value of 53.9 µ<sc>m</sc>. <i>TcJMH</i> was expressed almost exclusively in trichomes of floral ovaries and was induced in leaves by jasmonate.</p>

Glutathione Transferase U13 Functions in Pathogen-Triggered Glucosinolate Metabolism<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Glutathione (GSH) and indole glucosinolates (IGs) exert key functions in the immune system of the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Appropriate GSH levels are important for execution of both pre- and postinvasive disease resistance mechanisms to invasive pathogens, whereas an intact PENETRATION2 (PEN2)-pathway for IG metabolism is essential for preinvasive resistance in this species. Earlier indirect evidence suggested that the latter pathway involves conjugation of GSH with unstable products of IG metabolism and further processing of the resulting adducts to biologically active molecules. Here we describe the identification of Glutathione-<i>S</i>-Transferase class-tau member 13 (GSTU13) as an indispensable component of the PEN2 immune pathway for IG metabolism. <i>gstu13</i> mutant plants are defective in the pathogen-triggered biosynthesis of end products of the PEN2 pathway, including 4-O-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosyl-indol-3-yl formamide, indole-3-ylmethyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>e, and raphanusamic acid. In line with this metabolic defect, lack of functional GSTU13 results in enhanced disease susceptibility toward several fungal pathogens including <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>, <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>, and <i>Plectosphaerella cucumerina</i>. Seedlings of <i>gstu13</i> plants fail also to deposit the (1,3)-β-glucan cell wall polymer, callose, after recognition of the bacterial flg22 epitope. We show that GSTU13 mediates specifically the role of GSH in IG metabolism without noticeable impact on other immune functions of this tripeptide. We postulate that GSTU13 connects GSH with the pathogen-triggered PEN2 pathway for IG metabolism to deliver metabolites that may have numerous functions in the innate immune system of Arabidopsis.</p>

Coexpression Analysis Identifies Two Oxidoreductases Involved in the Biosynthesis of the Monoterpene Acid Moiety of Natural Pyrethrin Insecticides in <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>
<p>Flowers of <i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i> produce a set of compounds known collectively as pyrethrins, which are commercially important pesticides that are strongly toxic to flying insects but not to most vertebrates. A pyrethrin molecule is an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong> consisting of either trans-chrysanthemic acid or its modified form, pyrethric acid, and one of three alcohols, jasmolone, pyrethrolone, and cinerolone, that appear to be derived from jasmonic acid. Chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase (CDS), the first enzyme involved in the synthesis of trans-chrysanthemic acid, was characterized previously and its gene isolated. <i>TcCDS</i> produces free trans-chrysanthemol in addition to trans-chrysanthemyl diphosphate, but the enzymes responsible for the conversion of trans-chrysanthemol to the corresponding aldehyde and then to the acid have not been reported. We used an RNA sequencing-based approach and coexpression correlation analysis to identify several candidate genes encoding putative trans-chrysanthemol and trans-chrysanthemal dehydrogenases. We functionally characterized the proteins encoded by these genes using a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and heterologous expression in planta to demonstrate that <i>TcADH2</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemol to trans-chrysanthemal, while <i>TcALDH1</i> encodes an enzyme that oxidizes trans-chrysanthemal into trans-chrysanthemic acid. Transient coexpression of <i>TcADH2</i> and <i>TcALDH1</i> together with <i>TcCDS</i> in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves results in the production of trans-chrysanthemic acid as well as several other side products. The majority (58%) of trans-chrysanthemic acid was glycosylated or otherwise modified. Overall, these data identify key steps in the biosynthesis of pyrethrins and demonstrate the feasibility of metabolic engineering to produce components of these defense compounds in a heterologous host.</p>

Structural and Biochemical Characterization of Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductases
<p>Cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase (CCR) catalyzes the reduction of hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s using NADPH to produce hydroxycinnamyl aldehyde precursors in lignin synthesis. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of cinnamoyl-CoA reductases from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. Although SbCCR1 displayed higher affinity for caffeoyl-CoA or <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than for feruloyl-CoA, the enzyme showed significantly higher activity for the latter substrate. Through molecular docking and comparisons between the crystal structures of the <i>Vitis vinifera</i> dihydroflavonol reductase and SbCCR1, residues threonine-154 and tyrosine-310 were pinpointed as being involved in binding CoA-conjugated phenylpropanoids. Threonine-154 of SbCCR1 and other CCRs likely confers strong substrate specificity for feruloyl-CoA over other cinnamoyl-CoA thio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s, and the T154Y mutation in SbCCR1 led to broader substrate specificity and faster turnover. Through data mining using our structural and biochemical information, four additional putative <i>CCR</i> genes were discovered from sorghum genomic data. One of these, SbCCR2, displayed greater activity toward <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA than did SbCCR1, which could imply a role in the synthesis of defense-related lignin. Taken together, these findings provide knowledge about critical residues and substrate preference among CCRs and provide, to our knowledge, the first three-dimensional structure information for a CCR from a monocot species.</p>

ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma samples at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib. Their pathway analysis revealed unexpected and widespread changes in immune and inflammatory functions, as well as changes in endocrine systems, including in aldosterone function and glycemic control. At baseline, 9-protein risk scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-protein derived risk increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004). Thirty-seven proteins changed in the direction of increased risk of 49 proteins previously associated with cardiovascular and mortality risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Heretofore unknown effects of torcetrapib were revealed in immune and inflammatory functions.

Recent advances in mass spectrometry allow the identification and quantification of hundreds of lipid species. Molecular lipid profiling by mass spectrometry may improve cardiovascular risk prediction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Lipids were extracted from 685 plasma samples of the prospective population-based Bruneck Study (baseline evaluation in 2000). One hundred thirty-five lipid species from 8 different lipid classes were profiled by shotgun lipidomics with the use of a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Levels of individual species of chol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>ol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ester</span></strong>s (CEs), lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanol<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amin</span></strong>es (PEs), sphingomyelins, and triacylglycerols (TAGs) were associated with cardiovascular disease over a 10-year observation period (2000–2010, 90 incident events). Among the lipid species with the strongest predictive value were TAGs and CEs with a low carbon number and double-bond content, including TAG(54:2) and CE(16:1), as well as PE(36:5) (<i>P</i>=5.1×10<sup>−7</sup>, 2.2×10<sup>−4</sup>, and 2.5×10<sup>−3</sup>, respectively). Consideration of these 3 lipid species on top of traditional risk factors resulted in improved risk discrimination and classification for cardiovascular disease (cross-validated ΔC index, 0.0210 [95% confidence interval, 0.0010-0.0422]; integrated discrimination improvement, 0.0212 [95% confidence interval, 0.0031-0.0406]; and continuous net reclassification index, 0.398 [95% confidence interval, 0.175-0.619]).

Genome sequence of <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314
<p>Awamori is a traditional distilled beverage made from steamed Thai-Indica rice in Okinawa, Japan. For brewing the liquor, two microbes, local kuro (black) koji <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong> <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> and awamori yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> are involved. In contrast, that yeasts are used for ethanol fermentation throughout the world, a characteristic of Japanese fermentation industries is the use of <i>Aspergillus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>s as a source of enzymes for the maceration and saccharification of raw materials. Here we report the draft genome of a kuro (black) koji <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>, <i>A. luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314 (RIB 2604). The total length of nonredundant sequences was nearly 34.7 Mb, comprising approximately 2,300 contigs with 16 telomere-like sequences. In total, 11,691 genes were predicted to encode proteins. Most of the housekeeping genes, such as transcription factors and <i>N</i>-and <i>O</i>-glycosylation system, were conserved with respect to <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>. An alternative oxidase and acid-stable α-amylase regarding citric acid production and fermentation at a low pH as well as a unique glutamic peptidase were also found in the genome. Furthermore, key biosynthetic gene clusters of ochratoxin A and fumonisin B were absent when compared with <i>A. niger</i> genome, showing the safety of <i>A. luchuensis</i> for food and beverage production. This genome information will facilitate not only comparative genomics with industrial kuro-koji <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>s, but also molecular breeding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>s in improvements of awamori fermentation.</p>

The colonisation of the glenohumeral joint by <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i> is not associated with frozen shoulder but is more likely to occur after an injection into the joint
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of <i>Propionibacterium   (P.) acnes</i> in the subcutaneous fat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e of patients   undergoing shoulder surgery for frozen shoulder or instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients undergoing either an arthroscopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>ar   release or stabilisation had biopsies taken from the subcutaneous   fat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e of the shoulder at the time of surgery. These samples   were sent for culture in enrichment, and also for Nucleic Acid Amplification   testing. The prevalence of <i>P. acnes</i> and other microbes   was recorded. Fisher's exact test of binary variables was used to   calculate the association with significance set at p < 0.05.   Assessment of influence of independent variables including a pre-operative   glenohumeral injection, fat colonisation and gender, was undertaken   using binary linear regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 25 patients (53%) had <i>P. acnes</i> in   one or more tissue samples and 35 (74%) had other bacterial species.

Sterilizing immunity in the lung relies on targeting fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death
<p>Humans inhale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong> conidia daily and typically experience lifelong asymptomatic clearance. Conidial germination into tissue-invasive hyphae can occur in individuals with defects in myeloid function, although the mechanism of myeloid cell–mediated immune surveillance remains unclear. By monitoring fungal physiology in vivo, we demonstrate that lung neutrophils trigger programmed cell death with apoptosis-like features in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia, the most prevalent human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong> pathogen. An antiapoptotic protein, AfBIR1, opposes this process by inhibiting fungal caspase activation and DNA fragmentation in the murine lung. Genetic and pharmacologic studies indicate that AfBIR1 expression and activity underlie conidial susceptibility to NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase-dependent killing and, in turn, host susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis. Immune surveillance exploits a fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death pathway to maintain sterilizing immunity in the lung.</p>

Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic in total knee arthroplasty; is posterior capsular infiltration worth the risk?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic provides effective   control of pain in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).   There is little information about the added benefits of posterior   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>ar infiltration (PCI) using different combinations of local   anaesthetic agents. Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness   of the control of pain using multimodal infiltration with and without   infiltration of the posterior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial of patients scheduled   for unilateral primary TKA, 86 were assigned to be treated with   multimodal infiltration with (Group I) or without (Group II) PCI.   Routine associated analgesia included the use of bupivacaine, morphine,   ketorolac and epinephrine. All patients had spinal anaesthesia and patient-controlled   analgesia (PCA) post-operatively. A visual analogue scale (VAS)   for pain and the use of morphine were recorded 24 hours post-operatively.   Side effects of the infiltration, blood loss, and length of stay   in hospital were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no statistically significant differences between the   groups in relation to: VAS pain scores in the first 24 hours post-operatively   (p = 0.693), the use of morphine in the PCA (p = 0.647), blood loss   (p = 0.625), and length of stay (p = 0.17).

Ancient goat genomes reveal mosaic domestication in the Fertile Crescent
<p>Current genetic data are equivocal as to whether goat domestication occurred multiple times or was a singular process. We generated genomic data from 83 ancient goats (51 with genome-wide coverage) from Paleolithic to Medieval contexts throughout the Near East. Our findings demonstrate that multiple divergent ancient wild goat sources were domesticated in a dispersed process that resulted in genetically and geographically distinct Neolithic goat populations, echoing contemporaneous human divergence across the region. These early goat populations contributed differently to modern goats in Asia, Africa, and Europe. We also detect early selection for pigmentation, stature, reproduction, milking, and response to dietary change, providing 8000-year-old evidence for human agency in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>ing genome variation within a partner species.</p>

CRMP2-binding compound, edonerpic maleate, accelerates motor function recovery from brain damage
<p>Brain damage such as stroke is a devastating neurological condition that may severely compromise patient quality of life. No effective medication-mediated intervention to accelerate rehabilitation has been established. We found that a small compound, edonerpic maleate, facilitated experience-driven synaptic glutamate AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic-acid) receptor delivery and resulted in the acceleration of motor function recovery after motor cortex cryoinjury in mice in a training-dependent manner through cortical reorganization. Edonerpic bound to collapsin-response-mediator-protein 2 (CRMP2) and failed to augment recovery in CRMP2-deficient mice. Edonerpic maleate enhanced motor function recovery from internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e hemorrhage in nonhuman primates. Thus, edonerpic maleate, a neural plasticity enhancer, could be a clinically potent small compound with which to accelerate rehabilitation after brain damage.</p>

High-performance vitrimers from commodity thermoplastics through dioxaborolane metathesis
<p>Windmills, cars, and dental restoration demand polymer materials and composites that are easy to process, assemble, and recycle while exhibiting outstanding mechanical, thermal, and chemical resistance. Vitrimers, which are polymer networks able to shuffle chemical bonds through exchange reactions, could address these demands if they were prepared from existing plastics and processed with fast production rates and current equipment. We report the metathesis of dioxaborolanes, which is rapid and thermally robust, and use it to prepare vitrimers from polymers as different as poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, and high-density polyethylene that, although permanently cross-linked, can be processed multiple times by means of extrusion or injection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>ing. They show superior chemical resistance and dimensional stability and can be efficiently assembled. The strategy is applicable to polymers with backbones made of carbon-carbon single bonds.</p>

Metallosis following implantation of magnetically controlled growing rods in the treatment of scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present a case series of five patients who had revision surgery   following magnetic controlled growing rods (MGCR) for early onset   scoliosis. Metallosis was found during revision in four out of five   patients and we postulated a mechanism for rod failure based on   retrieval analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Retrieval analysis was performed on the seven explanted rods.   The mean duration of MCGR from implantation to revision was 35 months   (17 to 46). The mean age at revision was 12 years (7 to 15; four   boys, one girl).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of six out of seven rods had tissue metallosis and pseudo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e   surrounding the actuator.

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for fractures of the navicular that gives associated injuries   involving the lateral column due consideration. We have shown that   this system is reliable and reproducible and have described the   rationale for the subsequent treatment of each type.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:176–82.</p></sec>

Predicting global killer whale population collapse from PCB pollution
<p>Killer whales (<i>Orcinus orca</i>) are among the most highly polychlorinated bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenyl</span></strong> (PCB)–contaminated mammals in the world, raising concern about the health consequences of current PCB exposures. Using an individual-based model framework and globally available data on PCB concentrations in killer whale tissues, we show that PCB-mediated effects on reproduction and immune function threaten the long-term viability of >50% of the world’s killer whale populations. PCB-mediated effects over the coming 100 years predicted that killer whale populations near industrialized regions, and those feeding at high trophic levels regardless of location, are at high risk of population collapse. Despite a near-global ban of PCBs more than 30 years ago, the world’s killer whales illustrate the troubling persistence of this chemical class.</p>

High-performance perovskite/Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> monolithic tandem solar cells
<p>The combination of hybrid perovskite and Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> (CIGS) has the potential for realizing high-efficiency thin-film tandem solar cells because of the complementary tunable bandgaps and excellent photovoltaic properties of these materials. In tandem solar device architectures, the interconnecting layer plays a critical role in determining the overall cell performance, requiring both an effective electrical connection and high optical transparency. We used nanoscale interface engineering of the CIGS surface and a heavily doped poly[bis(4-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenyl</span></strong>)(2,4,6-trimethyl<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenyl</span></strong>)amine] (PTAA) hole transport layer between the subcells that preserves open-circuit voltage and enhances both the fill factor and short-circuit current. A monolithic perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cell achieved a 22.43% efficiency, and unencapsulated devices under ambient conditions maintained 88% of their initial efficiency after 500 hours of aging under continuous 1-sun illumination.</p>

Arylation of hydrocarbons enabled by organosilicon reagents and weakly coordinating anions
<p>Over the past 80 years, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenyl</span></strong> cation intermediates have been implicated in a variety of C–H arylation reactions. Although these examples have inspired several theoretical and mechanistic studies, aryl cation equivalents have received limited attention in organic methodology. Their high-energy, promiscuous reactivity profiles have hampered applications in selective intermolecular processes. We report a reaction design that overcomes these challenges. Specifically, we found that β-silicon–stabilized aryl cation equivalents, generated via silylium-mediated fluoride activation, undergo insertion into sp<sup>3</sup> and sp<sup>2</sup> C–H bonds. This reaction manifold provides a framework for the catalytic arylation of hydrocarbons, including simple alkanes such as methane. This process uses low loadings of Earth-abundant initiators (1 to 5 mole percent) and occurs under mild conditions (30° to 100°C).</p>

<i>S5H/DMR6</i> Encodes a Salicylic Acid 5-Hydroxylase That Fine-Tunes Salicylic Acid Homeostasis
<p>The phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) plays essential roles in biotic and abiotic responses, plant development, and leaf senescence. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA or gentisic acid) is one of the most commonly occurring aromatic acids in green plants and is assumed to be generated from SA, but the enzymes involved in its production remain obscure. DMR6 (Downy Mildew Resistant6; At5g24530) has been proven essential in plant immunity of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but its biochemical properties are not well understood. Here, we report the discovery and functional characterization of DMR6 as a salicylic acid 5-hydroxylase (S5H) that catalyzes the formation of 2,5-DHBA by hydroxylating SA at the C5 position of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenyl</span></strong> ring in Arabidopsis. S5H/DMR6 specifically converts SA to 2,5-DHBA in vitro and displays higher catalytic efficiency (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 4.96 × 10<sup>4</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) than the previously reported S3H (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 6.09 × 10<sup>3</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) for SA. Interestingly, S5H/DMR6 displays a substrate inhibition property that may enable automatic control of its enzyme activities. The <i>s5h</i> mutant and <i>s5hs3h</i> double mutant overaccumulate SA and display phenotypes such as a smaller growth size, early senescence, and a loss of susceptibility to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. <i>S5H</i>/<i>DMR6</i> is sensitively induced by SA/pathogen treatment and is expressed widely from young seedlings to senescing plants, whereas <i>S3H</i> is more specifically expressed at the mature and senescing stages. Collectively, our results disclose the identity of the enzyme required for 2,5-DHBA formation and reveal a mechanism by which plants fine-tune SA homeostasis by mediating SA 5-hydroxylation.</p>

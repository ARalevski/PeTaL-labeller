Gene expression profiles of brain endothelial cells during embryonic development at bulk and single-cell levels
<p>The blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> is a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the circulatory system, and it is formed by highly specialized endothelial cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the brain, we generated high-resolution gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic brain endothelial cells using translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the brain vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and analyzed the vascular translatomes of the brain at different time points during embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>, we also compared the brain endothelial translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional cofactor β-catenin (<i>Ctnnb1</i>). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes during the embryonic development of the brain endothelium. We identified genes encoding brain endothelium–specific transcription factors (<i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxl2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, <i>Zfp551</i>, and <i>Zic3</i>) that are associated with maturation of the blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> and act downstream of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway. Profiling of individual brain endothelial cells revealed substantial heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance of <i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, or <i>Zic3</i> transcripts correlated with the increased expression of genes encoding markers of brain endothelial cell differentiation. Expression of <i>Foxf2</i> and <i>Zic3</i> in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced the production of blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> differentiation markers. This comprehensive data set may help to improve the engineering of in vitro blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> models.</p>

Hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier dysfunction and risk for enteric infection
<p>Obesity, diabetes, and related manifestations are associated with an enhanced, but poorly understood, risk for mucosal infection and systemic inflammation. Here, we show in mouse models of obesity and diabetes that hyperglycemia drives intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> permeability, through GLUT2-dependent transcriptional reprogramming of intestinal epithelial cells and alteration of tight and adherence junction integrity. Consequently, hyperglycemia-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> disruption leads to systemic influx of microbial products and enhanced dissemination of enteric infection. Treatment of hyperglycemia, intestinal epithelial–specific GLUT2 deletion, or inhibition of glucose metabolism restores <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> function and bacterial containment. In humans, systemic influx of intestinal microbiome products correlates with individualized glycemic control, indicated by glycated hemoglobin levels. Together, our results mechanistically link hyperglycemia and intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> function with systemic infectious and inflammatory consequences of obesity and diabetes.</p>

Structural insight into nucleosome transcription by RNA polymerase II with elongation factors
<p>RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribes chromosomal DNA that contains multiple nucleosomes. The nucleosome forms transcriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>s, and nucleosomal transcription requires several additional factors in vivo. We demonstrate that the transcription elongation factors Elf1 and Spt4/5 cooperatively lower the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>s and increase the RNAPII processivity in the nucleosome. The cryo–electron microscopy structures of the nucleosome-transcribing RNAPII elongation complexes (ECs) reveal that Elf1 and Spt4/5 reshape the EC downstream edge and intervene between RNAPII and the nucleosome. They facilitate RNAPII progression through superhelical location SHL(–1) by adjusting the nucleosome in favor of the forward progression. They suppress pausing at SHL(–5) by preventing the stable RNAPII-nucleosome interaction. Thus, the EC overcomes the nucleosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>s while providing a platform for various chromatin functions.</p>

Sources of human viruses
<p>Most emerging infectious diseases are caused by RNA viruses (<i>1</i>). Many of these that are newly found in humans have a natural mammal or bird <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reservoir</span></strong>; some are transmitted by arthropod vectors, such as mosquitos (<i>2</i>). If we do not know the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reservoir</span></strong> host and/or vector, it is harder to identify individuals and populations at greatest risk of infection and to design an effective public health response.

Massive blow-out craters formed by hydrate-controlled methane expulsion from the Arctic seafloor
<p>Widespread methane release from thawing Arctic gas hydrates is a major concern, yet the processes, sources, and fluxes involved remain unconstrained. We present geophysical data documenting a cluster of kilometer-wide craters and mounds from the Barents Sea floor associated with large-scale methane expulsion. Combined with ice sheet/gas hydrate modeling, our results indicate that during glaciation, natural gas migrated from underlying hydrocarbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reservoir</span></strong>s and was sequestered extensively as subglacial gas hydrates. Upon ice sheet retreat, methane from this hydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reservoir</span></strong> concentrated in massive mounds before being abruptly released to form craters. We propose that these processes were likely widespread across past glaciated petroleum provinces and that they also provide an analog for the potential future destabilization of subglacial gas hydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reservoir</span></strong>s beneath contemporary ice sheets.</p>

YAP-mediated mechanotransduction determines the podocyte’s response to damage
<p>Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells of the kidney filtration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>. They are subjected to physiological filtration pressure and considerable mechanical strain, which can be further increased in various kidney diseases. When injury causes cytoskeletal reorganization and morphological alterations of these cells, the filtration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> may become compromised and allow proteins to leak into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Using time-resolved proteomics, we showed that podocyte injury stimulated the activity of the transcriptional coactivator YAP and the expression of YAP target genes in a rat model of glomerular disease before the development of proteinuria. Although the activities of YAP and its ortholog TAZ are activated by mechanical stress in most cell types, injury reduced YAP and TAZ activity in cultured human and mouse podocyte cell lines grown on stiff substrates. Culturing these cells on soft matrix or inhibiting stress fiber formation recapitulated the damage-induced YAP up-regulation observed in vivo, indicating a mechanotransduction-dependent mechanism of YAP activation in podocytes. YAP overexpression in cultured podocytes increased the abundance of extracellular matrix–related proteins that can contribute to fibrosis. YAP activity was increased in mouse models of diabetic nephropathy, and the YAP target <i>CTGF</i> was highly expressed in renal biopsies from glomerular disease patients. Although overexpression of human YAP in mice induced mild proteinuria, pharmacological inhibition of the interaction between YAP and its partner TEAD in rats ameliorated glomerular disease and reduced damage-induced mechanosignaling in the glomeruli. Thus, perturbation of YAP-dependent mechanosignaling is a potential therapeutic target for treating some glomerular diseases.</p>

PDZRN3 destabilizes endothelial cell-cell junctions through a PKCζ-containing polarity complex to increase vascular permeability
<p>Endothelial cells serve as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> between blood and tissues. Maintenance of the endothelial cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> depends on the integrity of intercellular junctions, which is regulated by a polarity complex that includes the ζ isoform of atypical protein kinase C (PKCζ) and partitioning defective 3 (PAR3). We revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase PDZ domain–containing ring finger 3 (PDZRN3) regulated endothelial intercellular junction integrity. Endothelial cell–specific overexpression of <i>Pdzrn3</i> led to early embryonic lethality with severe hemorrhaging and altered organization of endothelial intercellular junctions. Conversely, endothelial-specific loss of <i>Pdzrn3</i> prevented vascular leakage in a mouse model of transient ischemic stroke, an effect that was mimicked by pharmacological inhibition of PKCζ. PDZRN3 regulated Wnt signaling and associated with a complex containing PAR3, PKCζ, and the multi-PDZ domain protein MUPP1 (Discs Lost–multi-PDZ domain protein 1) and targeted MUPP1 for proteasomal degradation in transfected cells. Transient ischemic stroke increased the ubiquitination of MUPP1, and deficiency of MUPP1 in endothelial cells was associated with decreased localization of PKCζ and PAR3 at intercellular junctions. In endothelial cells, <i>Pdzrn3</i> overexpression increased permeability through a PKCζ-dependent pathway. In contrast, <i>Pdzrn3</i> depletion enhanced PKCζ accumulation at cell-cell contacts and reinforced the cortical actin cytoskeleton under stress conditions. These findings reveal how PDZRN3 regulates vascular permeability through a PKCζ-containing complex.</p>

Predicting reservoir hosts and arthropod vectors from evolutionary signatures in RNA virus genomes

Quantifying hot carrier and thermal contributions in plasmonic photocatalysis

Endothelial Dab1 signaling orchestrates neuro-glia-vessel communication in the central nervous system
<p>The architecture of the neurovascular unit (NVU) is controlled by the communication of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. We found that the neuronal guidance cue reelin possesses proangiogenic activities that ensure the communication of endothelial cells (ECs) with the glia to control neuronal migration and the establishment of the blood-brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> in the mouse brain. Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and Disabled1 (Dab1) expressed in ECs are required for vascularization of the retina and the cerebral cortex. Deletion of Dab1 in ECs leads to a reduced secretion of laminin-α4 and decreased activation of integrin-β1 in glial cells, which in turn control neuronal migration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> properties of the NVU. Thus, reelin signaling in the endothelium is an instructive and integrative cue essential for neuro-glia-vascular communication.</p>

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures

<i>C1orf106</i> is a colitis risk gene that regulates stability of epithelial adherens junctions
<p>Polymorphisms in <i>C1orf106</i> are associated with increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the function of C1orf106 and the consequences of disease-associated polymorphisms are unknown. Here we demonstrate that C1orf106 regulates adherens junction stability by regulating the degradation of cytohesin-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that controls activation of ARF6. By limiting cytohesin-1–dependent ARF6 activation, C1orf106 stabilizes adherens junctions. Consistent with this model, <i>C1orf106</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice exhibit defects in the intestinal epithelial cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>, a phenotype observed in IBD patients that confers increased susceptibility to intestinal pathogens. Furthermore, the IBD risk variant increases C1orf106 ubiquitination and turnover with consequent functional impairments.

Root diffusion barrier control by a vasculature-derived peptide binding to the SGN3 receptor
<p>The root endodermis forms its extracellular diffusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> by developing ringlike impregnations called Casparian strips. A factor responsible for their establishment is the SCHENGEN3/GASSHO1 (SGN3/GSO1) receptor-like kinase. Its loss of function causes discontinuous Casparian strips. SGN3 also mediates endodermal overlignification of other Casparian strip mutants. Yet, without ligand, SGN3 function remained elusive. Here we report that <i>schengen2 (sgn2)</i> is defective in an enzyme sulfating peptide ligands. On the basis of this observation, we identified two stele-expressed peptides (CASPARIAN STRIP INTEGRITY FACTORS, CIF1/2) that complement <i>sgn2</i> at nanomolar concentrations and induce Casparian strip mislocalization as well as overlignification—all of which depend on SGN3. Direct peptide binding to recombinant SGN3 identifies these peptides as SGN3 ligands. We speculate that CIF1/2-SGN3 is part of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> surveillance system, evolved to guarantee effective sealing of the supracellular Casparian strip network.</p>

Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century
<p>Soil is the largest terrestrial carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reservoir</span></strong> and may influence the sign and magnitude of carbon cycle–climate feedbacks.

Consequently, ESMs overestimated the carbon sequestration potential of soils by a factor of nearly two (40 ± 27%).

Vascular CXCR4 Limits Atherosclerosis by Maintaining Arterial Integrity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine ligand/receptor axis controls (progenitor) cell homeostasis and trafficking. So far, an atheroprotective role of CXCL12/CXCR4 has only been implied through pharmacological intervention, in particular, because the somatic deletion of the <i>CXCR4</i> gene in mice is embryonically lethal. Moreover, cell-specific effects of CXCR4 in the arterial wall and underlying mechanisms remain elusive, prompting us to investigate the relevance of CXCR4 in vascular cell types for atheroprotection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined the role of vascular CXCR4 in atherosclerosis and plaque composition by inducing an endothelial cell (BmxCreER<sup>T2</sup>-driven)–specific or smooth muscle cell (SMC, SmmhcCreER<sup>T2</sup>- or TaglnCre-driven)–specific deficiency of <i>CXCR4</i> in an apolipoprotein E–deficient mouse model. To identify underlying mechanisms for effects of CXCR4, we studied endothelial permeability, intravital leukocyte adhesion, involvement of the Akt/WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and relevant phosphatases in VE-cadherin expression and function, vascular tone in aortic rings, cholesterol efflux from macrophages, and expression of SMC phenotypic markers. Finally, we analyzed associations of common genetic variants at the <i>CXCR4</i> locus with the risk for coronary heart disease, along with <i>CXCR4</i> transcript expression in human atherosclerotic plaques.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cell-specific deletion of <i>CXCR4</i> in arterial endothelial cells (n=12–15) or SMCs (n=13–24) markedly increased atherosclerotic lesion formation in hyperlipidemic mice. Endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> function was promoted by CXCL12/CXCR4, which triggered Akt/WNT/β-catenin signaling to drive VE-cadherin expression and stabilized junctional VE-cadherin complexes through associated phosphatases. Conversely, endothelial <i>CXCR4</i> deficiency caused arterial leakage and inflammatory leukocyte recruitment during atherogenesis. In arterial SMCs, CXCR4 sustained normal vascular reactivity and contractile responses, whereas <i>CXCR4</i> deficiency favored a synthetic phenotype, the occurrence of macrophage-like SMCs in the lesions, and impaired cholesterol efflux. Regression analyses in humans (n=259 796) identified the C-allele at <i>rs2322864</i> within the <i>CXCR4</i> locus to be associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease. In line, C/C risk genotype carriers showed reduced CXCR4 expression in carotid artery plaques (n=188), which was furthermore associated with symptomatic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data clearly establish that vascular CXCR4 limits atherosclerosis by maintaining arterial integrity, preserving endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> function, and a normal contractile SMC phenotype. Enhancing these beneficial functions of arterial CXCR4 by selective modulators might open novel therapeutic options in atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Red squirrels in the British Isles are infected with leprosy bacilli
<p>Leprosy, caused by infection with <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i> or the recently discovered <i>Mycobacterium lepromatosis</i>, was once endemic in humans in the British Isles. Red squirrels in Great Britain (<i>Sciurus vulgaris</i>) have increasingly been observed with leprosy-like lesions on the head and limbs. Using genomics, histopathology, and serology, we found <i>M. lepromatosis</i> in squirrels from England, Ireland, and Scotland, and <i>M. leprae</i> in squirrels from Brownsea Island, England. Infection was detected in overtly diseased and seemingly healthy animals. Phylogenetic comparisons of British and Irish <i>M. lepromatosis</i> with two Mexican strains from humans show that they diverged from a common ancestor around 27,000 years ago, whereas the <i>M. leprae</i> strain is closest to one that circulated in Medieval England.

Leprosy in red squirrels
<p>In 1873, the Norwegian doctor Armauer Hansen helped to lay the foundations of modern microbiology when he discovered that leprosy was an infectious disease, not an inherited condition. However, his attempts to cultivate the rod-shaped bacilli that he had observed in microscopic studies of tissues from leprosy patients were unsuccessful, emphasizing the unique growth requirements of these bacilli. Even today, <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i>, the causative organism of leprosy, cannot be grown on culture media, and many questions remain about its mode of transmission and epidemiology (<i>1</i>). The unexpected identification of red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) as an extant animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reservoir</span></strong> of leprosy bacilli by Avanzi <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) on page 744 of this issue elucidates the host conditions that may allow leprosy bacilli to multiply and cause disease.</p>

Dissolved organic sulfur in the ocean: Biogeochemistry of a petagram inventory
<p>Although sulfur is an essential element for marine primary production and critical for climate processes, little is known about the oceanic pool of nonvolatile dissolved organic sulfur (DOS). We present a basin-scale distribution of solid-phase extractable DOS in the East Atlantic Ocean and the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Although molar DOS versus dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) ratios of 0.11 ± 0.024 in Atlantic surface water resembled phytoplankton stoichiometry (sulfur/nitrogen ~ 0.08), increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) versus DOS ratios and decreasing methionine-S yield demonstrated selective DOS removal and active involvement in marine biogeochemical cycles. Based on stoichiometric estimates, the minimum global inventory of marine DOS is 6.7 petagrams of sulfur, exceeding all other marine organic sulfur <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reservoir</span></strong>s by an order of magnitude.</p>

Subthreshold Schottky-barrier thin-film transistors with ultralow power and high intrinsic gain
<p>The quest for low power becomes highly compelling in newly emerging application areas related to wearable devices in the Internet of Things. Here, we report on a Schottky-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> indium-gallium-zinc-oxide thin-film transistor operating in the deep subthreshold regime (i.e., near the OFF state) at low supply voltages (<1 volt) and ultralow power (<1 nanowatt). By using a Schottky-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> at the source and drain contacts, the current-voltage characteristics of the transistor were virtually channel-length independent with an infinite output resistance. It exhibited high intrinsic gain (>400) that was both bias and geometry independent. The transistor reported here is useful for sensor interface circuits in wearable devices where high current sensitivity and ultralow power are vital for battery-less operation.</p>

Improving efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells with photocurable fluoropolymers
<p>Organometal halide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated high conversion efficiency but poor long-term stability against ultraviolet irradiation and water.

The luminescent photopolymers re-emit ultraviolet light in the visible range, boosting perovskite solar cells efficiency to nearly 19% under standard illumination.

Replication of human noroviruses in stem cell–derived human enteroids
<p>The major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> to research and development of effective interventions for human noroviruses (HuNoVs) has been the lack of a robust and reproducible in vitro cultivation system. HuNoVs are the leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. We report the successful cultivation of multiple HuNoV strains in enterocytes in stem cell–derived, nontransformed human intestinal enteroid monolayer cultures. Bile, a critical factor of the intestinal milieu, is required for strain-dependent HuNoV replication. Lack of appropriate histoblood group antigen expression in intestinal cells restricts virus replication, and infectivity is abrogated by inactivation (e.g., irradiation, heating) and serum neutralization. This culture system recapitulates the human intestinal epithelium, permits human host-pathogen studies of previously noncultivatable pathogens, and allows the assessment of methods to prevent and treat HuNoV infections.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)
<sec><title>Vibrating Water Apart</title><p>The main route for producing hydrogen for industrial chemical synthesis is steam reforming, in which water and methane react at high temperatures on nickel catalysts to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide. For both water and methane, the initial dissociation step can be promoted by the translational energy of a molecule as well as its internal vibrational energy, and fundamental studies of these reactions try to determine the relative contributions of these pathways.

Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The porosity of wood cell walls is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood materials perspective. The movement of water in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous networks formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and open conduits created by vessels and perforation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, water can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and fiber cell walls; however, these micropore networks are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the distribution of micropores in the secondary walls and middle lamellae of tracheids and fibers in relation to cell wall composition. Using two different types of probe, we identified a greater porosity of secondary cell walls and a reduced porosity of the middle lamella. Areas of reduced porosity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell wall of both tracheids and fibers that appear unrelated to lignification or the distribution of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood fiber cell walls were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to porosity probes. Vessel cell walls were comparable to those of fibers in terms of both porosity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell wall porosity in xylem. The highly lignified middle lamella, and lumen surface, act as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> to probe movement and, therefore, water movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

Development Defects of Hydroxy-Fatty Acid-Accumulating Seeds Are Reduced by Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Researchers have long endeavored to produce modified fatty acids in easily managed crop plants where they are not natively found. An important step toward this goal has been the biosynthesis of these valuable products in model oilseeds. The successful production of such fatty acids has revealed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>s to the broad application of this technology, including low seed oil and low proportion of the introduced fatty acid and reduced seed vigor. Here, we analyze the impact of producing hydroxy-fatty acids on seedling development. We show that germinating seeds of a hydroxy-fatty acid-accumulating Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) line produce chlorotic cotyledons and suffer reduced photosynthetic capacity. These seedlings retain hydroxy-fatty acids in polar lipids, including chloroplast lipids, and exhibit decreased fatty acid synthesis. Triacylglycerol mobilization in seedling development also is reduced, especially for lipids that include hydroxy-fatty acid moieties. These developmental defects are ameliorated by increased flux of hydroxy-fatty acids into seed triacylglycerol created through the expression of either castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) acyltransferase enzyme ACYL-COA:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE2 or PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1A. Such expression increases both the level of total stored triacylglycerol and the rate at which it is mobilized, fueling fatty acid synthesis and restoring photosynthetic capacity. Our results suggest that further improvements in seedling development may require the specific mobilization of triacylglycerol-containing hydroxy-fatty acids. Understanding the defects in early development caused by the accumulation of modified fatty acids and providing mechanisms to circumvent these defects are vital steps in the development of tailored oil crops.</p>

A Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitor Enhances Resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> Wilt
<p>Pectins are major components of the primary plant cell wall, which functions as the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> against pathogens. Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) catalyze the demethylesterification of the homogalacturonan domains of pectin in the plant cell wall. Their activity is regulated by PME inhibitors (PMEIs). Here, we provide evidence that the pectin methylesterase-inhibiting protein GhPMEI3 from cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) functions in plant responses to infection by the fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>. GhPMEI3 interacts with PMEs and regulates the expression of a specific fungal polygalacturonase (VdPG1). Ectopic expression of GhPMEI3 increased pectin methyl esterification and limited fungal disease in cotton, while also modulating root elongation. Enzymatic analyses revealed that GhPMEI3 efficiently inhibited the activity of cotton GhPME2/GhPME31. Experiments using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants expressing the <i>GhPMEI3</i> gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter revealed that GhPMEI3 inhibits the endogenous PME activity in vitro. Moreover, the enhanced resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> was associated with altered <i>VdPG1</i> expression. Virus-induced silencing of <i>GhPMEI3</i> resulted in increased susceptibility to <i>V. dahliae</i>. Further, we investigated the interaction between GhPMEI3 and GhPME2/GhPME31 using inhibition assays and molecular docking simulations. The peculiar structural features of GhPMEI3 were responsible for the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with GhPME2/GhPME31. Together, these results suggest that GhPMEI3 enhances resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt. Moreover, GhPMEI3-GhPMEs interactions would be needed before drawing the correlation between structure-function and are crucial for plant development against the ever-evolving fungal pathogens.</p>

Turnip Mosaic Virus Counteracts Selective Autophagy of the Viral Silencing Suppressor HCpro<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway and has emerged as a key mechanism of antiviral immunity in metazoans, including the selective elimination of viral components. In turn, some animal viruses are able to escape and modulate autophagy for enhanced pathogenicity. Whether host autophagic responses and viral countermeasures play similar roles in plant-virus interactions is not well understood. Here, we have identified selective autophagy as antiviral pathway during plant infection with turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), a positive-stranded RNA potyvirus. We show that the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 suppresses viral accumulation by targeting the viral RNA silencing suppressor helper-component proteinase (HCpro), presumably in association with virus-induced RNA granules. Intriguingly, TuMV seems to antagonize NBR1-dependent autophagy during infection by the activity of distinct viral proteins, thereby limiting its antiviral capacity. We also found that NBR1-independent bulk autophagy prevents premature plant death, thus extending the lifespan of virus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reservoir</span></strong>s and particle production. Together, our study highlights a conserved role of selective autophagy in antiviral immunity and suggests the evolvement of viral protein functions to inhibit autophagy processes, despite a potential trade-off in host survival.</p>

Identification and Metabolite Profiling of Chemical Activators of Lipid Accumulation in Green Algae
<p>Microalgae are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing biofuels and coproducts. However, several limitations must be overcome before algae-based production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce lipid accumulation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>, a chemical genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 compounds were screened against <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, and 243 compounds were identified that increase triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation without terminating growth. Identified compounds were classified by structural similarity, and 15 were selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth fitness, photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch concentrations. TAG accumulation was verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification of total fatty acids, and targeted TAG and galactolipid measurements were performed using liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry. These results demonstrated that TAG accumulation does not necessarily proceed at the expense of galactolipid. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into pathway shifts due to five different compound treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic stresses commonly used to induce oil accumulation in algae. The efficacy of these compounds also was demonstrated in three other algal species. These lipid-inducing compounds offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the biochemical mechanisms of lipid accumulation in algae and a direct means to improve algal oil content independent of the severe growth limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying postzygotic reproductive isolation. A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete fertility of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing fertile gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing fertile gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of biological processes underlying reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>s.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The adhesion of plant cells is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between cell wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant cells are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border cells are examples of this. Border cells (in some species known as border-like cells) provide an expendable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized cell separation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex cellular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip cell walls. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of cell wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of cell wall components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified multiple novel modes of cell wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border cells. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border cell maturation and enable us to develop a model of the separation process. We propose that loss of adhesion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of cell curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

A <i>β</i>-Ketoacyl-CoA Synthase Is Involved in Rice Leaf Cuticular Wax Synthesis and Requires a CER2-LIKE Protein as a Cofactor
<p>Cuticular waxes are complex mixtures of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, forming a natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> on aerial surfaces of terrestrial plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. In VLCFA biosynthesis, β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) is the key enzyme, catalyzing the first reaction in fatty acid elongation and determining substrate specificity. We isolated a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>wax crystal-sparse leaf 4</i> (<i>WSL4</i>) gene using a map-based cloning strategy. <i>WSL4</i> is predicted to encode a KCS, a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CER6. Complementation of the mutant <i>wsl4-1</i> with <i>WSL4</i> genomic DNA rescued the cuticular wax-deficient phenotype, confirming the function of <i>WSL4</i>. The load of wax components longer than 30 carbons (C30) and C28 were reduced markedly in <i>wsl4-1</i> and <i>wsl4-2</i> mutants, respectively. Overexpression of <i>WSL4</i> increased the cuticular wax load in rice leaves. We further isolated a cofactor of WSL4, OsCER2, a homolog of Arabidopsis CER2, by coimmunoprecipitation and confirmed their physical interaction by split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid experiments. Expression of <i>WSL4</i> alone in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells resulted in increased C24 but did not produce VLCFAs of greater length, whereas expressing <i>OsCER2</i> alone showed no effect. Coexpression of <i>WSL4</i> and <i>OsCER2</i> in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells yielded fatty acids up to C30. OsCER2 with a mutated HxxxD motif (H172E, D176A, and D176H) interrupted its interaction with WSL4 and failed to elongate VLCFAs past C24 when expressed with WSL4 in <i>elo3</i> yeast cells. These results demonstrated that WSL4 was involved in VLCFA elongation beyond C22 and that elongation beyond C24 required the participation of OsCER2.</p>

IRREGULAR POLLEN EXINE1 Is a Novel Factor in Anther Cuticle and Pollen Exine Formation
<p>Anther cuticle and pollen exine are protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>s for pollen development and fertilization. Despite that several regulators have been identified for anther cuticle and pollen exine development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), few genes have been characterized in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report a novel male-sterile mutant in maize, <i>irregular pollen exine1</i> (<i>ipe1</i>), which exhibited a glossy outer anther surface, abnormal Ubisch bodies, and defective pollen exine. Using map-based cloning, the <i>IPE1</i> gene was isolated as a putative glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. Transcripts of <i>IPE1</i> were preferentially accumulated in the tapetum during the tetrad and early uninucleate microspore stage. A biochemical assay indicated that <i>ipe1</i> anthers had altered constituents of wax and a significant reduction of cutin monomers and fatty acids. RNA sequencing data revealed that genes implicated in wax and flavonoid metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and elongation were differentially expressed in <i>ipe1</i> mutant anthers. In addition, the analysis of transfer DNA insertional lines of the orthologous gene in Arabidopsis suggested that IPE1 and their orthologs have a partially conserved function in male organ development. Our results showed that IPE1 participates in the putative oxidative pathway of C16/C18 ω-hydroxy fatty acids and controls anther cuticle and pollen exine development together with MALE STERILITY26 and MALE STERILITY45 in maize.</p>

A Framework for Lateral Membrane Trafficking and Polar Tethering of the PEN3 ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter
<p>The outermost cell layer of plants, the epidermis, and its outer (lateral) membrane domain facing the environment are continuously challenged by biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, the epidermis and the outer membrane domain provide important selective and protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>s. However, only a small number of specifically outer membrane-localized proteins are known. Similarly, molecular mechanisms underlying the trafficking and the polar placement of outer membrane domain proteins require further exploration. Here, we demonstrate that ACTIN7 (ACT7) mediates trafficking of the PENETRATION3 (PEN3) outer membrane protein from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane in the root epidermis of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and that actin function contributes to PEN3 endocytic recycling. In contrast to such generic ACT7-dependent trafficking from the TGN, the EXOCYST84b (EXO84b) tethering factor mediates PEN3 outer-membrane polarity. Moreover, precise EXO84b placement at the outer membrane domain itself requires ACT7 function. Hence, our results uncover spatially and mechanistically distinct requirements for ACT7 function during outer lateral membrane cargo trafficking and polarity establishment. They further identify an exocyst tethering complex mediator of outer lateral membrane cargo polarity.</p>

The Evolution of Innate Immune Genes: Purifying and Balancing Selection on β-Defensins in Waterfowl
<p>In disease dynamics, high immune gene diversity can confer a selective advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for genes involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector genes involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector genes; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five β-defensin genes were characterized in mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) and other waterfowl; key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reservoir</span></strong> species for many zoonotic diseases. All five genes showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific β-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being fixed across all species investigated. Purifying selection to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these genes in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for balancing selection acting on the most recently duplicated β-defensin gene (<i>AvBD3b</i>). For this gene, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of β-defensin genes allows exploration of wider functional space. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian β-defensin effector molecules, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune genes, such as receptor and signalling molecules, where balancing selection to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.</p>

Claudin-6, -10d and -10e contribute to seawater acclimation in the euryhaline puffer fish <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i>
<p>Expression profiles of <i>claudin-6, -10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> in the euryhaline teleost fish <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i> revealed <i>claudin-6</i> in brain, eye, gill and skin tissue, while <i>claudin-10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> were found in brain, gill and skin only. In fishes, the gill and skin are important tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong>s that interface directly with surrounding water, but these organs generally function differently in osmoregulation. Therefore, roles for gill and skin claudin-6, -10d and -10e in the osmoregulatory strategies of <i>T. nigroviridis</i> were investigated. In the gill epithelium, claudin-6, -10d and -10e co-localized with Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase immunoreactive (NKA-ir) ionocytes, and differences in sub-cellular localization could be observed in hypoosmotic (freshwater, FW) versus hyperosmotic (seawater, SW) environments. Claudin-10d and -10e abundance increased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW versus FW, while claudin-6 abundance decreased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW. Taken together with our knowledge of claudin-6 and -10 function in other vertebrates, data support the idea that in SW-acclimated <i>T. nigroviridis</i>, these claudins are abundant in gill ionocytes, where they contribute to the formation of a Na<sup>+</sup> shunt and ‘leaky’ epithelium, both of which are characteristic of salt-secreting SW fish gills. Skin claudin-10d and -10e abundance also increased in fish acclimated to SW versus those in FW, but so did claudin-6. In skin, claudin-6 was found to co-localize with NKA-ir cells, but claudin-10d and -10e did not. This study provides direct evidence that the gill epithelium contains salinity-responsive tight junction proteins that are abundant primarily in ionocytes. These same proteins also appear to play a role in the osmoregulatory physiology of the epidermis.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barrier</span></strong> properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

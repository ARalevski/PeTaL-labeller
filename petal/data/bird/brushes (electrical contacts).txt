Multivalent counterions diminish the lubricity of polyelectrolyte brushes
<p>Polyelectrolyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brush</span></strong>es provide wear protection and lubrication in many technical, medical, physiological, and biological applications. Wear resistance and low friction are attributed to counterion osmotic pressure and the hydration layer surrounding the charged polymer segments. However, the presence of multivalent counterions in solution can strongly affect the interchain interactions and structural properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brush</span></strong> layers. We evaluated the lubrication properties of polystyrene sulfonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brush</span></strong> layers sliding against each other in aqueous solutions containing increasing concentrations of counterions. The presence of multivalent ions (Y<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ba<sup>2+</sup>), even at minute concentrations, markedly increases the friction forces between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brush</span></strong> layers owing to electrostatic bridging and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brush</span></strong> collapse. Our results suggest that the lubricating properties of polyelectrolyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brush</span></strong>es in multivalent solution are hindered relative to those in monovalent solution.</p>

A <i>LIMA1</i> variant promotes low plasma LDL cholesterol and decreases intestinal cholesterol absorption
<p>A high concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although LDL-C levels vary among humans and are heritable, the genetic factors affecting LDL-C are not fully characterized. We identified a rare frameshift variant in the <i>LIMA1</i> (also known as <i>EPLIN</i> or <i>SREBP3</i>) gene from a Chinese family of Kazakh ethnicity with inherited low LDL-C and reduced cholesterol absorption. In a mouse model, LIMA1 was mainly expressed in the small intestine and localized on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">brush</span></strong> border membrane. LIMA1 bridged NPC1L1, an essential protein for cholesterol absorption, to a transportation complex containing myosin Vb and facilitated cholesterol uptake. Similar to the human phenotype, <i>Lima1</i>-deficient mice displayed reduced cholesterol absorption and were resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Through our study of both mice and humans, we identify LIMA1 as a key protein regulating intestinal cholesterol absorption.</p>

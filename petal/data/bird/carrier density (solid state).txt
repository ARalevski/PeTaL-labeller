Screening in crystalline liquids protects energetic carriers in hybrid perovskites
<p>Hybrid lead halide perovskites exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> properties that resemble those of pristine nonpolar semiconductors despite static and dynamic disorder, but how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s are protected from efficient scattering with charged defects and optical phonons is unknown. Here, we reveal the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> protection mechanism by comparing three single-crystal lead bromide perovskites: CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>, CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>, and CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>. We observed hot fluorescence emission from energetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s with ~10<sup>2</sup>-picosecond lifetimes in CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub> or CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>, but not in CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>. The hot fluorescence is correlated with liquid-like molecular reorientational motions, suggesting that dynamic screening protects energetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s via solvation or large polaron formation on time scales competitive with that of ultrafast cooling. Similar protections likely exist for band-edge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s. The long-lived energetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s may enable hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> solar cells with efficiencies exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit.</p>

Opposing microtubule motors control motility, morphology and cargo segregation during ER-to-Golgi transport
<p>We recently demonstrated that dynein and kinesin motors drive multiple aspects of endosomal function in mammalian cells. These functions include driving motility, maintaining morphology (notably through providing longitudinal tension to support vesicle fission), and driving cargo sorting. Microtubule motors drive bidirectional motility during traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. Here, we have examined the role of microtubule motors in transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> motility, morphology, and domain organization during ER-to-Golgi transport. We show that, consistent with our findings for endosomal dynamics, microtubule motor function during ER-to-Golgi transport of secretory cargo is required for motility, morphology, and cargo sorting within vesicular tubular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s <i>en route</i> to the Golgi. Our data are consistent with previous findings that defined roles for dynein-1, kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-2 in this trafficking step. Our high resolution tracking data identify some intriguing aspects. Depletion of kinesin-1 reduces the number of motile structures seen, which is in line with other findings relating to the role of kinesin-1 in ER export. However, those transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s that were produced had a much greater run length suggesting that this motor can act as a brake on anterograde motility. Kinesin-2 depletion did not significantly reduce the number of motile transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s but did cause a similar increase in run length. These data suggest that kinesins act as negative regulators of ER-to-Golgi transport. Depletion of dynein not only reduced the number of motile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s formed but also caused tubulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s similar to that seen for sorting nexin-coated early endosomes. Our data indicated that the previously observed anterograde–retrograde polarity of transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s in transit to the Golgi from the ER is maintained by microtubule motor function.</p>

Long-range hot-carrier transport in hybrid perovskites visualized by ultrafast microscopy
<p>The Shockley-Queisser limit for solar cell efficiency can be overcome if hot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s can be harvested before they thermalize. Recently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> cooling time up to 100 picoseconds was observed in hybrid perovskites, but it is unclear whether these long-lived hot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s can migrate long distance for efficient collection. We report direct visualization of hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> migration in methylammonium lead iodide (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>) thin films by ultrafast transient absorption microscopy, demonstrating three distinct transport regimes. Quasiballistic transport was observed to correlate with excess kinetic energy, resulting in up to 230 nanometers transport distance that could overcome grain boundaries. The nonequilibrium transport persisted over tens of picoseconds and ~600 nanometers before reaching the diffusive transport limit. These results suggest potential applications of hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> devices based on hybrid perovskites.</p>

Genetic identification of familial hypercholesterolemia within a single U.S. health care system
<p>Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) remains underdiagnosed despite widespread cholesterol screening. Exome sequencing and electronic health record (EHR) data of 50,726 individuals were used to assess the prevalence and clinical impact of FH-associated genomic variants in the Geisinger Health System. The estimated FH prevalence was 1:256 in unselected participants and 1:118 in participants ascertained via the cardiac catheterization laboratory. FH variant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s had significantly increased risk of coronary artery disease. Only 24% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s met EHR-based presequencing criteria for probable or definite FH diagnosis. Active statin use was identified in 58% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s; 46% of statin-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level below 100 mg/dl. Thus, we find that genomic screening can prompt the diagnosis of FH patients, most of whom are receiving inadequate lipid-lowering therapy.</p>

Three-orders-of-magnitude variation of carrier lifetimes with crystal phase of gold nanoclusters
<p>We report a three-orders-of-magnitude variation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> lifetim</span></strong>es in exotic crystalline phases of gold nanoclusters (NCs) in addition to the well-known face-centered cubic structure, including hexagonal close-packed (hcp) Au<sub>30</sub> and body-centered cubic (bcc) Au<sub>38</sub> NCs protected by the same type of capping ligand. The bcc Au<sub>38</sub> NC had an exceptionally long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> lifetim</span></strong>e (4.7 microseconds) comparable to that of bulk silicon, whereas the hcp Au<sub>30</sub> NC had a very short lifetime (1 nanosecond). Although the presence of ligands may, in general, affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> lifetim</span></strong>es, experimental and theoretical results showed that the drastically different recombination lifetimes originate in the different overlaps of wave functions between the tetrahedral Au<sub>4</sub> building blocks in the hierarchical structures of these NCs.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
RopGEF1 Plays a Critical Role in Polar Auxin Transport in Early Development
<p>Polar auxin transport, facilitated by the combined activities of auxin influx and efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s to maintain asymmetric auxin distribution, is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>RopGEF1</i>, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs), is critically involved in polar distribution of auxin influx <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> AUX1 and differential accumulation of efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s PIN7 and PIN2 and is important for embryo and early seedling development when RopGEF1 is prevalently expressed. Knockdown or knockout of <i>RopGEF1</i> induces embryo defects, cotyledon vein breaks, and delayed root gravity responses. Altered expression from the auxin response reporter <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in the root pole of <i>RopGEF1</i>-deficient embryos and loss of asymmetric distribution of <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in their gravistimulated root tips suggest that auxin distribution is affected in <i>ropgef1</i> mutants. This is reflected by the polarity of AUX1 being altered in <i>ropgef1</i> embryos and roots, shifting from the normal apical membrane location to a basal location in embryo central vascular and root protophloem cells and also reduced PIN7 accumulation at embryos and altered PIN2 distribution in gravistimulated roots of mutant seedlings. In establishing that RopGEF1 is critical for AUX1 localization and PIN differential accumulation, our results reveal a role for RopGEF1 in cell polarity and polar auxin transport whereby it imapcts auxin-mediated plant growth and development.</p>

Novel Desmin Mutation p.Glu401Asp Impairs Filament Formation, Disrupts Cell Membrane Integrity, and Causes Severe Arrhythmogenic Left Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dysplasia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Desmin (<i>DES</i>) mutations cause severe skeletal and cardiac muscle disease with heterogeneous phenotypes. Recently, <i>DES</i> mutations were described in patients with inherited arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia, although their cellular and molecular pathomechanisms are not precisely known. Our aim is to describe clinically and functionally the novel <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp mutation as a cause of inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified the novel <i>DES</i> mutation p.Glu401Asp in a large Spanish family with inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia and a high incidence of adverse cardiac events. A full clinical evaluation was performed on all mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s and non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s to establish clinical and genetic cosegregation. In addition, desmin, and intercalar disc–related proteins expression were histologically analyzed in explanted cardiac tissue affected by the <i>DES</i> mutation. Furthermore, mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and cultured from 2 family members with the <i>DES</i> mutation (1 with mild and 1 with severe symptomatology) and a member without the mutation (control) and differentiated ex vivo to cardiomyocytes. Then, important genes related to cardiac differentiation and function were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Finally, the p.Glu401Asp mutated <i>DES</i> gene was transfected into cell lines and analyzed by confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 66 family members screened for the <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp mutation, 23 of them were positive, 6 were obligate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s, and 2 were likely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s. One hundred percent of genotype-positive patients presented data consistent with inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia phenotype with variable disease severity expression, high-incidence of sudden cardiac death, and absence of skeletal myopathy or conduction system disorders. Immunohistochemistry was compatible with inherited arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia, and the functional study showed an abnormal growth pattern and cellular adhesion, reduced desmin RNA expression, and some other membrane proteins, as well, and desmin aggregates in transfected cells expressing the mutant desmin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <i>DES</i>-p.Glu401Asp mutation causes predominant inherited left ventricular arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy/dysplasia with a high incidence of adverse clinical events in the absence of skeletal myopathy or conduction system disorders.

Homogenized halides and alkali cation segregation in alloyed organic-inorganic perovskites
<p>The role of the alkali metal cations in halide perovskite solar cells is not well understood. Using synchrotron-based nano–x-ray fluorescence and complementary measurements, we found that the halide distribution becomes homogenized upon addition of cesium iodide, either alone or with rubidium iodide, for substoichiometric, stoichiometric, and overstoichiometric preparations, where the lead halide is varied with respect to organic halide precursors. Halide homogenization coincides with long-lived charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> decays, spatially homogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> dynamics (as visualized by ultrafast microscopy), and improved photovoltaic device performance. We found that rubidium and potassium phase-segregate in highly concentrated clusters. Alkali metals are beneficial at low concentrations, where they homogenize the halide distribution, but at higher concentrations, they form recombination-active second-phase clusters.</p>

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices
<p>Cyclotron motion of charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s in metals and semiconductors leads to Landau quantization and magneto-oscillatory behavior in their properties. Cryogenic temperatures are usually required to observe these oscillations. We show that graphene superlattices support a different type of quantum oscillation that does not rely on Landau quantization. The oscillations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s experience effectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Our work hints at unexplored physics in Hofstadter butterfly systems at high temperatures.</p>

Evidence for bulk superconductivity in pure bismuth single crystals at ambient pressure
<p>At ambient pressure, bulk rhombohedral bismuth is a semimetal that remains in the normal state down to at least 10 millikelvin. Superconductivity in bulk bismuth is thought to be unlikely because of the extremely low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> density. We observed bulk superconductivity in pure bismuth single crystals below 0.53 millikelvin at ambient pressure, with an estimated critical magnetic field of 5.2 microteslas at 0 kelvin. Superconductivity in bismuth cannot be explained by the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory because its adiabatic approximation does not hold true for bismuth. Future theoretical work will be needed to understand superconductivity in the nonadiabatic limit in systems with low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> densities and unusual band structures, such as bismuth.</p>

Selection for a Zinc-Finger Protein Contributes to Seed Oil Increase during Soybean Domestication
<p>Seed oil is a momentous agronomical trait of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) targeted by domestication in breeding. Although multiple oil-related genes have been uncovered, knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of seed oil biosynthesis is currently limited. We demonstrate that the seed-preferred gene <i>GmZF351</i>, encoding a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein, is selected during domestication. Further analysis shows that <i>GmZF351</i> facilitates oil accumulation by directly activating <i>WRINKLED1</i>, <i>BIOTIN CARBOXYL CARRIER PROTEIN2</i>, <i>3-KETOACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN SYNTHASE III</i>, <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i>, and <i>OLEOSIN2</i> in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds. Overexpression of <i>GmZF351</i> in transgenic soybean also activates lipid biosynthesis genes, thereby accelerating seed oil accumulation. The <i>ZF351</i> haplotype from the cultivated soybean group and the wild soybean (<i>Glycine soja</i>) subgroup III correlates well with high gene expression level, seed oil contents and promoter activity, suggesting that selection of <i>GmZF351</i> expression leads to increased seed oil content in cultivated soybean. Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for seed oil accumulation, and the manipulation of <i>GmZF351</i> may have great potential in the improvement of oil production in soybean and other related crops.</p>

Functional Characterization of the <i>GUCY1A3</i> Coronary Artery Disease Risk Locus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A chromosomal locus at 4q32.1 has been genome-wide significantly associated with coronary artery disease risk. The locus encompasses <i>GUCY1A3</i>, which encodes the α<sub>1</sub> subunit of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), a key enzyme in the nitric oxide/cGMP signaling pathway. The mechanism linking common variants in this region with coronary risk is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gene expression and protein expression were analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. Putative allele-specific transcription factors were identified with in silico analyses and validated via allele-specific quantification of antibody-precipitated chromatin fractions. Regulatory properties of the lead risk variant region were analyzed with reporter gene assays. To assess the effect of zinc finger E box-binding homeobox 1 transcription factor (ZEB1), siRNA-mediated knockdown and overexpression experiments were performed. Association of <i>GUCY1A3</i> genotype and cellular phenotypes was analyzed with vascular smooth muscle cell migration assays and platelet aggregation analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Whole-blood <i>GUCY1A3</i> mRNA levels were significantly lower in individuals homozygous for the lead (rs7692387) risk variant. Likewise, reporter gene assays demonstrated significantly lower <i>GUCY1A3</i> promoter activity for constructs carrying this allele. In silico analyses located a DNase I hypersensitivity site to rs7692387 and predicted binding of the transcription factor ZEB1 rather to the nonrisk allele, which was confirmed experimentally. Knockdown of <i>ZEB1</i> resulted in more profound reduction of nonrisk allele promoter activity and a significant reduction of endogenous <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression. Ex vivo–studied platelets from homozygous nonrisk allele <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s displayed enhanced inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation by the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside and the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor sildenafil compared with homozygous risk allele <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s. Moreover, pharmacological stimulation of sGC led to reduced migration only in vascular smooth muscle cells homozygous for the nonrisk allele. In the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, higher levels of <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression correlated with less atherosclerosis in the aorta.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Rs7692387 is located in an intronic site that modulates <i>GUCY1A3</i> promoter activity. The transcription factor ZEB1 binds preferentially to the nonrisk allele, leading to an increase in <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression, higher sGC levels, and higher sGC activity after stimulation. Finally, human and mouse data link augmented sGC expression to lower risk of atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

β<sub>2</sub>-Glycoprotein I/IgA Immune Complexes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by recurrent thrombosis and gestational morbidity in patients with antiphospholipid autoantibodies (aPLs). Predictive value of the presence of aPLs is low, and new markers are necessary to identify aPL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s at higher risk and take preventive measures on them. The presence of circulating immune complexes of IgA bound to β<sub>2</sub>-glycoprotein I (B2A-CIC) has been associated with occurrence of acute thrombotic events. In this work we study its possible predictive value for the appearance of acute thrombotic events in patients who are going to undergo transplant surgery, a well-known trigger of acute thrombotic events in aPL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a follow-up study based on the Magnum 12+12 Cohort of patients who received a kidney transplant (n=1339).

Levels of autoantibodies and B2A-CIC were quantified immediately before the transplant surgery and patients were followed up for 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In group 1, 46.4% of patients experienced any type of thrombosis versus 10.4% in group 2 (<i>P</i><0.001) and 8.6% in the control group (<i>P</i><0.001). The incidence of graft thrombosis in group 1 (31.2%) was significantly higher than that observed in group 2 (3.3%, <i>P</i><0.001) and the control group (2.6%, <i>P</i><0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the presence of B2A-CIC was an independent variable to experience any type of posttransplant thrombosis (hazard ratio, 6.72; 95% confidence interval, 4.81–9.37) and, prominently, for graft thrombosis (hazard ratio, 14.75; 95% confidence interval, 9.11–23.89). No significant differences were found between B2A-CIC–negative and control group patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The presence of B2A-CIC is a predictor of acute thrombotic events. Patients who were positive for IgA aB2GP1 only are at risk of experiencing thrombosis if they are B2A-CIC positive.

Lower Circulating Folate Induced by a Fidgetin Intronic Variant Is Associated With Reduced Congenital Heart Disease Susceptibility
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Folate deficiency is an independent risk factor for congenital heart disease (CHD); however, the maternal plasma folate level is paradoxically not a good diagnostic marker. Genome-wide surveys have identified variants of nonfolate metabolic genes associated with the plasma folate level, suggesting that these genetic polymorphisms are potential risk factors for CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To examine the effects of folate concentration-related variations on CHD risk in the Han Chinese population, we performed 3 independent case-control studies including a total of 1489 patients with CHD and 1745 control subjects. The expression of the Fidgetin (FIGN) was detected in human cardiovascular and decidua tissue specimens with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The molecular mechanisms were investigated by luciferase reporter assays, surface plasmon resonance, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. FIGN-interacting proteins were confirmed by tandem affinity purification and coimmunoprecipitation. Proteasome activity and metabolite concentrations in the folate pathway were quantified with a commercial proteasome activity assay and immunoassays, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The +94762G>C (rs2119289) variant in intron 4 of the <i>FIGN</i> gene was associated with significant reduction in CHD susceptibility (<i>P</i>=5.1×10<sup>−14</sup> for the allele, <i>P</i>=8.5×10<sup>–−13</sup> for the genotype).

Genetic Determinants of Dabigatran Plasma Levels and Their Relation to Bleeding
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Fixed-dose unmonitored treatment with dabigatran etexilate is effective and has a favorable safety profile in the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation patients compared with warfarin. We hypothesized that genetic variants could contribute to interindividual variability in blood concentrations of the active metabolite of dabigatran etexilate and influence the safety and efficacy of dabigatran.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We successfully conducted a genome-wide association study in 2944 Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) participants. The <i>CES1</i> single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2244613 was associated with trough concentrations, and the <i>ABCB1</i> single-nucleotide polymorphism rs4148738 and the <i>CES1</i> single-nucleotide polymorphism rs8192935 were associated with peak concentrations at genome-wide significance (<i>P</i><9×10<sup>−8</sup>) with a gene-dose effect.

Detection of the aromatic molecule benzonitrile (<i>c</i>-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CN) in the interstellar medium
<p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic nitrogen heterocycles are thought to be widespread throughout the universe, because these classes of molecules are probably responsible for the unidentified infrared bands, a set of emission features seen in numerous Galactic and extragalactic sources. Despite their expected ubiquity, astronomical identification of specific aromatic molecules has proven elusive. We present the discovery of benzonitrile (<i>c</i>-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CN), one of the simplest nitrogen-bearing aromatic molecules, in the interstellar medium. We observed hyperfine-resolved transitions of benzonitrile in emission from the molecular cloud TMC-1. Simple aromatic molecules such as benzonitrile may be precursors for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon formation, providing a chemical link to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s of the unidentified infrared bands.</p>

Numerical evidence of fluctuating stripes in the normal state of high-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> cuprate superconductors
<p>Upon doping, Mott insulators often exhibit symmetry breaking where charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s and their spins organize into patterns known as stripes. For high–transition temperature cuprate superconductors, stripes are widely suspected to exist in a fluctuating form. We used numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations to demonstrate dynamical stripe correlations in the three-band Hubbard model, which represents the local electronic structure of the copper-oxygen plane. Our results, which are robust to varying parameters, cluster size, and boundary conditions, support the interpretation of experimental observations such as the hourglass magnetic dispersion and the Yamada plot of incommensurability versus doping in terms of the physics of fluctuating stripes. These findings provide a different perspective on the intertwined orders emerging from the cuprates’ normal state.</p>

Perovskite solar cells with CuSCN hole extraction layers yield stabilized efficiencies greater than 20%
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with efficiencies greater than 20% have been realized only with expensive organic hole-transporting materials. We demonstrate PSCs that achieve stabilized efficiencies exceeding 20% with copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) as the hole extraction layer. A fast solvent removal method enabled the creation of compact, highly conformal CuSCN layers that facilitate rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> extraction and collection. The PSCs showed high thermal stability under long-term heating, although their operational stability was poor. This instability originated from potential-induced degradation of the CuSCN/Au contact. The addition of a conductive reduced graphene oxide spacer layer between CuSCN and gold allowed PSCs to retain >95% of their initial efficiency after aging at a maximum power point for 1000 hours under full solar intensity at 60°C. Under both continuous full-sun illumination and thermal stress, CuSCN-based devices surpassed the stability of spiro-OMeTAD–based PSCs.</p>

Destruction and reformation of an iron-sulfur cluster during catalysis by lipoyl synthase
<p>Lipoyl synthase (LipA) catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of the lipoyl cofactor, which is the attachment of two sulfhydryl groups to C6 and C8 of a pendant octanoyl chain. The appended sulfur atoms derive from an auxiliary [4Fe-4S] cluster on the protein that is degraded during turnover, limiting LipA to one turnover in vitro. We found that the <i>Escherichia coli</i> iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> protein NfuA efficiently reconstitutes the auxiliary cluster during LipA catalysis in a step that is not rate-limiting. We also found evidence for a second pathway for cluster regeneration involving the <i>E. coli</i> protein IscU. These results show that enzymes that degrade their Fe-S clusters as a sulfur source can nonetheless act catalytically. Our results also explain why patients with <i>NFU1</i> gene deletions exhibit phenotypes that are indicative of lipoyl cofactor deficiencies.</p>

Direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials
<p>Photolithography is an important manufacturing process that relies on using photoresists, typically polymer formulations, that change solubility when illuminated with ultraviolet light. Here, we introduce a general chemical approach for photoresist-free, direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials. The patterned materials can be metals, semiconductors, oxides, magnetic, or rare earth compositions. No organic impurities are present in the patterned layers, which helps achieve good electronic and optical properties. The conductivity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> mobility, dielectric, and luminescence properties of optically patterned layers are on par with the properties of state-of-the-art solution-processed materials. The ability to directly pattern all-inorganic layers by using a light exposure dose comparable with that of organic photoresists provides an alternate route for thin-film device manufacturing.</p>

They show that at physiologic concentrations (2 to 8 mM), the physical properties of ATP alone enable it to dissolve liquid-liquid phase-separated droplets and amyloid fibers. These findings suggest an additional way for cells to use ATP to maintain proteostasis in the crowded cytoplasm and also fine-tune the material properties of nonmembrane-bound organelles and the cell interior in general.</p>

Extremely efficient internal exciton dissociation through edge states in layered 2D perovskites
<p>Understanding and controlling charge and energy flow in state-of-the-art semiconductor quantum wells has enabled high-efficiency optoelectronic devices. Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites are solution-processed quantum wells wherein the band gap can be tuned by varying the perovskite-layer thickness, which modulates the effective electron-hole confinement. We report that, counterintuitive to classical quantum-confined systems where photogenerated electrons and holes are strongly bound by Coulomb interactions or excitons, the photophysics of thin films made of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a thickness exceeding two perovskite-crystal units (>1.3 nanometers) is dominated by lower-energy states associated with the local intrinsic electronic structure of the edges of the perovskite layers. These states provide a direct pathway for dissociating excitons into longer-lived free <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s that substantially improve the performance of optoelectronic devices.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing metallic hydrogen has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. Metallic hydrogen may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, hydrogen becomes metallic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the atomic density.

Anomalously low electronic thermal conductivity in metallic vanadium dioxide

Violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law are typically an indication of unconventional quasiparticle dynamics, such as inelastic scattering, or hydrodynamic collective motion of charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s, typically pronounced only at cryogenic temperatures. We report an order-of-magnitude breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law at high temperatures ranging from 240 to 340 kelvin in metallic vanadium dioxide in the vicinity of its metal-insulator transition. Different from previously established mechanisms, the unusually low electronic thermal conductivity is a signature of the absence of quasiparticles in a strongly correlated electron fluid where heat and charge diffuse independently.</p>

Super-dry reforming of methane intensifies CO<sub>2</sub> utilization via Le Chatelier’s principle
<p>Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> transformation from a waste product to a carbon source for chemicals and fuels will require reaction conditions that effect its reduction. We developed a “super-dry” CH<sub>4</sub> reforming reaction for enhanced CO production from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. We used Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a CH<sub>4</sub>-reforming catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a solid oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>, and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a CO<sub>2</sub> sorbent. The isothermal coupling of these three different processes resulted in higher CO production as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding back reactions with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH<sub>4</sub> conversion to syngas over Ni and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction and storage as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is then used for iron reoxidation and CO production, exploiting equilibrium shifts effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier’s principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per CH<sub>4</sub> and offers a high CO space-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin.</p>

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons transmitted across a ballistic semiconductor junction are expected to undergo refraction, analogous to light rays across an optical boundary.

Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the propagation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s across an electrostatically defined graphene junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell’s law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative refraction. Resonant transmission across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent transmission coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for realizing electron optics based on graphene p-n junctions.</p>

Pinstatic Acid Promotes Auxin Transport by Inhibiting PIN Internalization
<p>Polar auxin transport plays a pivotal role in plant growth and development. PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s regulate directional auxin movement by establishing local auxin maxima, minima, and gradients that drive multiple developmental processes and responses to environmental signals. Auxin has been proposed to modulate its own transport by regulating subcellular PIN trafficking via processes such as clathrin-mediated PIN endocytosis and constitutive recycling. Here, we further investigated the mechanisms by which auxin affects PIN trafficking by screening auxin analogs and identified pinstatic acid (PISA) as a positive modulator of polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). PISA had an auxin-like effect on hypocotyl elongation and adventitious root formation via positive regulation of auxin transport. PISA did not activate SCF<sup>TIR1/AFB</sup> signaling and yet induced PIN accumulation at the cell surface by inhibiting PIN internalization from the plasma membrane. This work demonstrates PISA to be a promising chemical tool to dissect the regulatory mechanisms behind subcellular PIN trafficking and auxin transport.</p>

Mitochondrial Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Contributes to Auxin-Regulated Organ Development
<p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme (E1) of the PDH complex (PDC). This multienzyme complex contains E1, E2, and E3 components and controls the entry of carbon into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle to enable cellular energy production. The E1 component of the PDC is composed of an E1α catalytic subunit and an E1β regulatory subunit. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are two mitochondrial E1α homologs encoded by <i>IAA-CONJUGATE-RESISTANT 4</i> (<i>IAR4</i>) and <i>IAR4-LIKE</i> (<i>IAR4L</i>), and one mitochondrial E1β homolog. Although IAR4 was reported to be involved in auxin conjugate sensitivity and auxin homeostasis in root development, its precise role remains unknown. Here, we provide experimental evidence that mitochondrial PDC E1 contributes to polar auxin transport during organ development. We performed genetic screens for factors involved in cotyledon development and identified an uncharacterized mutant, <i>macchi-bou 1</i> (<i>mab1</i>). <i>MAB1</i> encodes a mitochondrial PDC E1β subunit that can form both a homodimer and a heterodimer with IAR4. The <i>mab1</i> mutation impaired MAB1 homodimerization, reduced the abundance of IAR4 and IAR4L, weakened PDC enzymatic activity, and diminished mitochondrial respiration. A metabolomics analysis showed significant changes in metabolites including amino acids in <i>mab1</i> and, in particular, identified an accumulation of Ala. These results suggest that MAB1 is a component of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial PDC E1. Furthermore, in <i>mab1</i> mutants and seedlings where the TCA cycle was pharmacologically blocked, we found reduced abundance of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s, possibly due to impaired PIN recycling and enhanced PIN degradation in vacuoles. Therefore, we suggest that <i>mab1</i> induces defective polar auxin transport via metabolic abnormalities.</p>

Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carriers Prevent Cadmium Toxicity by Sustaining the TCA Cycle and Glutathione Synthesis
<p>Cadmium (Cd) is a major heavy metal pollutant, and Cd toxicity is a serious cause of abiotic stress in the environment. Plants protect themselves against Cd stress through a variety of pathways. In a recent study, we found that mitochondrial pyruvate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s (MPCs) are involved in Cd tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Following the identification of MPCs in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) in 2012, most studies have focused on the function of MPCs in animals, as a possible approach to reduce the risk of cancer developing. The results of this study show that AtMPC protein complexes are required for Cd tolerance and prevention of Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis. AtMPC complexes are composed of two elements, AtMPC1 and AtMPC2 (AtNRGA1 or AtMPC3). When the formation of AtMPCs was interrupted by the loss of <i>AtMPC1</i>, glutamate could supplement the synthesis of acetyl-coenzyme A and sustain the TCA cycle. With the up-regulation of glutathione synthesis following exposure to Cd stress, the supplementary pathway could not efficiently drive the tricarboxylic acid cycle without AtMPC. The ATP content decreased concomitantly with the deletion of tricarboxylic acid activity, which led to Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis. More importantly, ScMPCs were also required for Cd tolerance in yeast. Our results suggest that the mechanism of Cd tolerance may be similar in other species.</p>

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p>Auxin has been shown to enhance root growth inhibition under aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), auxin may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of root growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize auxin efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root growth inhibition. Root growth in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to auxin, was less inhibited by Al stress than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root tips displayed higher auxin accumulation and enhanced auxin signaling under Al stress, which was also consistent with the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the auxin-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al stress reduced the level of auxin in the root tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al stress-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more auxin in their root tips. In addition, Al stress induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al stress is associated with reduced auxin accumulation in root tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes inhibition of root growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of auxin and auxin polar transport in Al-induced root growth regulation in maize.</p>

The sHSP22 Heat Shock Protein Requires the ABI1 Protein Phosphatase to Modulate Polar Auxin Transport and Downstream Responses
<p>The phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) response pathways interact synergistically or antagonistically to regulate plant development and environmental adaptation. Here, we show that <i>ABI1</i>, a key negative regulator of ABA signaling, is essential for auxin-modulated root development. We performed a microarray analysis using the loss-of-function mutant <i>abi1-3</i> and Col-0 seedlings treated with IAA. For <i>sHSP22</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) small heat shock protein-encoding gene, the induction by IAA was dependent on <i>ABI1</i>. <i>shsp22</i> displayed enhanced sensitivity to ABA in primary root growth. In contrast, overexpression of full-length, but not truncated sHSP22 lacking signal peptide and ER-retention sequences, resulted in decreased ABA sensitivity. Overexpressed (OX) <i>sHSP22</i> partially rescued the ABA hypersensitivity of <i>abi1-3</i>. In addition, <i>sHSP22</i> is involved in auxin-regulated hypocotyl elongation at high temperature treatment. <i>sHSP22</i> also affected accumulation of auxin efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> PIN proteins due to potentiated intracellular trafficking.

Vacuolar Trafficking Protein VPS38 Is Dispensable for Autophagy
<p>Phosphatidylinositol 3-P (PI3P) is a signaling molecule that controls a variety of processes in endosomal, autophagic, and vacuolar/lysosomal trafficking in yeasts and mammals. Vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34) is a conserved PI3K present in multiple complexes with specific functions and regulation. In yeast, the PI3K complex II consists of Vps34p, Vps15p, Vps30p/Atg6p, and Vps38p, and is essential for vacuolar protein sorting. Here, we describe the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homolog of yeast Vps38p and human UV radiation resistance-associated gene protein. Arabidopsis VPS38 interacts with VPS30/ATG6 both in yeast and in planta. Although the level of PI3P in Arabidopsis <i>vps38</i> mutants is similar to that in wild type, <i>vps38</i> cells contain enlarged multivesicular endosomes and fewer organelles enriched in PI3P than the wild type. The <i>vps38</i> mutants are defective in the trafficking of vacuolar cargo and its receptor VACUOLAR SORTING RECEPTOR2;1. The mutants also exhibit abnormal cytoplasmic distributions of endocytic cargo, such as auxin efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s PINFORMED1 (PIN1) and PIN2. Constitutive autophagy is normal in the mutants but starvation-induced autophagy was slightly inhibited. We conclude that Arabidopsis VPS38 is dispensable for autophagy but essential for efficient targeting of biosynthetic and endocytic cargo to the vacuole.</p>

Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s that generate subcellular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>

Impaired Malate and Fumarate Accumulation Due to the Mutation of the Tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter Has Little Effects on Stomatal Behavior
<p>Malate is a central metabolite involved in a multiplicity of plant metabolic pathways, being associated with mitochondrial metabolism and playing significant roles in stomatal movements. Vacuolar malate transport has been characterized at the molecular level and is performed by at least one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> protein and two channels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) vacuoles. The absence of the Arabidopsis tonoplast Dicarboxylate Transporter (tDT) in the <i>tdt</i> knockout mutant was associated previously with an impaired accumulation of malate and fumarate in leaves. Here, we investigated the consequences of this lower accumulation on stomatal behavior and photosynthetic capacity as well as its putative metabolic impacts. Neither the stomatal conductance nor the kinetic responses to dark, light, or high CO<sub>2</sub> were highly affected in <i>tdt</i> plants. In addition, we did not observe any impact on stomatal aperture following incubation with abscisic acid, malate, or citrate. Furthermore, an effect on photosynthetic capacity was not observed in the mutant lines. However, leaf mitochondrial metabolism was affected in the <i>tdt</i> plants. Levels of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle were altered, and increases in both light and dark respiration were observed. We conclude that manipulation of the tonoplastic organic acid transporter impacted mitochondrial metabolism, while the overall stomatal and photosynthetic capacity were unaffected.</p>

Root Bending Is Antagonistically Affected by Hypoxia and ERF-Mediated Transcription via Auxin Signaling
<p>When plants encounter soil water logging or flooding, roots are the first organs to be confronted with reduced gas diffusion resulting in limited oxygen supply. Since roots do not generate photosynthetic oxygen, they are rapidly faced with oxygen shortage rendering roots particularly prone to damage. While metabolic adaptations to low oxygen conditions, which ensure basic energy supply, have been well characterized, adaptation of root growth and development have received less attention. In this study, we show that hypoxic conditions cause the primary root to grow sidewise in a low oxygen environment, possibly to escape soil patches with reduced oxygen availability. This growth behavior is reversible in that gravitropic growth resumes when seedlings are returned to normoxic conditions. Hypoxic root bending is inhibited by the group VII ethylene response factor (ERFVII) RAP2.12, as <i>rap2.12-1</i> seedlings show exaggerated primary root bending. Furthermore, overexpression of the ERFVII member <i>HRE2</i> inhibits root bending, suggesting that primary root growth direction at hypoxic conditions is antagonistically regulated by hypoxia and hypoxia-activated ERFVIIs. Root bending is preceded by the establishment of an auxin gradient across the root tip as quantified with DII-VENUS and is synergistically enhanced by hypoxia and the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid. The protein abundance of the auxin efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> PIN2 is reduced at hypoxic conditions, a response that is suppressed by RAP2.12 overexpression, suggesting antagonistic control of auxin flux by hypoxia and ERFVII. Taken together, we show that hypoxia triggers an escape response of the primary root that is controlled by ERFVII activity and mediated by auxin signaling in the root tip.</p>

Stearoyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Desaturase Mutations Uncover an Impact of Stearic Acid in Leaf and Nodule Structure
<p>Stearoyl-acyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> protein desaturase (SACPD-C) has been reported to control the accumulation of seed stearic acid; however, no study has previously reported its involvement in leaf stearic acid content and impact on leaf structure and morphology. A subset of an ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenized population of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) ‘Forrest’ was screened to identify mutants within the <i>GmSACPD-C</i> gene. Using a forward genetics approach, one nonsense and four missense <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutants were identified to have high levels of seed, nodule, and leaf stearic acid content. Homology modeling and in silico analysis of the GmSACPD-C enzyme revealed that most of these mutations were localized near or at conserved residues essential for diiron ion coordination. Soybeans carrying <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations at conserved residues showed the highest stearic acid content, and these mutations were found to have deleterious effects on nodule development and function. Interestingly, mutations at nonconserved residues show an increase in stearic acid content yet retain healthy nodules. Thus, random mutagenesis and mutational analysis allows for the achievement of high seed stearic acid content with no associated negative agronomic characteristics. Additionally, expression analysis demonstrates that nodule leghemoglobin transcripts were significantly more abundant in soybeans with deleterious mutations at conserved residues of GmSACPD-C. Finally, we report that <i>Gmsacpd-c</i> mutations cause an increase in leaf stearic acid content and an alteration of leaf structure and morphology in addition to differences in nitrogen-fixing nodule structure.</p>

Discovery and Characterization of the 3-Hydroxyacyl-ACP Dehydratase Component of the Plant Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Synthase System
<p>We report the characterization of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) 3-hydroxyacyl-acyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong> protein dehydratase (mtHD) component of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthase (mtFAS) system, encoded by AT5G60335. The mitochondrial localization and catalytic capability of mtHD were demonstrated with a green fluorescent protein transgenesis experiment and by in vivo complementation and in vitro enzymatic assays. RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown lines with reduced <i>mtHD</i> expression exhibit traits typically associated with mtFAS mutants, namely a miniaturized morphological appearance, reduced lipoylation of lipoylated proteins, and altered metabolomes consistent with the reduced catalytic activity of lipoylated enzymes. These alterations are reversed when <i>mthd-rnai</i> mutant plants are grown in a 1% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, indicating the link between mtFAS and photorespiratory deficiency due to the reduced lipoylation of glycine decarboxylase. In vivo biochemical feeding experiments illustrate that sucrose and glycolate are the metabolic modulators that mediate the alterations in morphology and lipid accumulation. In addition, both <i>mthd-rnai</i> and <i>mtkas</i> mutants exhibit reduced accumulation of 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid (i.e. a hallmark of lipid A-like molecules) and abnormal chloroplastic starch granules; these changes are not reversible by the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, demonstrating two novel mtFAS functions that are independent of photorespiration. Finally, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that <i>mthd-rnai</i> and <i>mtkas</i> mutants are nearly equivalent to each other in altering the transcriptome, and these analyses further identified genes whose expression is affected by a functional mtFAS system but independent of photorespiratory deficiency. These data demonstrate the nonredundant nature of the mtFAS system, which contributes unique lipid components needed to support plant cell structure and metabolism.</p>

Phosphorylation of SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE by the MPK3/6 Kinase Is Required for Anther Development
<p>Germ cells are indispensable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s of genetic information from one generation to the next. In contrast to the well-understood process in animals, information on the mechanism of germ cell initiation in plants is very limited. <i>SPOROCYTELESS</i>/<i>NOZZLE</i> was previously identified as an essential regulator of diploid germ cell (archesporial cell) differentiation in the stamens and ovules of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Although <i>SPOROCYTELESS</i> (<i>SPL</i>) transcription is activated by the floral organ identity regulator AGAMOUS and epigenetically regulated by SET DOMAIN GROUP2, little is known about the regulation of the SPL protein. Here, we report that the protein kinases MPK3 and MPK6 can both interact with SPL in vitro and in vivo and can phosphorylate the SPL protein in vitro. In addition, phosphorylation of the SPL protein by MPK3/6 is required for SPL function in the Arabidopsis anther, as measured by its effect on archesporial cell differentiation. We further demonstrate that phosphorylation enhances SPL protein stability. This work not only uncovers the importance of SPL phosphorylation for its regulatory role in Arabidopsis anther development, but also supports the hypothesis that the regulation of precise spatiotemporal patterning of germ cell initiation and that differentiation is achieved progressively through multiple levels of regulation, including transcriptional and posttranslational modification.</p>

NAD Acts as an Integral Regulator of Multiple Defense Layers
<p>Pyridine nucleotides, such as NAD, are crucial redox <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carrier</span></strong>s and have emerged as important signaling molecules in stress responses. Previously, we have demonstrated in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that the inducible NAD-overproducing <i>nadC</i> lines are more resistant to an avirulent strain of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst-AvrRpm1</i>), which was associated with salicylic acid-dependent defense. Here, we have further characterized the NAD-dependent immune response in Arabidopsis. Quinolinate-induced stimulation of intracellular NAD in transgenic <i>nadC</i> plants enhanced resistance against a diverse range of (a)virulent pathogens, including <i>Pst-AvrRpt2</i>, <i>Dickeya dadantii</i>, and <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Characterization of the redox status demonstrated that elevated NAD levels induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the expression of redox marker genes of the cytosol and mitochondrion. Using pharmacological and reverse genetics approaches, we show that NAD-induced ROS production functions independently of NADPH oxidase activity and light metabolism but depends on mitochondrial respiration, which was increased at higher NAD. We further demonstrate that NAD primes pathogen-induced callose deposition and cell death. Mass spectrometry analysis reveals that NAD simultaneously induces different defense hormones and that the NAD-induced metabolic profiles are similar to those of defense-expressing plants after treatment with pathogen-associated molecular patterns. We thus conclude that NAD triggers metabolic profiles rather similar to that of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and discuss how signaling cross talk between defense hormones, ROS, and NAD explains the observed resistance to pathogens.</p>

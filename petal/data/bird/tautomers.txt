Structure-Activity Relation of AMOR Sugar Molecule That Activates Pollen-Tubes for Ovular Guidance
<p>Successful fertilization in flowering plants depends on the precise directional growth control of pollen tube through the female pistil tissue toward the female gametophyte contained in the ovule for delivery of nonmotile sperm cells. Cys-rich peptides LUREs secreted from the synergid cells on either side of the egg cell act as ovular attractants of pollen tubes. Competency control by the pistil is crucial for the response of pollen tubes to these ovular attractants. We recently reported that ovular 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl arabinogalactan (AMOR) induces competency of the pollen tube to respond to ovular attractant LURE peptides in <i>Torenia fournieri.</i> The beta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>er of the terminal disaccharide 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl galactose was essential and sufficient for the competency induction. However, critical and noncritical structures in the disaccharide have not been dissected deeply. Herein, we report the synthesis of new AMOR analogs and the structure-activity relationships for AMOR activity in the presence of these synthesized analogs. Removal of 4-<i>O</i>-methyl group or –COOH from the glucuronosyl residue of the disaccharide dramatically reduces AMOR activity. The pyranose backbone of the second sugar of disaccharide is essential for the activity but not hydroxy groups. The role of beta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>er of the disaccharide 4-Me-GlcA-β(1,6)-Gal is very specific for competency control, as there was no difference in effect among the sugar analogs tested for pollen germination. This study represents the first structure-activity relationship study, to our knowledge, of a sugar molecule involved in plant reproduction, which opens a way for modification of the molecule without loss of activity.</p>

Can honey bees discriminate between floral-fragrance isomers?
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Discrimination of floral-fragrance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>ers by bees is difficult, even under learning protocols that enhance discrimination; thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>ers may not necessarily enhance plant odor diversity for pollinators.</p>

Delayed catalyst function enables direct enantioselective conversion of nitriles to NH<sub>2</sub>-amines
<p>Accessing enantiomerically enriched amines often demands oxidation-state adjustments, protection and deprotection processes, and purification procedures that increase cost and waste, limiting applicability. When diastereomers can be formed, one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>er is attainable. Here, we show that nitriles, largely viewed as insufficiently reactive, can be transformed directly to multifunctional unprotected homoallylic amines by enantioselective addition of a carbon-based nucleophile and diastereodivergent reduction of the resulting ketimine. Successful implementation requires that competing copper-based catalysts be present simultaneously and that the slower-forming and less reactive one engages first. This challenge was addressed by incorporation of a nonproductive side cycle, fueled selectively by inexpensive additives, to delay the function of the more active catalyst. The utility of this approach is highlighted by its application to the efficient preparation of the anticancer agent (+)-tangutorine.</p>

Herbivores as drivers of negative density dependence in tropical forest saplings
<p>Ecological theory predicts that the high local diversity observed in tropical forests is maintained by negative density–dependent interactions within and between closely related plant species. By using long-term data on tree growth and survival for coexisting <i>Inga</i> (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">congen</span></strong>ers, we tested two mechanisms thought to underlie negative density dependence (NDD): competition for resources and attack by herbivores. We quantified the similarity of neighbors in terms of key ecological traits that mediate these interactions, as well as the similarity of herbivore communities. We show that phytochemical similarity and shared herbivore communities are associated with decreased growth and survival at the sapling stage, a key bottleneck in the life cycle of tropical trees. None of the traits associated with resource acquisition affect plant performance, indicating that competition between neighbors may not shape local tree diversity. These results suggest that herbivore pressure is the primary mechanism driving NDD at the sapling stage.</p>

Chemically reversible isomerization of inorganic clusters
<p>Structural transformations in molecules and solids have generally been studied in isolation, whereas intermediate systems have eluded characterization. We show that a pair of cadmium sulfide (CdS) cluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>ers provides an advantageous experimental platform to study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>erization in well-defined, atomically precise systems. The clusters coherently interconvert over an ~1–electron volt energy barrier with a 140–milli–electron volt shift in their excitonic energy gaps. There is a diffusionless, displacive reconfiguration of the inorganic core (solid-solid transformation) with first order (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>erization-like) transformation kinetics. Driven by a distortion of the ligand-binding motifs, the presence of hydroxyl species changes the surface energy via physisorption, which determines “phase” stability in this system. This reaction possesses essential characteristics of both solid-solid transformations and molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>erizations and bridges these disparate length scales.</p>

“Ab initio” synthesis of zeolites for preestablished catalytic reactions
<p>Unlike homogeneous catalysts that are often designed for particular reactions, zeolites are heterogeneous catalysts that are explored and optimized in a heuristic fashion. We present a methodology for synthesizing active and selective zeolites by using organic structure-directing agents that mimic the transition state (TS) of preestablished reactions to be catalyzed. In these zeolites, the pores and cavities could be generated approaching a molecular-recognition pattern. For disproportionation of toluene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>erization of ethylbenzene into xylenes, the TSs are larger than the reaction products. Zeolite ITQ-27 showed high disproportionation activity, and ITQ-64 showed high selectivity for the desired para and ortho <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>ers. For the case of a product and TS of similar size, we synthesized a catalyst, MIT-1, for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>erization of <i>endo</i>-dicyclopentane into adamantane.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms of Photoadaptation of Photosystem I Supercomplex from an Evolutionary Cyanobacterial/Algal Intermediate
<p>The monomeric photosystem I-light-harvesting antenna complex I (PSI-LHCI) supercomplex from the extremophilic red alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i> represents an intermediate evolutionary link between the cyanobacterial PSI reaction center and its green algal/higher plant counterpart. We show that the <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex is characterized by robustness in various extreme conditions. By a combination of biochemical, spectroscopic, mass spectrometry, and electron microscopy/single particle analyses, we dissected three molecular mechanisms underlying the inherent robustness of the <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex: (1) the accumulation of photoprotective zeaxanthin in the LHCI antenna and the PSI reaction center; (2) structural remodeling of the LHCI antenna and adjustment of the effective absorption cross section; and (3) dynamic readjustment of the stoichiometry of the two PSI-LHCI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>ers and changes in the oligomeric state of the PSI-LHCI supercomplex, accompanied by dissociation of the PsaK core subunit. We show that the largest low light-treated <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex can bind up to eight Lhcr antenna subunits, which are organized as two rows on the PsaF/PsaJ side of the core complex. Under our experimental conditions, we found no evidence of functional coupling of the phycobil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>es with the PSI-LHCI supercomplex purified from various light conditions, suggesting that the putative association of this antenna with the PSI supercomplex is absent or may be lost during the purification procedure.</p>

BAG3 (Bcl-2–Associated Athanogene-3) Coding Variant in Mice Determines Susceptibility to Ischemic Limb Muscle Myopathy by Directing Autophagy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Critical limb ischemia is a manifestation of peripheral artery disease that carries significant mortality and morbidity risk in humans, although its genetic determinants remain largely unknown. We previously discovered 2 overlapping quantitative trait loci in mice, <i>Lsq-1</i> and <i>Civq-1</i>, that affected limb muscle survival and stroke volume after femoral artery or middle cerebral artery ligation, respectively. Here, we report that a <i>Bag3</i> variant (Ile81Met) segregates with tissue protection from hind-limb ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We treated mice with either adeno-associated viruses encoding a control (green fluorescent protein) or 2 BAG3 (Bcl-2–associated athanogene-3) variants, namely Met81 or Ile81, and subjected the mice to hind-limb ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that the BAG3 Ile81Met variant in the C57BL/6 (BL6) mouse background segregates with protection from tissue necrosis in a shorter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">congen</span></strong>ic fragment of <i>Lsq-1</i> (C.B6–<i>Lsq1-3</i>). BALB/c mice treated with adeno-associated virus encoding the BL6 BAG3 variant (Ile81; n=25) displayed reduced limb-tissue necrosis and increased limb tissue perfusion compared with Met81- (n=25) or green fluorescent protein– (n=29) expressing animals. BAG3<sup>Ile81</sup>, but not BAG3<sup>Met81</sup>, improved ischemic muscle myopathy and muscle precursor cell differentiation and improved muscle regeneration in a separate, toxin-induced model of injury. Systemic injection of adeno-associated virus–BAG3<sup>Ile81</sup> (n=9), but not BAG3<sup>Met81</sup> (n=10) or green fluorescent protein (n=5), improved ischemic limb blood flow and limb muscle histology and restored muscle function (force production). Compared with BAG3<sup>Met81</sup>, BAG3<sup>Ile81</sup> displayed improved binding to the small heat shock protein (HspB8) in ischemic skeletal muscle cells and enhanced ischemic muscle autophagic flux.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Taken together, our data demonstrate that genetic variation in BAG3 plays an important role in the prevention of ischemic tissue necrosis. These results highlight a pathway that preserves tissue survival and muscle function in the setting of ischemia.</p></sec>

Bees with attitude: the effects of directed gusts on flight trajectories
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The effect of atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gust</span></strong>s on the flight trajectories of bumblebees, reporting motion of flight influenced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gust</span></strong>s along with flapping-enabled control strategies that could be necessary elements of flight at this scale.</p>

Avoiding topsy-turvy: how Anna's hummingbirds (<i>Calypte anna</i>) fly through upward gusts
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Hummingbirds flying through intense upward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gust</span></strong>s experience pronounced downward pitching motions (i.e. nose dives). In response, they interrupt flapping, hold the wings dorsally, and angle and fan the tail.</p>

Gliding for a free lunch: biomechanics of foraging flight in common swifts (<i>Apus apus</i>)
<p><bold>Highlighted Article:</bold> Foraging common swifts spend the majority of their time gliding while making use of environmental energy such as thermals and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gust</span></strong>s which, on average, completely cover the cost of flight.</p>

Fixation and clinical outcome of uncemented peri-apatite-coated <i>versus</i> cemented total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The optimal method of tibial component fixation remains uncertain   in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Hydroxyapatite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ings have been   applied to improve bone ingrowth in uncemented designs, but may   only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> the directly accessible surface. As peri-apatite (PA)   is solution deposited, this may increase the coverage of the implant   surface and thereby fixation. We assessed the tibial component fixation   of uncemented PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed TKAs <i>versus</i> cemented TKAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed or cemented TKAs. In 60   patients (30 in each group), radiostereometric analysis of tibial   component migration was evaluated as the primary outcome at baseline,   three months post-operatively and at one, two and five years. A   linear mixed-effects model was used to analyse the repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After five years of follow-up, one (cemented) component was revised   due to ligament instability. Overall, uncemented PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed tibial   components migrated significantly more    (p = 0.003), with the mean maximum total point motion (MTPM) at   five years being 0.62 mm (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.49 to   0.76) for cemented tibial components and 0.97 mm (95% CI 0.81 to   1.15) for PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed tibial components in TKA. However, between three   months and five years the cemented TKAs migrated significantly more   (p = 0.02), displaying a MTPM of 0.27 mm (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.36) <i>versus</i> 0.13   mm (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.25) for PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed tibial components. One implant   in each group was considered at risk for aseptic loosening due to continuous   migration after five years of follow-up, albeit with different migration   patterns for each group (i.e. higher initial migration but diminishing   over time for the PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed component <i>versus</i> gradually   increasing migration for the cemented component).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The tibial components of PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed TKAs showed more overall migration   compared with the tibial components of cemented TKAs. However, <i>post   hoc</i> analysis showed that this difference was caused by   higher migration of PA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed components in the first three months,   after which a stable migration pattern was observed.

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s that are active catalysts for methane (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>ing temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> catalysts for pyrolysis of methane into hydrogen and carbon. All solid catalysts previously used for this reaction have been deactivated by carbon deposition. In the molten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> system, the insoluble carbon floats to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> achieved 95% methane conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure hydrogen without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products. Calculations show that the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s in the molten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s are atomically dispersed and negatively charged.

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the seed mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole seed. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> mucilage formation.</p>

The <i>in vivo</i> effect of a porous titanium alloy flange with hydroxyapatite, silver and fibronectin coatings on soft-tissue integration of intraosseous transcutaneous amputation prostheses
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The Intraosseous Transcutaneous Amputation Prosthesis (ITAP)   may improve quality of life for amputees by avoiding soft-tissue   complications associated with socket prostheses and by improving   sensory feedback and function.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

The MYB107 Transcription Factor Positively Regulates Suberin Biosynthesis
<p>Suberin, a lipophilic polymer deposited in the outer integument of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>, represents an essential sealing component controlling water and solute movement and protecting seed from pathogenic infection. Although many genes responsible for suberin synthesis are identified, the regulatory components controlling its biosynthesis have not been definitively determined. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis MYB107 transcription factor acts as a positive regulator controlling suberin biosynthetic gene expression in the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>. <i>MYB107</i> coexpresses with suberin biosynthetic genes in a temporal manner during seed development. Disrupting <i>MYB107</i> particularly suppresses the expression of genes involved in suberin but not cutin biosynthesis, lowers seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> suberin accumulation, alters suberin lamellar structure, and consequently renders higher seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> permeability and susceptibility to abiotic stresses. Furthermore, MYB107 directly binds to the promoters of suberin biosynthetic genes, verifying its primary role in regulating their expression. Identifying MYB107 as a positive regulator for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> suberin synthesis offers a basis for discovering the potential transcriptional network behind one of the most abundant lipid-based polymers in nature.</p>

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor ductility owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made ductile by specific dilute solute additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued plastic straining during deformation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for ductility as a function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s, and the solute-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium. The mechanistic theory can quickly screen for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> compositions favoring conditions for high ductility and may help in the development of high-formability magnesium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ing either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ing promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

A liquid metal reaction environment for the room-temperature synthesis of atomically thin metal oxides
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) oxides have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many oxides are not easy to synthesize as 2D materials through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s as a reaction solvent and co-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>ed desired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melt</span></strong>. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, we predicted the composition of the self-limiting interfacial oxide. We isolated the surface oxide as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in suspension. This enabled us to produce extremely thin subnanometer layers of HfO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>–based reaction route can be used to create 2D materials that were previously inaccessible with preexisting methods.

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>s, and their expression requires seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

The primary safety end point was freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days, and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months.

Disparities in science literacy
<p>Much is known about how adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy varies internationally and over time, and about its association with attitudes and beliefs. However, less is known about disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy across racial and ethnic groups (<i>1</i>). This is particularly surprising in light of substantial research on racial and ethnic disparities in related areas such as educational achievement, math and reading ability (<i>2</i>), representation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) occupations (<i>3</i>), and health literacy (<i>4</i>). Given the importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy to securing and sustaining many jobs, to understanding key health concepts to enhance quality of life, and to increasing public engagement in societal decision-making (<i>5</i>), it is concerning if the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy is unequally stratified, particularly if this stratification reflects broader patterns of disadvantage and cultural dominance as experienced by minorities and educationally underserved populations. We describe here such disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy in the United States and attempt to explain underlying drivers, concluding that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy disadvantage among black and Hispanic adults relative to whites is only partially explained by measures of broader, foundational literacies and socioeconomic status (SES).</p>

Heavy Metals Induce Iron Deficiency Responses at Different Hierarchic and Regulatory Levels
<p>In plants, the excess of several heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s mimics iron (Fe) deficiency-induced chlorosis, indicating a disturbance in Fe homeostasis. To examine the level at which heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s interfere with Fe deficiency responses, we carried out an in-depth characterization of Fe-related physiological, regulatory, and morphological responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exposed to heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s. Enhanced zinc (Zn) uptake closely mimicked Fe deficiency by leading to low chlorophyll but high ferric-chelate reductase activity and coumarin release. These responses were not caused by Zn-inhibited Fe uptake via IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER (IRT1). Instead, Zn simulated the transcriptional response of typical Fe-regulated genes, indicating that Zn affects Fe homeostasis at the level of Fe sensing. Excess supplies of cobalt and nickel altered root traits in a different way from Fe deficiency, inducing only transient Fe deficiency responses, which were characterized by a lack of induction of the ethylene pathway. Cadmium showed a rather inconsistent influence on Fe deficiency responses at multiple levels. By contrast, manganese evoked weak Fe deficiency responses in wild-type plants but strongly exacerbated chlorosis in <i>irt1</i> plants, indicating that manganese antagonized Fe mainly at the level of transport. These results show that the investigated heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s modulate Fe deficiency responses at different hierarchic and regulatory levels and that the interaction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s with physiological and morphological Fe deficiency responses is uncoupled. Thus, this study not only emphasizes the importance of assessing heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> toxicities at multiple levels but also provides a new perspective on how Fe deficiency contributes to the toxic action of individual heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s.</p>

Precipitation strengthening of aluminum alloys by room-temperature cyclic plasticity
<p>High-strength aluminum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s are important for lightweighting vehicles and are extensively used in aircraft and, increasingly, in automobiles. The highest-strength aluminum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s require a series of high-temperature “bakes” (120° to 200°C) to form a high number density of nanoparticles by solid-state precipitation. We found that a controlled, room-temperature cyclic deformation is sufficient to continuously inject vacancies into the material and to mediate the dynamic precipitation of a very fine (1- to 2-nanometer) distribution of solute clusters. This results in better material strength and elongation properties relative to traditional thermal treatments, despite a much shorter processing time. The microstructures formed are much more uniform than those characteristic of traditional thermal treatments and do not exhibit precipitate-free zones. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s are therefore likely to be more resistant to damage.</p>

Multicomponent intermetallic nanoparticles and superb mechanical behaviors of complex alloys
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> design based on single–principal-element systems has approached its limit for performance enhancements. A substantial increase in strength up to gigapascal levels typically causes the premature failure of materials with reduced ductility. Here, we report a strategy to break this trade-off by controllably introducing high-density ductile multicomponent inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic nanoparticles (MCINPs) in complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> systems. Distinct from the inter<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic-induced embrittlement under conventional wisdom, such MCINP-strengthened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s exhibit superior strengths of 1.5 gigapascals and ductility as high as 50% in tension at ambient temperature. The plastic instability, a major concern for high-strength materials, can be completely eliminated by generating a distinctive multistage work-hardening behavior, resulting from pronounced dislocation activities and deformation-induced microbands. This MCINP strategy offers a paradigm to develop next-generation materials for structural applications.</p>

Adaptive introgression underlies polymorphic seasonal camouflage in snowshoe hares
<p>Snowshoe hares (<i>Lepus americanus</i>) maintain seasonal camouflage by molting to a white winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>, but some hares remain brown during the winter in regions with low snow cover. We show that cis-regulatory variation controlling seasonal expression of the <i>Agouti</i> gene underlies this adaptive winter camouflage polymorphism. Genetic variation at <i>Agouti</i> clustered by winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> color across multiple hare and jackrabbit species, revealing a history of recurrent interspecific gene flow. Brown winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>s in snowshoe hares likely originated from an introgressed black-tailed jackrabbit allele that has swept to high frequency in mild winter environments. These discoveries show that introgression of genetic variants that underlie key ecological traits can seed past and ongoing adaptation to rapidly changing environments.</p>

Xylem Surfactants Introduce a New Element to the Cohesion-Tension Theory
<p>Vascular plants transport water under negative pressure without constantly creating gas bubbles that would disable their hydraulic systems. Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ing hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.</p>

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s become harder with decreasing grain sizes, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship. However, this relationship fails and softening occurs at some grain sizes in the nanometer regime for some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s. In this study, we discovered that plastic deformation mechanism of extremely fine nanograined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring grain boundary (GB) stability. The electrodeposited nanograined nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for grain sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB stabilization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh hardness is achieved in the nanograined samples with a plastic deformation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations. Grain boundary stability provides an alternative dimension, in addition to grain size, for producing novel nanograined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s with extraordinary properties.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> accumulation in seeds is a prerequisite for germination and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> transport processes and their interactions in seeds, we focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast transporter of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 transports Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe transport function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe transport. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjecting seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this transporter plays an important role in the generation of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> stores as well as for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

Aging and its modulation in a long-lived worker caste of the honey bee
<p>Highly social animals provide alternative aging models in which vastly different lifespan patterns are flexible, and linked to social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong>e. Research in these species aims to reveal how environment, including social cues, can shape the transition between short-lived and extremely long-lived phenotypes with negligible senescence. Among honey bee workers, short to intermediate lifespans are typical for summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong>es, while the winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong>e can live up to 10 times longer. For summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong>es, experimental interventions could predictably accelerate, slow or revert functional senescence. In contrast, little is known about the partic ular conditions under which periods of negligible senescence in winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cast</span></strong>es can be disrupted or sustained. We asked how manipulation of social environment in colonies with long-lived winter bees might alter the pace of functional senescence, measured as learning performance, as well as of cellular senescence, measured as lipofuscin accumulation. We show that behavioral senescence becomes rapidly detectable when the winter state is disrupted, and changes in social task behaviors and social environment (brood) are induced. Likewise, we found that cellular senescence was induced by such social intervention. However, cellular senescence showed marked regional differences, suggesting that particular brain regions age slower than others. Finally, by preventing post-winter colonies from brood rearing, behavioral senescence became undetectable, even after transition to the usually short-lived phenotypes had occurred. We envision that social regulation of negligible functional senescence and highly dynamic accumulation of a universal symptom of cellular aging (lipofuscin) offers rewarding perspectives to target proximate mechanisms of slowed aging.</p>

Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-insulator transition in correlated materials is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition. This coupling not only complicates the understanding of the basic mechanism of this phenomenon but also limits the speed and endurance of prospective electronic devices. We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-insulator transition in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal correlated material, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an interface interaction suppresses the electronic correlations without changing the crystal structure in this otherwise correlated insulator. This interaction stabilizes a nonequilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic phase and leads to an isostructural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-insulator transition. This discovery will provide insights into phase transitions of correlated materials and may aid the design of device functionalities.</p>

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy. Commercial single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s are usually synthesized by bulk crystal growth or by deposition of thin films onto substrates, and they are expensive and small. We prepared extremely large single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial polycrystalline foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane crystal orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the crystal lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Suppressing corrosion in primary aluminum–air batteries via oil displacement
<p>Primary aluminum–air batteries boast high theoretical energy densities, but negative electrode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion irreversibly limits their shelf life. Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion mitigation methods are insufficient or compromise power and energy density. We suppressed open-circuit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion by displacing electrolyte from the electrode surface with a nonconducting oil during battery standby. High power and energy density are enabled by displacing the oil with electrolyte for battery discharge. The underwater-oleophobic wetting properties of the designed cell surfaces allow for reversible oil displacement. We demonstrate this method in an aluminum–air cell that achieves a 420% increase in usable energy density and 99.99% reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corros</span></strong>ion, which lowers self-discharge to a rate of 0.02% a month and enables system energy densities of 700 watt-hours per liter and 900 watt-hours per kilogram.</p>

Insulator-metal transition in dense fluid deuterium
<p>Dense fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic hydrogen occupies the interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and many extrasolar planets, where pressures reach millions of atmospheres. Planetary structure models must describe accurately the transition from the outer molecular envelopes to the interior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic regions. We report optical measurements of dynamically compressed fluid deuterium to 600 gigapascals (GPa) that reveal an increasing refractive index, the onset of absorption of visible light near 150 GPa, and a transition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-like reflectivity (exceeding 30%) near 200 GPa, all at temperatures below 2000 kelvin.

Lectins modulate the microbiota of social amoebae
<p>The social amoeba <i>Dictyostelium discoideum</i> maintains a microbiome during multicellular development; bacteria are carried in migrating slugs and as endosymbionts within amoebae and spores. Bacterial carriage and endosymbiosis are induced by the secreted lectin discoidin I that binds bacteria, protects them from extracellular killing, and alters their retention within amoebae. This altered handling of bacteria also occurs with bacteria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed by plant lectins and leads to DNA transfer from bacteria to amoebae. Thus, lectins alter the cellular response of <i>D. discoideum</i> to bacteria to establish the amoebae’s microbiome. Mammalian cells can also maintain intracellular bacteria when presented with bacteria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed with lectins, so heterologous lectins may induce endosymbiosis in animals. Our results suggest that endogenous or environmental lectins may influence microbiome homeostasis across eukaryotic phylogeny.</p>

Probing the ultimate plasmon confinement limits with a van der Waals heterostructure
<p>The ability to confine light into tiny spatial dimensions is important for applications such as microscopy, sensing, and nanoscale lasers. Although plasmons offer an appealing avenue to confine light, Landau damping in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s imposes a trade-off between optical field confinement and losses. We show that a graphene-insulator-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> heterostructure can overcome that trade-off, and demonstrate plasmon confinement down to the ultimate limit of the length scale of one atom. This is achieved through far-field excitation of plasmon modes squeezed into an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride dielectric spacer between graphene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> rods. A theoretical model that takes into account the nonlocal optical response of both graphene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> is used to describe the results. These ultraconfined plasmonic modes, addressed with far-field light excitation, enable a route to new regimes of ultrastrong light-matter interactions.</p>

Winter color polymorphisms identify global hot spots for evolutionary rescue from climate change
<p>Maintenance of biodiversity in a rapidly changing climate will depend on the efficacy of evolutionary rescue, whereby population declines due to abrupt environmental change are reversed by shifts in genetically driven adaptive traits. However, a lack of traits known to be under direct selection by anthropogenic climate change has limited the incorporation of evolutionary processes into global conservation efforts. In 21 vertebrate species, some individuals undergo a seasonal color molt from summer brown to winter white as camouflage against snow, whereas other individuals remain brown. Seasonal snow duration is decreasing globally, and fitness is lower for winter white animals on snowless backgrounds. Based on 2713 georeferenced samples of known winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> color—from eight species across trophic levels—we identify environmentally driven clinal gradients in winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> color, including polymorphic zones where winter brown and white morphs co-occur. These polymorphic zones, underrepresented by existing global protected area networks, indicate hot spots for evolutionary rescue in a changing climate.</p>

Reducing the stochasticity of crystal nucleation to enable subnanosecond memory writing
<p>Operation speed is a key challenge in phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory. Commercialized PCRAM products are limited by the tens of nanoseconds writing speed, originating from the stochastic crystal nucleation during the crystallization of amorphous germanium antimony telluride<i> </i>(Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>). Here, we demonstrate an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>ing strategy to speed up the crystallization kinetics. The scandium antimony telluride (Sc<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) compound that we designed allows a writing speed of only 700 picoseconds without preprogramming in a large conventional PCRAM device. This ultrafast crystallization stems from the reduced stochasticity of nucleation through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize crystal precursors in the amorphous state. Controlling nucleation through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong> design paves the way for the development of cache-type PCRAM technology to boost the working efficiency of computing systems.</p>

Segregation-induced ordered superstructures at general grain boundaries in a nickel-bismuth alloy
<p>The properties of materials change, sometimes catastrophically, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>ing elements and impurities accumulate preferentially at grain boundaries. Studies of bicrystals show that regular atomic patterns often arise as a result of this solute segregation at high-symmetry boundaries, but it is not known whether superstructures exist at general grain boundaries in polycrystals. In bismuth-doped polycrystalline nickel, we found that ordered, segregation-induced grain boundary superstructures occur at randomly selected general grain boundaries, and that these reconstructions are driven by the orientation of the terminating grain surfaces rather than by lattice matching between grains. This discovery shows that adsorbate-induced superstructures are not limited to special grain boundaries but may exist at a variety of general grain boundaries, and hence they can affect the performance of polycrystalline engineering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloy</span></strong></span></strong>s.</p>

Tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices pinch collagen fibers to support 3D cell migration
<p>Migrating cells often use focal adhesions in order to move. Focal adhesions are less prominent in cells migrating in three-dimensional (3D) as compared with 2D environments. We looked for alternative adhesion structures supporting cell migration. We analyzed the dynamics of clathrin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed pits in cells migrating in a 3D environment of collagen fibers. Both topological cues and local engagement of integrins triggered the accumulation of clathrin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong>ed structures on fibers. Clathrin/adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) lattices pinched collagen fibers by adopting a tube-like morphology and regulated adhesion to fibers in an endocytosis-independent manner. During migration, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices stabilized cellular protrusions by providing anchoring points to collagen fibers. Thus, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices promote cell adhesion that, in coordination with focal adhesions, supports cell migration in 3D.</p>

3D Imaging of Tapetal Mitochondria Suggests the Importance of Mitochondrial Fission in Pollen Growth
<p>Mitochondrial fission occurs frequently in plant cells, but its biological significance is poorly understood because mutants specifically impaired in mitochondrial fission do not show obvious defects in vegetative growth. Here, we revealed that the production of viable pollen was reduced in mutants lacking one of the three main proteins involved in mitochondrial fission in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN3A (DRP3A)/Arabidopsis DYNAMIN-LIKE PROTEIN2A, DRP3B, and ELONGATED MITOCHONDRIA1 (ELM1). In <i>drp3b</i> and <i>elm1</i>, young microspores contained an abnormal number of nuclei, and mature pollen had aberrant accumulation of lipids in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> and an irregular pollen outer wall. Because the formation of the pollen wall and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> is mainly associated with tapetal function, we used 3D imaging to quantify geometric and textural features of cells and mitochondria in the tapetum at different stages, using isolated single tapetal cells in which the in vivo morphology and volume of cells and mitochondria were preserved. Tapetal cells and their mitochondria changed in the volume and morphology at different developmental stages. Defective mitochondrial fission in the <i>elm1</i> and <i>drp3b</i> mutants caused changes in mitochondrial status, including mitochondrial elongation, abnormal mitochondrial ultrastructure, a decrease in cross-sectional area, and a slight alteration of mitochondrial distribution, as well as a large reduction in mitochondrial density. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial fission is required for proper mitochondrial status in the tapetum and possibly in pollen as well and therefore plays an important role for the production of viable pollen.</p>

Awake1, an ABC-Type Transporter, Reveals an Essential Role for Suberin in the Control of Seed Dormancy
<p>The mother plant plays an important dynamic role in the control of dormancy of her progeny seed in response to environmental signals. In order to further understand the mechanisms by which this dormancy control takes place in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we conducted a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants that fail to enter dormancy in response to variation in temperature during seed set. We show that, for the first of these mutants, designated <i>awake1</i>, the maternal allele is required for entry into strongly dormant states and that <i>awake1</i> mutants show seed phenotypes shown previously to be associated with the loss of suberin in the seed. We identify <i>awake1</i> as an allele of <i>ABCG20</i>, an ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene required for the transport of fatty acids during suberin deposition, and show that further suberin-deficient mutants have seed dormancy defects. Seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> suberin composition is affected by temperature during seed maturation, but this response appears to be independent of ABCG20. We conclude that seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> suberin is essential for seed dormancy imposition by low temperature and that the exclusion of oxygen and water from the seed by the suberin and tannin layers is important for dormancy imposition.</p>

MONENSIN SENSITIVITY1 (MON1)/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-Mediated Rab7 Activation Regulates Tapetal Programmed Cell Death and Pollen Development
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD)-triggered degradation of plant tapetum is essential for microspore development and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> formation; however, little is known about the cellular mechanism regulating tapetal PCD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab7-mediated vacuolar transport of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases is crucial for tapetal PCD and pollen development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with the following evidence: (1) The <i>monensin sensitivity1</i> (<i>mon1</i>) mutants, which are defective in Rab7 activation, showed impaired male fertility due to a combined defect in both tapetum and male gametophyte development. (2) In anthers, <i>MON1</i> showed preferential high level expression in tapetal cell layers and pollen. (3) The <i>mon1</i> mutants exhibited delayed tapetum degeneration and tapetal PCD, resulting in abnormal pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coat</span></strong></span></strong> formation and decreased male fertility. (4) MON1/CALCIUM CAFFEINE ZINC SENSITIVITY1 (CCZ1)-mediated Rab7 activation was indispensable for vacuolar trafficking of tapetum degradation-related cysteine proteases, supporting that PCD-triggered tapetum degeneration requires Rab7-mediated vacuolar trafficking of these cysteine proteases. (5) <i>MON1</i> mutations also resulted in defective pollen germination and tube growth. Taken together, tapetal PCD and pollen development require successful MON1/CCZ1-mediated vacuolar transport in Arabidopsis.</p>

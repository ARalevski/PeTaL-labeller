Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, drought, and heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es, as well as their double and triple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-physiological acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Response patterns of differentially expressed genes, under single and combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es (i.e. common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> genes), were maintained only among 37% of the genes, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es. A comparison between common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> genes and genes that were uniquely expressed only under combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es (i.e. combination unique genes) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es and limited ability to predict plant responses as different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es are combined. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each gene subset was enriched with different biological processes. Common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> genes were enriched with known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response pathways, while combination unique-genes were enriched with unique processes and genes with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

The Arabidopsis DNA Methylome Is Stable under Transgenerational Drought Stress
<p>Improving the responsiveness, acclimation, and memory of plants to abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> holds substantive potential for improving agriculture. An unresolved question is the involvement of chromatin marks in the memory of agriculturally relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es. Such potential has spurred numerous investigations yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-induced DNA methylation variation can underpin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> memory. Using a slow-onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we investigated the malleability of the DNA methylome to drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> within a generation and under repeated drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> over five successive generations. While drought-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected within a generation, they did not correlate with drought-responsive gene expression. Six traits were analyzed for transgenerational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> memory, and the descendants of drought-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>ed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one generation removed from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. With respect to transgenerational drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, there were negligible conserved differentially methylated regions in drought-exposed lineages compared with un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>ed lineages. Instead, the majority of observed variation was tied to stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the experience of repeated drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> was not observed to influence transgenerational epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that, while transgenerational memory is observed in one of six traits examined, they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.</p>

Mental Stress–Induced-Myocardial Ischemia in Young Patients With Recent Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is frequent in patients with coronary artery disease and is associated with worse prognosis. Young women with a previous myocardial infarction (MI), a group with unexplained higher mortality than men of comparable age, have shown elevated rates of MSIMI, but the mechanisms are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied 306 patients (150 women and 156 men) ≤61 years of age who were hospitalized for MI in the previous 8 months and 112 community controls (58 women and 54 men) frequency matched for sex and age to the patients with MI. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and microvascular reactivity (reactive hyperemia index) were measured at rest and 30 minutes after mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. The digital vasomotor response to mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> was assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry. Patients received <sup>99m</sup>Tc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging at rest, with mental (speech task) and conventional (exercise/pharmacological) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age of the sample was 50 years (range, 22–61). In the MI group but not among controls, women had a more adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial profile than men. There were no sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors, and among patients with MI, clinical severity tended to be lower in women. Women in both groups showed a higher peripheral arterial tonometry ratio during mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> but a lower reactive hyperemia index after mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, indicating enhanced microvascular dysfunction after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. There were no sex differences in flow-mediated dilation changes with mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. The rate of MSIMI was twice as high in women as in men (22% versus 11%, <i>P</i>=0.009), and ischemia with conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> was similarly elevated (31% versus 16%, <i>P</i>=0.002). Psychosocial and clinical risk factors did not explain sex differences in inducible ischemia. Although vascular responses to mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> (peripheral arterial tonometry ratio and reactive hyperemia index) also did not explain sex differences in MSIMI, they were predictive of MSIMI in women only.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Young women after MI have a 2-fold likelihood of developing MSIMI compared with men and a similar increase in conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> ischemia. Microvascular dysfunction and peripheral vasoconstriction with mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> are implicated in MSIMI among women but not among men, perhaps reflecting women’s proclivity toward ischemia because of microcirculatory abnormalities.</p></sec>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Distinct Roles of Class I and II RPD3-Like Histone Deacetylases in Salinity Stress Response
<p>Histone acetylation is an essential process in the epigenetic regulation of diverse biological processes, including environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses in plants. Previously, our research group identified a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (HDI) that confers salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In this study, we demonstrate that class I HDAC (HDA19) and class II HDACs (HDA5/14/15/18) control responses to salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> through different pathways. The screening of 12 different selective HDIs indicated that seven newly reported HDIs enhance salt tolerance. Genetic analysis, based on a pharmacological study, identified which HDACs function in salinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance. In the wild-type Columbia-0 background, <i>hda19</i> plants exhibit tolerance to high-salinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, while <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants exhibit hypersensitivity to salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the effect of <i>HDA19</i> deficiency on the response to salinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> is distinct from that of <i>HDA5/14/15/18</i> deficiencies. In <i>hda19</i> plants, the expression levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance-related genes, late embryogenesis abundant proteins that prevent protein aggregation and positive regulators such as ABI5 and NAC019 in abscisic acid signaling, were induced strongly relative to the wild type. Neither of these elements was up-regulated in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants. The mutagenesis of HDA19 by genome editing in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting that suppression of HDA19 masks the phenotype caused by the suppression of class II HDACs in the salinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HDIs that inhibit class I HDACs allow the rescue of plants from salinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> regardless of their selectivity, and they provide insight into the hierarchal regulation of environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses through HDAC isoforms.</p>

Bioorthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) Enables Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein Synthesis in Native Plant Tissue
<p>Proteomic plasticity undergirds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses in plants, and understanding such responses requires accurate measurement of the extent to which proteins levels are adjusted to counter external stimuli. Here, we adapt bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to interrogate protein synthesis in vegetative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. BONCAT relies on the translational incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid probe into cellular proteins. In this study, the probe is the Met surrogate azidohomoalanine (Aha), which carries a reactive azide moiety in its amino acid side chain. The azide handle in Aha can be selectively conjugated to dyes and functionalized beads to enable visualization and enrichment of newly synthesized proteins. We show that BONCAT is sensitive enough to detect Arabidopsis proteins synthesized within a 30-min interval defined by an Aha pulse and that the method can be used to detect proteins made under conditions of light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, osmotic shock, salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, and recovery from heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. We further establish that BONCAT can be coupled to tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins synthesized during heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and recovery from heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Our results are consistent with a model in which, upon the onset of heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, translation is rapidly reprogrammed to enhance the synthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> mitigators and is again altered during recovery. All experiments were carried out with commercially available reagents, highlighting the accessibility of the BONCAT method to researchers interested in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses as well as translational and posttranslational regulation in plants.</p>

Cardiomyocyte glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors directly and antagonistically regulate heart disease in mice
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> is increasingly associated with heart dysfunction and is linked to higher mortality rates in patients with cardiometabolic disease. Glucocorticoids are primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> hormones that regulate homeostasis through two nuclear receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), both of which are present in cardiomyocytes. To examine the specific and coordinated roles that these receptors play in mediating the direct effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> on the heart, we generated mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of GR (cardioGRKO), MR (cardioMRKO), or both GR and MR (cardioGRMRdKO). The cardioGRKO mice spontaneously developed cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular systolic dysfunction and died prematurely from heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. In contrast, the cardioMRKO mice exhibited normal heart morphology and function. Despite the presence of myocardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, the cardioGRMRdKO mice were resistant to the cardiac remodeling, left ventricular dysfunction, and early death observed in the cardioGRKO mice. Gene expression analysis revealed the loss of gene changes associated with impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, increased oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, and enhanced cell death and the presence of gene changes that limited the hypertrophic response and promoted cardiomyocyte survival in the double knockout hearts. Reexpression of MR in cardioGRMRdKO hearts reversed many of the cardioprotective gene changes and resulted in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. These findings reveal a critical role for balanced cardiomyocyte GR and MR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signaling in cardiovascular health. Therapies that shift <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signaling in the heart to favor more GR and less MR activity may provide an improved approach for treating heart disease.</p>

Early life stress confers lifelong stress susceptibility in mice via ventral tegmental area OTX2
<p>Early life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> increases risk for depression. Here we establish a “two-hit” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> model in mice wherein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> at a specific postnatal period increases susceptibility to adult social defeat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and causes long-lasting transcriptional alterations that prime the ventral tegmental area (VTA)—a brain reward region—to be in a depression-like state. We identify a role for the developmental transcription factor orthodenticle homeobox 2 (<i>Otx2</i>) as an upstream mediator of these enduring effects. Transient juvenile—but not adult—knockdown of <i>Otx2</i> in VTA mimics early life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> by increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> susceptibility, whereas its overexpression reverses the effects of early life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. This work establishes a mechanism by which early life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> encodes lifelong susceptibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> via long-lasting transcriptional programming in VTA mediated by <i>Otx2</i>.</p>

STABILIZED1 Modulates Pre-mRNA Splicing for Thermotolerance
<p>High-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> often leads to differential RNA splicing, thus accumulating different types and/or amounts of mature mRNAs in eukaryotic cells. However, regulatory mechanisms underlying plant precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing in the environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> conditions remain elusive. Herein, we describe that a U5-snRNP-interacting protein homolog STABILIZED1 (STA1) has pre-mRNA splicing activity for heat-inducible transcripts including <i>HEAT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</i>s and various <i>HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN</i>s for the establishment of heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our cell-based splicing reporter assay demonstrated STA1 acts on pre-mRNA splicing for specific subsets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-related genes. Cellular reconstitution of heat-inducible transcription cascades supported the view that STA1-dependent pre-mRNA splicing plays a role in DREB2A-dependent <i>HSFA3</i> expression for heat-responsive gene expression. Further genetic analysis with a loss-of-function mutant <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in Col background, and <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background verified that STA1 is essential in expression of necessary genes including <i>HSFA3</i> for two-step heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in plants. However, constitutive overexpression of the cDNA version of <i>HSFA3</i> in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background is unable to execute plant heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>. Consistently our global target analysis of STA1 showed that its splicing activity modulates a rather broad range of gene expression in response to heat treatment. The findings of this study reveal that heat-inducible STA1 activity for pre-mRNA splicing serves as a molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance to high-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Enhances Al-Induced Root Growth Inhibition<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Phytohormones such as ethylene and auxin are involved in the regulation of the aluminum (Al)-induced root growth inhibition. Although jasmonate (JA) has been reported to play a crucial role in the regulation of root growth and development in response to environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es through interplay with ethylene and auxin, its role in the regulation of root growth response to Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> is not yet known. In an attempt to elucidate the role of JA, we found that exogenous application of JA enhanced the Al-induced root growth inhibition. Furthermore, phenotype analysis with mutants defective in either JA biosynthesis or signaling suggests that JA is involved in the regulation of Al-induced root growth inhibition. The expression of the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1) and the key JA signaling regulator MYC2 was up-regulated in response to Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> in the root tips. This process together with COI1-mediated Al-induced root growth inhibition under Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> was controlled by ethylene but not auxin. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many responsive genes under Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> were regulated by JA signaling. The differential responsive of microtubule organization-related genes between the wild-type and <i>coi1-2</i> mutant is consistent with the changed depolymerization of cortical microtubules in <i>coi1</i> under Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. In addition, ALMT-mediated malate exudation and thus Al exclusion from roots in response to Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> was also regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling. Together, this study suggests that root growth inhibition is regulated by COI1-mediated JA signaling independent from auxin signaling and provides novel insights into the phytohormone-mediated root growth inhibition in response to Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.</p>

Reversible Leaf Xylem Collapse: A Potential “Circuit Breaker” against Cavitation
<p>We report a novel form of xylem dysfunction in angiosperms: reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collaps</span></strong>e of the xylem conduits of the smallest vein orders that demarcate and intrusively irrigate the areoles of red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy revealed gradual increases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collaps</span></strong>e from approximately −2 MPa down to −3 MPa, saturating thereafter (to −4 MPa). Over this range, cavitation remained negligible in these veins. Imaging of rehydration experiments showed spatially variable recovery from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collaps</span></strong>e within 20 s and complete recovery after 2 min. More broadly, the patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation induced by desiccation in both mesophyll and xylem suggest that cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collaps</span></strong>e is unlikely to depend solely on individual wall properties, as mechanical constraints imposed by neighbors appear to be important. From the perspective of equilibrium leaf water potentials, petioles, whose vessels extend into the major veins, showed a vulnerability to cavitation that overlapped in the water potential domain with both minor vein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collaps</span></strong>e and buckling (turgor loss) of the living cells. However, models of transpiration transients showed that minor vein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collaps</span></strong>e and mesophyll capacitance could effectively buffer major veins from cavitation over time scales relevant to the rectification of stomatal wrong-way responses. We suggest that, for angiosperms, whose subsidiary cells give up large volumes to allow large stomatal apertures at the cost of potentially large wrong-way responses, vein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collaps</span></strong>e could make an important contribution to these plants’ ability to transpire near the brink of cavitation-inducing water potentials.</p>

Males exhibit competitive advantages over females of <i>Populus deltoides</i> under salinity stress
<p>Sexual competition among dioecious plants affects sex ratios and the spatial distribution of the sexes in different environments. At present, little is known about sexual dimorphisms induced by different competition patterns under salinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. We employed <i>Populus deltoides</i> as a model to investigate sex-related growth as well as physiological and biochemical responses to salinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> under conditions of intrasexual and intersexual competition. Potted seedlings (two seedlings per pot; two females, two males, or one female and one male) were exposed to two salt levels (0 and 50 mM NaCl) and salinity- and competition-driven differences in growth, assimilation rate, water use, contents of leaf pigments and osmotica, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and antioxidant enzyme and nitrate reductase activity were examined. In the absence of salinity, no significant differences in competitive ability between males and females subjected to intrasexual competition were observed, although the growth of females was moderately greater under intersexual competition. The salinity treatment significantly increased the sex differences in competitive ability, especially under intersexual competition. Under salinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, males showed decreased height, but displayed greater capacity for osmotic adjustment, enhancement of long-term water-use efficiency and increase in antioxidant enzyme activities. The absolute values of these traits were greater in salt-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>ed males than in females under intersexual competition. In addition, salt-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>ed males accumulated less Cl<sup>−</sup> and had lower H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents than females. These data collectively demonstrate that the competitive advantage of females in non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>ed conditions is lost under salinity. Greater salinity resistance of males growing intermixed with females under salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> can importantly affect the sex ratio of <i>P. deltoides</i> populations.</p>

E-C coupling structural protein junctophilin-2 encodes a stress-adaptive transcription regulator
<p>Junctophilin-2 (JP2) is a structural protein required for normal excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. After cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, JP2 is cleaved by the calcium ion–dependent protease calpain, which disrupts the E-C coupling ultrastructural machinery and drives heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e progression. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-induced proteolysis of JP2 liberates an N-terminal fragment (JP2NT) that translocates to the nucleus, binds to genomic DNA, and controls expression of a spectrum of genes in cardiomyocytes. Transgenic overexpression of JP2NT in mice modifies the transcriptional profile, resulting in attenuated pathological remodeling in response to cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Conversely, loss of nuclear JP2NT function accelerates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-induced development of hypertrophy and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in mutant mice. These data reveal a self-protective mechanism in failing cardiomyocytes that transduce mechanical information (E-C uncoupling) into salutary transcriptional reprogramming in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>ed heart.</p>

Extraordinary plasticity of an inorganic semiconductor in darkness
<p>Inorganic semiconductors generally tend to fail in a brittle manner. Here, we report that extraordinary “plasticity” can take place in an inorganic semiconductor if the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation is carried out “in complete darkness.” Room-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation tests of zinc sulfide (ZnS) were performed under varying light conditions. ZnS crystals immediately fractured when they <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed under light irradiation. In contrast, it was found that ZnS crystals can be plastically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed up to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation strain of ε<sub>t</sub> = 45% in complete darkness. In addition, the optical bandgap of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed ZnS crystals was distinctly decreased after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation. These results suggest that dislocations in ZnS become mobile in complete darkness and that multiplied dislocations can affect the optical bandgap over the whole crystal. Inorganic semiconductors are not necessarily intrinsically brittle.</p>

A Functional Unfolded Protein Response Is Required for Normal Vegetative Development
<p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in plants in response to endoplasmic reticulum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and plays an important role in mitigating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> damage. Multiple factors act in the UPR, including the membrane-associated transcription factor, BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER 17 (bZIP17), and the membrane-associated RNA splicing factor, INOSITOL REQUIRING ENZYME1 (IRE1). We have analyzed an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>ire1a ire1b bzip17</i> triple mutant, with defects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signaling, and found that the mutant is also impaired in vegetative plant growth under conditions without externally applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. This raised the possibility that the UPR functions in plant development in the same manner as it does in responding to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. bZIP17 is mobilized to the nucleus in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, and through the analysis of a mobilization-defective bZIP17 mutant, we found that to support normal plant development bZIP17 must be capable of mobilization. Likewise, through the analysis of <i>ire1</i> mutants defective in either protein kinase or RNase activities, we found that both must be operative to promote normal development. These findings demonstrate that the UPR, which is associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses in plants, also functions under un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>ed conditions to support normal development.</p>

Auxin Efflux Carrier ZmPGP1 Mediates Root Growth Inhibition under Aluminum Stress
<p>Auxin has been shown to enhance root growth inhibition under aluminum (Al) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), auxin may play a negative role in the Al-induced inhibition of root growth. In this study, we identified mutants deficient in the maize auxin efflux carrier P-glycoprotein (ZmPGP1) after ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and used them to elucidate the contribution of ZmPGP1 to Al-induced root growth inhibition. Root growth in the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutant, which forms shortened roots and is hyposensitive to auxin, was less inhibited by Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> than that in the inbred line B73. In the <i>zmpgp1</i> mutants, the root tips displayed higher auxin accumulation and enhanced auxin signaling under Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, which was also consistent with the increased expression of auxin-responsive genes. Based on the behavior of the auxin-responsive marker transgene, <i>DR5rev:RFP</i>, we concluded that Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> reduced the level of auxin in the root tip, which contrasts with the tendency of Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-induced Arabidopsis plants to accumulate more auxin in their root tips. In addition, Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> induced the expression of <i>ZmPGP1</i>. Therefore, in maize, Al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> is associated with reduced auxin accumulation in root tips, a process that is regulated by ZmPGP1 and thus causes inhibition of root growth. This study provides further evidence about the role of auxin and auxin polar transport in Al-induced root growth regulation in maize.</p>

3′-Phosphoadenosine 5′-Phosphate Accumulation Delays the Circadian System
<p>The circadian system optimizes cellular responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, but the signaling pathways that convey the metabolic consequences of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> into this molecular timekeeping mechanism remain unclear. Redox regulation of the SAL1 phosphatase during abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> initiates a signaling pathway from chloroplast to nucleus by regulating the accumulation of a metabolite, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP). Consequently, PAP accumulates in response to redox <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and inhibits the activity of exoribonucleases (XRNs) in the nucleus and cytosol. We demonstrated that osmotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> induces a lengthening of circadian period and that genetically inducing the SAL1-PAP-XRN pathway in plants lacking either SAL1 or XRNs similarly delays the circadian system. Exogenous application of PAP was also sufficient to extend circadian period. Thus, SAL1-PAP-XRN signaling likely regulates circadian rhythms in response to redox <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Our findings exemplify how two central processes in plants, molecular timekeeping and responses to abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, can be interlinked to regulate gene expression.</p>

Ethylene Signaling Modulates Cortical Microtubule Reassembly in Response to Salt Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Regulation of cortical microtubule reorganization is essential for plant cell survival under high salinity conditions. In response to salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, microtubules undergo rapid depolymerization followed by reassembly to form a new microtubule network that promotes cell survival; however, the upstream regulatory mechanisms for this recovery response are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that ethylene signaling facilitates salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-induced reassembly of cortical microtubules in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Microtubule depolymerization was not affected under salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> following the suppression of ethylene signaling with Ag<sup>+</sup> or in ethylene-insensitive mutants, whereas microtubule reassembly was significantly inhibited. ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3, a key transcription factor in the ethylene signaling pathway, was shown to play a central role in microtubule reassembly under salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. In addition, we performed functional characterization of the microtubule-stabilizing protein WAVE-DAMPENED2-LIKE5 (WDL5), which was found to promote ethylene-associated microtubule reassembly and plant salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance. These findings indicate that ethylene signaling regulates microtubule reassembly by up-regulating <i>WDL5</i> expression in response to salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, thereby implicating ethylene signaling in salt-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in plants.</p>

A Nucleus-Localized Long Non-Coding RNA Enhances Drought and Salt Stress Tolerance
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene expression through a wide range of mechanisms and are considered as important regulators in many essential biological processes. A large number of lncRNA transcripts have been predicted or identified in plants in recent years. However, the biological functions for most of them are still unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lncRNA, <i>DROUGHT INDUCED lncRNA</i> (<i>DRIR</i>), as a novel positive regulator of the plant response to drought and salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. <i>DRIR</i> was expressed at a low level under non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> conditions but can be significantly activated by drought and salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. We identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i>, which had higher expression of the <i>DRIR</i> gene than the wild-type plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant exhibits increased tolerance to drought and salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Overexpressing <i>DRIR</i> in Arabidopsis also increased tolerance to drought and salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> of the transgenic plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant and the overexpressing seedlings are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in stomata closure and seedling growth. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the expression of a large number of genes was altered in <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> and the overexpressing plants. These include genes involved in ABA signaling, water transport, and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-relief processes. Our study reveals a mechanism whereby <i>DRIR</i> regulates the plant response to abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> by modulating the expression of a series of genes involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response.</p>

A Histone Code Reader and a Transcriptional Activator Interact to Regulate Genes for Salt Tolerance
<p>Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins are involved in various developmental processes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses. They recognize and bind to epigenetically modified histone H3 tail and function as histone code readers. Here we report that GmPHD6 reads low methylated histone H3K4me0/1/2 but not H3K4me3 with its N-terminal domain instead of the PHD finger. GmPHD6 does not possess transcriptional regulatory ability but has DNA-binding ability. Through the PHD finger, GmPHD6 interacts with its coactivator, LHP1-1/2, to form a transcriptional activation complex. Using a transgenic hairy root system, we demonstrate that overexpression of <i>GmPHD6</i> improves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in soybean (<i>Glycine</i> <i>max</i>) plants. Knocking down the <i>LHP1</i> expression disrupts this role of <i>GmPHD6</i>, indicating that GmPHD6 requires LHP1 functions during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response. GmPHD6 influences expression of dozens of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-related genes. Among these, we identified three targets of GmPHD6, including ABA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-ripening-induced <i>CYP75B1</i> and <i>CYP82C4</i>. Overexpression of each gene confers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in soybean plants. GmPHD6 is recruited to H3K4me0/1/2 marks and recognizes the G-rich elements in target gene promoters, whereas LHP1 activates expression of these targets. Our study reveals a mechanism involving two partners in a complex. Manipulation of the genes in this pathway should improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in soybean or other legumes/crops.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems perform the crucial task of absorbing water from the soil to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that drought-induced mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine root cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine root hydraulic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> was embolism formation observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the fine roots (50% loss of hydraulic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine roots function like hydraulic fuses that decouple plants from drying soil, thus preserving the hydraulic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine root mortality and turnover under drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.</p>

Nicotinamide Riboside Preserves Cardiac Function in a Mouse Model of Dilated Cardiomyopathy

As the major coenzyme in fuel oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and a substrate for enzymes signaling energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is emerging as a metabolic target in a number of diseases including heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Little is known on the mechanisms regulating homeostasis of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the failing heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To explore possible alterations of NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in the failing heart, we quantified the expression of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes in the human failing heart and in the heart of a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) triggered by Serum Response Factor transcription factor depletion in the heart (SRF<sup>HKO</sup>) or of cardiac hypertrophy triggered by transverse aorta constriction. We studied the impact of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor supplementation on cardiac function in both mouse models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed a 30% loss in levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the murine failing heart of both DCM and transverse aorta constriction mice that was accompanied by a decrease in expression of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme that recycles the nicotinamide precursor, whereas the nicotinamide riboside kinase 2 (NMRK2) that phosphorylates the nicotinamide riboside precursor is increased, to a higher level in the DCM (40-fold) than in transverse aorta constriction (4-fold). This shift was also observed in human failing heart biopsies in comparison with nonfailing controls. We show that the <i>Nmrk2</i> gene is an AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α responsive gene that is activated by energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Nicotinamide riboside efficiently rescues NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis in response to FK866-mediated inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and stimulates glycolysis in cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, we show that nicotinamide riboside supplementation in food attenuates the development of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in mice, more robustly in DCM, and partially after transverse aorta constriction, by stabilizing myocardial NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the failing heart. Nicotinamide riboside treatment also robustly increases the myocardial levels of 3 metabolites, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, methylnicotinamide, and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, that can be used as validation biomarkers for the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data show that nicotinamide riboside, the most energy-efficient among NAD precursors, could be useful for treatment of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e, notably in the context of DCM, a disease with few therapeutic options.</p></sec>

However, the device consists of the pump, driveline, and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Prospectively collected data were reviewed for all LVAD device malfunctions (DMs) occurring in rotary LVADs implanted at a single center between April 2004 and May 2016. Durable LVADs included 108 Heartmate II (HM II) and 105 HeartWare VAD (HVAD). DM data were categorized according to device type and into categories related to the component that failed: (1) controller, (2) peripheral components, and (3) implantable blood pump or its integral electric driveline. Pump-related events were analyzed as pump-specific (suspected or confirmed thrombosis) or nonpump-specific (driveline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e). DM rates were reported as events per 1000 patient-days, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses. Cumulative rates of malfunction were examined for the main components of each type of LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Types of DM included controller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (30%), battery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (19%), or patient cable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e (14%), whereas only 13% were because of pump <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. DMs were more common in the HM II device (3.73 per 1000 patient-days versus 3.06 per 1000 patient-days for the HVAD, <i>P</i><0.01). A higher rate of pump-specific malfunctions was discovered in those implanted with an HM II versus an HVAD (0.55 versus 0.39, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01) and peripheral malfunctions (2.32 versus 1.78 for the HM II and HVAD, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01); no difference occurred in the incidence of controller DM between the 2 LVADs. Patients with HVAD were 90% free of a pump-specific malfunction at 3 years compared with 56% for the HM II (log-rank <i>P</i><0.003). Only 74% of the patients with HM II were free of pump thrombosis at 3 years compared with 90% of the patients with HVAD. Freedom from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e of the integrated driveline was 79% at 3 years for the HM II but 100% for the HVAD (log-rank <i>P</i><0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Device malfunction is much broader than pump <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e alone and occurs for different components at different rates based on the type of LVAD.</p></sec>

Age-Specific Trends in Incidence, Mortality, and Comorbidities of Heart Failure in Denmark, 1995 to 2012
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The cumulative burden and importance of cardiovascular risk factors have changed over the past decades. Specifically, obesity rates have increased among younger people, whereas cardiovascular health has improved in the elderly. Little is known regarding how these changes have impacted the incidence and the mortality rates of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the age-specific trends in the incidence and 1-year mortality rates following a first-time diagnosis of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e in Denmark between 1995 and 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included all Danish individuals >18 years of age with a first-time in-hospital diagnosis of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e. Data were collected from 3 nationwide Danish registries. Annual incidence rates of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e and 1-year standardized mortality rates were calculated under the assumption of a Poisson distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 210 430 individuals with a first-time diagnosis of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e between 1995 and 2012; the annual incidence rates per 10 000 person-years declined among older individuals (rates in 1995 versus 2012: 164 versus 115 in individuals >74 years, 63 versus 35 in individuals 65–74 years, and 20 versus 17 in individuals 55–64 years; <i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but increased among the younger (0.4 versus 0.7 in individuals 18–34 years, 1.3 versus 2.0 in individuals 35–44 years, and 5.0 versus 6.4 in individuals 45–54 years; <i>P</i><0.0001 for all). The proportion of patients with incident heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e ≤50 years of age doubled from 3% in 1995 to 6% in 2012 (<i>P</i><0.0001).

Retrieval practice protects memory against acute stress
<p>More than a decade of research has supported a robust consensus: Acute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> impairs memory retrieval. We aimed to determine whether a highly effective learning technique could strengthen memory against the negative effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. To bolster memory, we used retrieval practice, or the act of taking practice tests. Participants first learned stimuli by either restudying or engaging in retrieval practice. Twenty-four hours later, we induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> in half of the participants and assessed subsequent memory performance. Participants who learned by restudying demonstrated the typical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-related memory impairment, whereas those who learned by retrieval practice were immune to the deleterious effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. These results suggest that the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> on memory retrieval may be contingent on the strength of the memory representations themselves.</p>

A Critical Role of Sodium Flux via the Plasma Membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Exchanger SOS1 in the Salt Tolerance of Rice
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) stands among the world's most important crop species. Rice is salt sensitive, and the undue accumulation of sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) in shoots has the strongest negative correlation with rice productivity under long-term salinity. The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger protein Salt Overly Sensitive 1 (SOS1) is the sole Na<sup>+</sup> efflux transporter that has been genetically characterized to date. Here, the importance of SOS1-facilitated Na<sup>+</sup> flux in the salt tolerance of rice was analyzed in a reverse-genetics approach. A <i>sos1</i> loss-of-function mutant displayed exceptional salt sensitivity that was correlated with excessive Na<sup>+</sup> intake and impaired Na<sup>+</sup> loading into the xylem, thus indicating that SOS1 controls net root Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and long-distance Na<sup>+</sup> transport to shoots. The acute Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of <i>sos1</i> plants at low NaCl concentrations allowed analysis of the transcriptional response to sodicity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> without effects of the osmotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> intrinsic to high-salinity treatments. In contrast with that in the wild type, <i>sos1</i> mutant roots displayed preferential down-regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-related genes in response to salt treatment, despite the greater intensity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> experienced by the mutant. These results suggest there is impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> detection or an inability to mount a comprehensive response to salinity in <i>sos1</i>. In summary, the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger SOS1 plays a major role in the salt tolerance of rice by controlling Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and possibly contributing to the sensing of sodicity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.</p>

The Tomato Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase SlMPK1 Is as a Negative Regulator of the High-Temperature Stress Response
<p>High-temperature (HT) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> is a major environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> that limits plant growth and development. MAPK cascades play key roles in plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signaling, but their involvement in the HT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 47-kD MBP-phosphorylated protein (p47-MBPK) activated in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves under HT and identify it as SlMPK1 by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of <i>SlMPK1</i> in transgenic tomato plants resulted in enhanced tolerance to HT, while overexpression resulted in reduced tolerance. Proteomic analysis identified a set of proteins involved in antioxidant defense that are significantly more abundant in RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants than nontransgenic plants under HT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants also showed changes in membrane lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a serine-proline-rich protein homolog, SlSPRH1, which interacts with SlMPK1 in yeast, in plant cells, and in vitro. We demonstrate that SlMPK1 can directly phosphorylate SlSPRH1. Furthermore, the serine residue serine-44 of SlSPRH1 is a crucial phosphorylation site in the SlMPK1-mediated antioxidant defense mechanism activated during HT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. We also demonstrate that heterologous expression of <i>SlSPRH1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) led to a decrease in thermotolerance and lower antioxidant capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that SlMPK1 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance in tomato plants. SlMPK1 acts by regulating antioxidant defense, and its substrate SlSPRH1 is involved in this pathway.</p>

Novel Stress-Inducible Antisense RNAs of Protein-Coding Loci Are Synthesized by RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase
<p>Our previous study identified approximately 6,000 abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-responsive noncoding transcripts existing on the antisense strand of protein-coding genes and implied that a type of antisense RNA was synthesized from a sense RNA template by <i>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</i> (<i>RDR</i>). Expression analyses revealed that the expression of novel abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-induced antisense RNA on 1,136 gene loci was reduced in the <i>rdr1/2/6</i> mutants. RNase protection indicated that the <i>RD29A</i> antisense RNA and other RDR1/2/6-dependent antisense RNAs are involved in the formation of dsRNA. The accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-inducible antisense RNA was decreased and increased in <i>dcp5</i> and <i>xrn4</i>, respectively, but not changed in <i>dcl2/3/4</i>, <i>nrpd1a</i> and <i>nrpd1b</i>. RNA-seq analyses revealed that the majority of the RDR1/2/6-dependent antisense RNA loci did not overlap with RDR1/2/6-dependent 20–30 nt RNA loci. Additionally, <i>rdr1/2/6</i> mutants decreased the degradation rate of the sense RNA and exhibited arrested root growth during the recovery stage following a drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, whereas <i>dcl2/3/4</i> mutants did not. Collectively, these results indicate that RDRs have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-inducible antisense RNA synthesis activity and a novel biological function that is different from the known endogenous small RNA pathways from protein-coding genes. These data reveal a novel mechanism of RNA regulation during abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response that involves complex RNA degradation pathways.</p>

The Pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 Sustains Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis as a Function of Heat Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants sense temperature changes and respond by altering growth and metabolic activity to acclimate to the altered environmental conditions. The B vitamins give rise to vital coenzymes that are indispensable for growth and development but their inherent reactive nature renders them prone to destruction especially under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> conditions. Therefore, plant survival strategies would be expected to include mechanisms to sustain B vitamin supply under demanding circumstances. Here, using the example of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, we investigate the regulation of biosynthesis across eudicot and monocot species under heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Most eudicots carry a pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 that is a noncatalytic homolog of the PDX1 subunit of the vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis protein machinery, PYRIDOXINE BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN1. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) as models, we show that <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> is transcriptionally regulated by the HSFA1 transcription factor family. Monocots only carry catalytic <i>PDX1</i> homologs that do not respond to heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> as demonstrated for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis across the two lineages. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> transcription reveals two alternative transcriptional start sites, one of which is exclusive to heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Further data suggest that PDX1.2 leads to stabilization of the catalytic PDX1s under heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> conditions, which would serve to maintain vitamin B<sub>6</sub> homeostasis in times of need in eudicots that carry this gene. Our analyses indicate an important abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance strategy in several eudicots, which has not been evolutionarily adapted (or is not required) by monocots such as grasses.</p>

Function of the Plant DNA Polymerase Epsilon in Replicative Stress Sensing, a Genetic Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Faithful transmission of the genetic information is essential in all living organisms. DNA replication is therefore a critical step of cell proliferation, because of the potential occurrence of replication errors or DNA damage when progression of a replication fork is hampered causing replicative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Like other types of DNA damage, replicative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> activates the DNA damage response, a signaling cascade allowing cell cycle arrest and repair of lesions. The replicative DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) was shown to activate the S-phase checkpoint in yeast in response to replicative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, but whether this mechanism functions in multicellular eukaryotes remains unclear. Here, we explored the genetic interaction between Pol ε and the main elements of the DNA damage response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We found that mutations affecting the polymerase domain of Pol ε trigger ATR-dependent signaling leading to SOG1 activation, WEE1-dependent cell cycle inhibition, and tolerance to replicative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> induced by hydroxyurea, but result in enhanced sensitivity to a wide range of DNA damaging agents. Using knock-down lines, we also provide evidence for the direct role of Pol ε in replicative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> sensing. Together, our results demonstrate that the role of Pol ε in replicative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> sensing is conserved in plants, and provide, to our knowledge, the first genetic dissection of the downstream signaling events in a multicellular eukaryote.</p>

The Transcription Factor MYB29 Is a Regulator of <i>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1a</i>
<p>Plants sense and integrate a variety of signals from the environment through different interacting signal transduction pathways that involve hormones and signaling molecules. Using <i>ALTERNATIVE OXIDASE1a</i> (<i>AOX1a</i>) gene expression as a model system of retrograde or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signaling between mitochondria and the nucleus, MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN29 (MYB29) was identified as a negative regulator (<i>regulator of alternative oxidase1a 7</i> [<i>rao7</i>] mutant) in a genetic screen of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>rao7/myb29</i> mutants have increased levels of AOX1a transcript and protein compared to wild type after induction with antimycin A. A variety of genes previously associated with the mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response also display enhanced transcript abundance, indicating that RAO7/MYB29 negatively regulates mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses in general. Meta-analysis of hormone-responsive marker genes and identification of downstream transcription factor networks revealed that MYB29 functions in the complex interplay of ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and reactive oxygen species signaling by regulating the expression of various ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR and WRKY transcription factors. Despite an enhanced induction of mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response genes, <i>rao7</i>/<i>myb29</i> mutants displayed an increased sensitivity to combined moderate light and drought <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. These results uncover interactions between mitochondrial retrograde signaling and the regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis, both regulated by RAO7/MYB29. This common regulator can explain why perturbation of the mitochondrial function leads to transcriptomic responses overlapping with responses to biotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.</p>

Type 5 Adenylyl Cyclase Increases Oxidative Stress by Transcriptional Regulation of Manganese Superoxide Dismutase via the SIRT1/FoxO3a Pathway
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>For reasons that remain unclear, whether type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5), 1 of 2 major AC isoforms in heart, is protective or deleterious in response to cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> is controversial. To reconcile this controversy we examined the cardiomyopathy induced by chronic isoproterenol in AC5 transgenic (Tg) mice and the signaling mechanisms involved.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Chronic isoproterenol increased oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and induced more severe cardiomyopathy in AC5 Tg, as left ventricular ejection fraction fell 1.9-fold more than wild type, along with greater left ventricular dilation and increased fibrosis, apoptosis, and hypertrophy. Oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> induced by chronic isoproterenol, detected by 8-OhDG was 15% greater, <i>P</i>=0.007, in AC5 Tg hearts, whereas protein expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) was reduced by 38%, indicating that the susceptibility of AC5 Tg to cardiomyopathy may be attributable to decreased MnSOD expression. Consistent with this, susceptibility of the AC5 Tg to cardiomyopathy was suppressed by overexpression of MnSOD, whereas protection afforded by the AC5 knockout (KO) was lost in AC5 KO×MnSOD heterozyous KO mice. Elevation of MnSOD was eliminated by both sirtuin and MEK inhibitors, suggesting both the SIRT1/FoxO3a and MEK/ERK pathway are involved in MnSOD regulation by AC5.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Overexpression of AC5 exacerbates the cardiomyopathy induced by chronic catecholamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> by altering regulation of SIRT1/FoxO3a, MEK/ERK, and MnSOD, resulting in oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> intolerance, thereby shedding light on new approaches for treatment of heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">failur</span></strong>e.</p></sec>

BpNAC012 Positively Regulates Abiotic Stress Responses and Secondary Wall Biosynthesis
<p>NAC (NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2) transcription factors play important roles in plant biological processes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses. Here, we characterized the functional roles of BpNAC012 in white birch (<i>Betula platyphylla</i>). We found that BpNAC012 serves as a transcriptional activator. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses revealed that the transcript level of <i>BpNAC012</i> was positively associated with salt and osmotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance. BpNAC012 activated the core sequence CGT[G/A] to induce the expression of abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-responsive downstream genes, including Δ-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase, superoxide dismutase, and peroxidase, resulting in enhanced salt and osmotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance in <i>BpNAC012</i> overexpression transgenic birch lines. We also showed that <i>BpNAC012</i> is expressed predominantly in mature stems and that RNA interference-induced suppression of <i>BpNAC012</i> caused a drastic reduction in the secondary wall thickening of stem fibers. Overexpression of <i>BpNAC012</i> activated the expression of secondary wall-associated downstream genes by directly binding to the secondary wall NAC-binding element sites, resulting in ectopic secondary wall deposition in the stem epidermis. Moreover, salt and osmotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>es elicited higher expression levels of lignin biosynthetic genes and elevated lignin accumulation in <i>BpNAC012</i> overexpression lines. These findings provide insight into the functions of NAC transcription factors.</p>

Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> acclimation in a process termed systemic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in systemic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the systemic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the systemic response as well as in supporting the generation of different systemic signals. Here, we report that local application of light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, systemic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the systemic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the systemically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, systemic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> that propagates from the local to the systemic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and systemic tissues play an important role in systemic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid systemic response of plants to light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>.</p>

SENSITIVE TO SALT1, An Endoplasmic Reticulum-Localized Chaperone, Positively Regulates Salt Resistance
<p>Salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> seriously affects plant growth and development. Through genetic screening, we identified and characterized an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>sensitive to salt1</i> (<i>ses1</i>) mutant. <i>SES1</i> was ubiquitously expressed and induced by salt treatment. The salt-sensitive phenotype of <i>ses1</i> was due neither to the overaccumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> nor to the suppression of salt tolerance-associated genes. <i>SES1</i> encoded an uncharacterized endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized protein. Coinciding with its subcellular distribution, <i>ses1</i> exhibited overactivation of unfolded protein response genes and was largely influenced by severe ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Biochemical evidence revealed that SES1 functions as an important molecular chaperone to alleviate salt-induced ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Furthermore, the ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> sensor basic leucine zipper factor17 transactivated <i>SES1</i> by binding directly to its promoter region.

Specialized Plastids Trigger Tissue-Specific Signaling for Systemic Stress Response in Plants
<p>Plastids comprise a complex set of organelles in plants that can undergo distinctive patterns of differentiation and redifferentiation during their lifespan. Plastids localized to the epidermis and vascular parenchyma are distinctive in size, structural features, and functions. These plastids are termed “sensory” plastids, and here we show their proteome to be distinct from chloroplasts, with specialized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-associated features. The distinctive sensory plastid proteome in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) derives from spatiotemporal regulation of nuclear genes encoding plastid-targeted proteins. Perturbation caused by depletion of the sensory plastid-specific protein MutS HOMOLOG1 conditioned local, programmed changes in gene networks controlling chromatin, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-related phytohormone, and circadian clock behavior and producing a global, systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response in the plant. We posit that the sensory plastid participates in sensing environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, integrating this sensory function with epigenetic and gene expression circuitry to condition heritable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> memory.</p>

INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 Recruits Histone Deacetylase and a Transcriptional Repression Complex to Regulate Rice Salt Tolerance
<p>Perception and transduction of salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signals are critical for plant survival, growth, and propagation. Thus, identification of components of the salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-signaling pathway is important for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) molecular breeding of salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> resistance. Here, we report the identification of an apetala2/ethylene response factor transcription factor INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 (IDS1) and its roles in the regulation of rice salt tolerance. By genetic screening and phenotype analysis, we demonstrated that IDS1 conferred transcriptional repression activity and acted as a negative regulator of salt tolerance in rice. To identify potential downstream target genes regulated by IDS1, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing and ChIP-quantitative PCR assays and found that IDS1 may directly associate with the GCC-box-containing motifs in the promoter regions of abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-responsive genes, including <i>LEA1</i> (<i>LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEIN1</i>) and <i>SOS1</i> (<i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i>), which are key genes regulating rice salt tolerance. IDS1 physically interacted with the transcriptional corepressor topless-related 1 and the histone deacetylase HDA1, contributing to the repression of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> expression. Analyses of histone H3 acetylation status and RNA polymerase II occupation on the promoters of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> further defined the molecular foundation of the transcriptional repression activity of IDS1. Our findings illustrate an epigenetic mechanism by which IDS1 modulates salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signaling as well as salt tolerance in rice.</p>

Functional Diversity of Diterpene Synthases in the Biofuel Crop Switchgrass
<p>Diterpenoids constitute a diverse class of metabolites with critical functions in plant development, defense, and ecological adaptation. Major monocot crops, such as maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), deploy diverse blends of specialized diterpenoids as core components of biotic and abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> resilience. Here, we describe the genome-wide identification and functional characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>-related diterpene synthases (diTPSs) in the dedicated bioenergy crop switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>). Mining of the allotetraploid switchgrass genome identified an expansive diTPS family of 31 members, and biochemical analysis of 11 diTPSs revealed a modular metabolic network producing a diverse array of diterpenoid metabolites. In addition to <i>ent</i>-copalyl diphosphate (CPP) and <i>ent</i>-kaurene synthases predictably involved in gibberellin biosynthesis, we identified <i>syn</i>-CPP and <i>ent</i>-labda-13-en-8-ol diphosphate (LPP) synthases as well as two diTPSs forming (+)-labda-8,13<i>E</i>-dienyl diphosphate (8,13-CPP) and <i>ent-neo-</i>cis-trans-clerodienyl diphosphate (CT-CLPP) scaffolds not observed previously in plants. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the (+)-8,13-CPP and <i>ent-neo-</i>CT-CLPP synthases revealed residue substitutions in the active sites that altered product outcome, representing potential neofunctionalization events that occurred during diversification of the switchgrass diTPS family. The conversion of <i>ent</i>-CPP, <i>ent</i>-LPP, <i>syn</i>-CPP, and <i>ent-neo</i>-CT-CLPP by promiscuous diTPSs further yielded distinct labdane-type diterpene olefins and alcohols. Of these metabolites, the formation of 9β-hydroxy-<i>syn</i>-pimar-15-ene and the expression of the corresponding genes were induced in roots and leaves in response to oxidative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> and ultraviolet irradiation, indicating their possible roles in abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> adaptation. Together, these findings expand the known chemical space of diterpenoid metabolism in monocot crops toward systematically investigating and ultimately improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> resilience traits in crop species.</p>

TsNAC1 Is a Key Transcription Factor in Abiotic Stress Resistance and Growth
<p>NAC proteins constitute one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors, and a number of these proteins participate in the regulation of plant development and responses to abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. <i>T. HALOPHILA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> RELATED NAC1</i> (<i>TsNAC1</i>), cloned from the halophyte <i>Thellungiella halophila</i>, is a <i>NAC</i> transcription factor gene, and its overexpression can improve abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> resistance, especially in salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> tolerance, in both <i>T. halophila</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and retard the growth of these plants. In this study, the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 and RD26 from Arabidopsis was compared with the target genes’ promoter regions of TsNAC1 from <i>T. halophila</i>, and the results showed that the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 was higher in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) and yeast. The target sequence of the promoter from the target genes also was identified, and TsNAC1 was shown to target the positive regulators of ion transportation, such as <i>T. HALOPHILA H<sup>+</sup>-PPASE1</i>, and the transcription factors <i>MYB HYPOCOTYL ELONGATION-RELATED</i> and <i>HOMEOBOX12</i>. In addition, TsNAC1 negatively regulates the expansion of cells, inhibits <i>LIGHT-DEPENDENT SHORT HYPOCOTYLS1</i> and <i>UDP-XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE2</i>, and directly controls the expression of <i>MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA14</i>. Based on these results, we propose that TsNAC1 functions as an important upstream regulator of plant abiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> responses and vegetative growth.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In addition, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In addition, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG accumulation during heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in addition to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

Salicylic Acid-Dependent Plant Stress Signaling via Mitochondrial Succinate Dehydrogenase
<p>Mitochondria are known for their role in ATP production and generation of reactive oxygen species, but little is known about the mechanism of their early involvement in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signaling. The role of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in salicylic acid (SA) signaling was analyzed using two mutants: <i>disrupted in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> response1</i> (<i>dsr1</i>), which is a point mutation in SDH1 identified in a loss of SA signaling screen, and a knockdown mutant (<i>sdhaf2</i>) for SDH assembly factor 2 that is required for FAD insertion into SDH1. Both mutants showed strongly decreased SA-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> promoter responses and low SDH maximum capacity compared to wild type, while <i>dsr1</i> also showed low succinate affinity, low catalytic efficiency, and increased resistance to SDH competitive inhibitors. The SA-induced promoter responses could be partially rescued in <i>sdhaf2</i>, but not in <i>dsr1</i>, by supplementing the plant growth media with succinate. Kinetic characterization showed that low concentrations of either SA or ubiquinone binding site inhibitors increased SDH activity and induced mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production. Both <i>dsr1</i> and <i>sdhaf2</i> showed lower rates of SA-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in vitro in line with their low SA-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signaling responses in vivo. This provides quantitative and kinetic evidence that SA acts at or near the ubiquinone binding site of SDH to stimulate activity and contributes to plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signaling by increased rates of mitochondrial H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production, leading to part of the SA-dependent transcriptional response in plant cells.</p>

Transcription Factors PvERF15 and PvMTF-1 Form a Cadmium Stress Transcriptional Pathway
<p>In plants, cadmium (Cd)-responsive transcription factors are key downstream effectors of Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> transcriptional pathways, which are capable of converging Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> signals through triggering the expression of Cd detoxification genes. However, the upstream transcriptional regulatory pathways that modulate their responses to Cd are less clear. Previously, we identified the bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) METAL RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (PvMTF-1) that responds to Cd and confers Cd tolerance in planta. Here, we demonstrate an upstream transcriptional regulation of the <i>PvMTF-1</i> response to Cd. Using a yeast one-hybrid system, we cloned the bean ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR15 (PvERF15) that binds to the <i>PvMTF-1</i> promoter. <i>PvERF15</i> was strongly induced by Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong>, and its overexpression resulted in the up-regulation of <i>PvMTF-1</i>. DNA-protein interaction assays further revealed that PvERF15 binds directly to a 19-bp AC-rich element in the <i>PvMTF-1</i> promoter. The AC-rich element serves as a positive element bound by PvERF15 to activate gene expression. More importantly, knockdown of <i>PvERF15</i> by RNA interference resulted in reduced Cd-induced expression of <i>PvMTF-1</i>. <i>PvERF15</i> seems to be involved in Cd tolerance, since knockdown of <i>PvERF15</i> by RNA interference in bean leaf discs decreased Cd tolerance in a transient assay. Since PvERF15 is a component of the Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> transcriptional pathway in beans and <i>PvMTF-1</i> is one of its downstream targets, our findings provide a PvERF15/PvMTF-1 transcriptional pathway and thereby contribute to the understanding of Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stress</span></strong> transcriptional regulatory pathways in plants.</p>

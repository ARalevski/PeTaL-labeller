Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p>Cell motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and cancer cell invasion. It is generally thought that migrating cells grab and exert traction force onto the extracellular matrix in order to pull the cell body forward. While previous studies have shown that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> II deficient cells migrate efficiently, whether these cells exert traction forces during cell migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a force sensor and shRNA specific to each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA and IIB individually regulate cell migration and traction force generation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction force was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA deficient cells lost actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIB deficient cells maintained similar actin organization and focal adhesions as wild-type cells. Interestingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA deficient cells migrated faster than wild-type or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIB deficient cells on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA deficient cells exerted significantly less traction force at the leading edge than wild-type or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIB deficient cells. These results suggest that, in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA mediated force-generating machinery, cells move with minimal traction forces at the cell periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of cells to adapt and migrate.</p>

Cryo-EM structure of the mammalian ATP synthase tetramer bound with inhibitory protein IF1
<p>The mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (ATP) synthase produces most of the ATP required by mammalian cells. We isolated porcine tetrameric ATP synthase and solved its structure at 6.2-angstrom resolution using a single-particle cryo–electron microscopy method. Two classical V-shaped ATP synthase dimers lie antiparallel to each other to form an H-shaped ATP synthase tetramer, as viewed from the matrix. ATP synthase inhibitory factor subunit 1 (IF1) is a well-known in vivo inhibitor of mammalian ATP synthase at low pH. Two IF1 dimers link two ATP synthase dimers, which is consistent with the ATP synthase tetramer adopting an inhibited state. Within the tetramer, we refined structures of intact ATP synthase in two different rotational conformations at 3.34- and 3.45-Å resolution.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Extracellular ATP Shapes a Defense-Related Transcriptome Both Independently and along with Other Defense Signaling Pathways
<p>ATP is not only an essential metabolite of cellular biochemistry but also acts as a signal in the extracellular milieu. In plants, extracellular ATP is monitored by the purinergic receptor P2K1. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular ATP acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern in plants, and its signaling through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various pathogenic microorganisms. Biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens attack plants using different strategies, to which plants respond accordingly with salicylate-based or jasmonate/ethylene-based defensive signaling, respectively. Interestingly, defense mediated by P2K1 is effective against pathogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular ATP signaling and that of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. To address this issue, we analyzed ATP-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the signaling pathways of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate (classic defense hormones) as well as a mutant and an overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor. We found that P2K1 function is crucial for faithful ATP-induced transcriptional changes and that a subset of genes is more responsive in the P2K1 overexpression line. We also found that more than half of the ATP-responsive genes required signaling by one or more of the pathways for the classical defense hormones, with the jasmonate-based signaling being more critical than others. By contrast, the other ATP-responsive genes were unaffected by deficiencies in signaling for any of the classical defense hormones. These ATP-responsive genes were highly enriched for defense-related Gene Ontology terms. We further tested the ATP-induced genes in knockout mutants of transcription factors, demonstrating that MYCs acting downstream of the jasmonate receptor complex and calmodulin-binding transcription activators are nuclear transducers of P2K1-mediated extracellular ATP signaling.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In addition, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP addition in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon addition of JA biosynthesis inhibitors. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Root Cell-Specific Regulators of Phosphate-Dependent Growth
<p>Cellular specialization in abiotic stress responses is an important regulatory feature driving plant acclimation. Our in silico approach of iterative coexpression, interaction, and enrichment analyses predicted root cell-specific regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation response networks in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). This included three uncharacterized genes termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation-induced gene interacting Root Cell Enriched (<i>PRCE1</i>, <i>PRCE2</i>, and <i>PRCE3</i>). Root cell-specific enrichment of 12 candidates was confirmed in promoter-GFP lines. T-DNA insertion lines of 11 genes showed changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e status and growth responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e availability compared with the wild type. Some mutants (<i>cbl1</i>, <i>cipk2</i>, <i>prce3</i>, and <i>wdd1</i>) displayed strong biomass gain irrespective of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e supply, while others (<i>cipk14</i>, <i>mfs1</i>, <i>prce1</i>, <i>prce2</i>, and <i>s6k2</i>) were able to sustain growth under low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e supply better than the wild type. Notably, root or shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e accumulation did not strictly correlate with organ growth. Mutant response patterns markedly differed from those of master regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e homeostasis, <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>E STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> (<i>PHR1</i>) and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>E2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>), demonstrating that negative growth responses in the latter can be overcome when cell-specific regulators are targeted. RNA sequencing analysis highlighted the transcriptomic plasticity in these mutants and revealed PHR1-dependent and -independent regulatory circuits with gene coexpression profiles that were highly correlated to the quantified physiological traits. The results demonstrate how in silico prediction of cell-specific, stress-responsive genes uncovers key regulators and how their manipulation can have positive impacts on plant growth under abiotic stress.</p>

Prospective Study of Adenosine on Atrioventricular Nodal Conduction in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients After Heart Transplantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Supraventricular tachycardia is common after heart transplantation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e, the standard therapy for treating supraventricular tachycardia in children and adults without transplantation, is relatively contraindicated after transplantation because of a presumed risk of prolonged atrioventricular block in denervated hearts.

After catheterization, a transvenous pacing catheter was placed and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e was given following a dose-escalation protocol until atrioventricular block was achieved. The incidence of clinically significant asystole (≥12 seconds after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e) was quantified.

The pseudokinase domains of guanylyl cyclase–A and –B allosterically increase the affinity of their catalytic domains for substrate
<p>Natriuretic peptides regulate multiple physiologic systems by activating transmembrane receptors containing intracellular guanylyl cyclase domains, such as GC-A and GC-B, also known as Npr1 and Npr2, respectively. Both enzymes contain an intracellular, phosphorylated pseudokinase domain (PKD) critical for activation of the C-terminal cGMP-synthesizing guanylyl cyclase domain. Because ATP allosterically activates GC-A and GC-B, we investigated how ATP binding to the PKD influenced guanylyl cyclase activity. Molecular modeling indicated that all the residues of the ATP-binding site of the prototypical kinase PKA, except the catalytic aspartate, are conserved in the PKDs of GC-A and GC-B. Kinase-inactivating alanine substitutions for the invariant lysine in subdomain II or the aspartate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-B failed to decrease enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e content, consistent with the PKDs lacking kinase activity. In contrast, both mutations reduced enzyme activation by blocking the ability of ATP to decrease the Michaelis constant without affecting peptide-dependent activation. The analogous lysine-to-alanine substitution in a glutamate-substituted phosphomimetic mutant form of GC-B also reduced enzyme activity, consistent with ATP stimulating guanylyl cyclase activity through an allosteric, phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Mutations designed to rigidify the conserved regulatory or catalytic spines within the PKDs increased guanylyl cyclase activity, increased sensitivity to natriuretic peptide, or reduced the Michaelis constant in the absence of ATP, consistent with ATP binding stabilizing the PKD in a conformation analogous to that of catalytically active kinases. We conclude that allosteric mechanisms evolutionarily conserved in the PKDs promote the catalytic activation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases.</p>

A defect in KCa3.1 channel activity limits the ability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from cancer patients to infiltrate an adenosine-rich microenvironment
<p>The limited ability of cytotoxic T cells to infiltrate solid tumors hampers immune surveillance and the efficacy of immunotherapies in cancer. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e accumulates in solid tumors and inhibits tumor-specific T cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e inhibits T cell motility through the A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) and suppression of KCa3.1 channels. We conducted three-dimensional chemotaxis experiments to elucidate the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e on the migration of peripheral blood CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. The chemotaxis of HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was reduced in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e, and the effect was greater on HNSCC CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells than on healthy donor (HD) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This response correlated with the inability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to infiltrate tumors. The effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e was mimicked by an A<sub>2A</sub>R agonist and prevented by an A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist. We found no differences in A<sub>2A</sub>R expression, 3′,5′-cyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e mono<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e abundance, or protein kinase A type 1 activity between HNSCC and HD CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

The Phosphate Fast-Responsive Genes <i>PECP1</i> and <i>PPsPase1</i> Affect Phosphocholine and Phosphoethanolamine Content<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation-mediated induction of the HAD-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>ases PPsPase1 (AT1G73010) and PECP1 (AT1G17710) has been reported in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, little is known about their in vivo function or impact on plant responses to nutrient deficiency. The preferences of PPsPase1 and PECP1 for different substrates have been studied in vitro but require confirmation in planta. Here, we examined the in vivo function of both enzymes using a reverse genetics approach. We demonstrated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 affect plant phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine content, but not the pyro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e-related phenotypes. These observations suggest that the enzymes play a similar role in planta related to the recycling of polar heads from membrane lipids that is triggered during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation. Altering the expression of the genes encoding these enzymes had no effect on lipid composition, possibly due to compensation by other lipid recycling pathways triggered during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation. Furthermore, our results indicated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 do not influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e homeostasis, since the inactivation of these genes had no effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e content or on the induction of molecular markers related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation. A combination of transcriptomics and imaging analyses revealed that PPsPase1 and PECP1 display a highly dynamic expression pattern that closely mirrors the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e status. This temporal dynamism, combined with the wide range of induction levels, broad expression, and lack of a direct effect on Pi content and regulation, makes PPsPase1 and PECP1 useful molecular markers of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation response.</p>

CD73 on T Cells Orchestrates Cardiac Wound Healing After Myocardial Infarction by Purinergic Metabolic Reprogramming
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>T cells are required for proper healing after myocardial infarction. The mechanism of their beneficial action, however, is unknown. The proinflammatory danger signal ATP, released from damaged cells, is degraded by the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 to the anti-inflammatory mediator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e. Here, we investigate the contribution of CD73-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e produced by T cells to cardiac remodeling after ischemia/reperfusion and define its mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Myocardial ischemia (50 minutes followed by reperfusion) was induced in global CD73<sup>−/−</sup> and CD4-CD73<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup> mice. Tissue injury, T-cell purinergic signaling, cytokines, and cardiac function (magnetic resonance tomography at 9.4 T over 4 weeks) were analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Changes in functional parameters of CD4-CD73<sup>−/−</sup> mice were identical to those in global CD73 knockouts (KOs). T cells infiltrating the injured heart significantly upregulated at the gene (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and protein (enzymatic activity) levels critical transporters and enzymes (connexin43, connexin37, pannexin-1, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1, CD39, CD73, ecto-nucleotide pyro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>ase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3, CD157, CD38) for the accelerated release and hydrolysis of ATP, cAMP, AMP, and NAD to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e. It is surprising that a lack of CD39 on T cells (from CD39<sup>−/−</sup> mice) did not alter ATP hydrolysis and very likely involves pyro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>ases (ecto-nucleotide pyro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>ase/phosphodiesterases 1 and 3). Circulating T cells predominantly expressed A<sub>2a</sub> receptor (A<sub>2a</sub>R) transcripts. After myocardial infarction, A<sub>2b</sub> receptor (A<sub>2b</sub>R) transcription was induced in both T cells and myeloid cells in the heart. Thus, A<sub>2a</sub>R and A<sub>2b</sub>R signaling may contribute to myocardial responses after myocardial infarction. In the case of T cells, this was associated with an accelerated secretion of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines (interleukin-2, interferon-γ, and interleukin-17) when CD73 was lacking. Cytokine production by T cells from peripheral lymph nodes was inhibited by A<sub>2a</sub>R activation (CGS-21680). The A<sub>2b</sub>R agonist BAY 60-6583 showed off-target effects. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e receptor agonist NECA inhibited interferon-γ and stimulated interleukin-6 production, each of which was antagonized by a specific A<sub>2b</sub>R antagonist (PSB-603).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work demonstrates that CD73 on T cells plays a crucial role in the cardiac wound healing process after myocardial infarction.

Augmentation of Muscle Blood Flow by Ultrasound Cavitation Is Mediated by ATP and Purinergic Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Augmentation of tissue blood flow by therapeutic ultrasound is thought to rely on convective shear.

We hypothesized that purinergic signaling is responsible for shear-dependent increases in muscle perfusion during therapeutic cavitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Unilateral exposure of the proximal hindlimb of mice (with or without ischemia produced by iliac ligation) to therapeutic ultrasound (1.3 MHz, mechanical index 1.3) was performed for 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 2×10<sup>8</sup> lipid microbubbles. Microvascular perfusion was evaluated by low-power contrast ultrasound perfusion imaging. In vivo muscle ATP release and in vitro ATP release from endothelial cells or erythrocytes were assessed by a luciferin-luciferase assay. Purinergic signaling pathways were assessed by studying interventions that (1) accelerated ATP degradation; (2) inhibited P2Y receptors, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e receptors, or K<sub>ATP</sub> channels; or (3) inhibited downstream signaling pathways involving endothelial nitric oxide synthase or prostanoid production (indomethacin). Augmentation in muscle perfusion by ultrasound cavitation was assessed in a proof-of-concept clinical trial in 12 subjects with stable sickle cell disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Therapeutic ultrasound cavitation increased muscle perfusion by 7-fold in normal mice, reversed tissue ischemia for up to 24 hours in the murine model of peripheral artery disease, and doubled muscle perfusion in patients with sickle cell disease. Augmentation in flow extended well beyond the region of ultrasound exposure. Ultrasound cavitation produced an ≈40-fold focal and sustained increase in ATP, the source of which included both endothelial cells and erythrocytes. Inhibitory studies indicated that ATP was a critical mediator of flow augmentation that acts primarily through either P2Y receptors or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e produced by ectonucleotidase activity.

ATP promotes the fast migration of dendritic cells through the activity of pannexin 1 channels and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors
<p>Upon its release from injured cells, such as infected, transformed, inflamed, or necrotic cells, extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e-5′-tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (ATP) acts as a danger signal that recruits phagocytes, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), to the site of injury. The sensing of extracellular ATP occurs through purinergic (P2) receptors. We investigated the cellular mechanisms linking purinergic signaling to DC motility. We found that ATP stimulated fast DC motility through an autocrine signaling loop, which was initiated by the activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and further amplified by pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels. Upon stimulation of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor by ATP, Panx1 contributed to fast DC motility by increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane, which resulted in supplementary ATP release. In the absence of Panx1, DCs failed to increase their speed of migration in response to ATP, despite exhibiting a normal P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. In addition to DC migration, Panx1 channel– and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–dependent signaling was further required to stimulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In vivo, functional Panx1 channels were required for the homing of DCs to lymph nodes, although they were dispensable for DC maturation. These data suggest that P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and Panx1 channels are crucial players in the regulation of DC migration to endogenous danger signals.</p>

Mitotic phosphorylation regulates Hsp72 spindle localization by uncoupling ATP binding from substrate release
<p>Hsp72 is a member of the 70-kDa heat shock family of molecular chaperones (Hsp70s) that comprise a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) connected by a linker that couples the exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e di<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (ADP) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (ATP) with the release of the protein substrate. Mitotic phosphorylation of Hsp72 by the kinase NEK6 at Thr<sup>66</sup> located in the NBD promotes the localization of Hsp72 to the mitotic spindle and is required for efficient spindle assembly and chromosome congression and segregation. We determined the crystal structure of the Hsp72 NBD containing a genetically encoded phosphoserine at position 66. This revealed structural changes that stabilized interactions between subdomains within the NBD. ATP binding to the NBD of unmodified Hsp72 resulted in the release of substrate from the SBD, but phosphorylated Hsp72 retained substrate in the presence of ATP. Mutations that prevented phosphorylation-dependent subdomain interactions restored the connection between ATP binding and substrate release. Thus, phosphorylation of Thr<sup>66</sup> is a reversible mechanism that decouples the allosteric connection between nucleotide binding and substrate release, providing further insight into the regulation of the Hsp70 family. We propose that phosphorylation of Hsp72 on Thr<sup>66</sup> by NEK6 during mitosis promotes its localization to the spindle by stabilizing its interactions with components of the mitotic spindle.</p>

Myosins XI Are Involved in Exocytosis of Cellulose Synthase Complexes
<p>In plants, cellulose is synthesized at the cell surface by plasma membrane (PM)-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that underpin delivery of CSCs to the PM, however, are poorly understood. Cortical microtubules have been shown to interact with CESA-containing compartments and mark the site for CSC delivery, but are not required for the delivery itself. Here, we demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> XI and the actin cytoskeleton mediate CSC delivery to the PM by coordinating the exocytosis of CESA-containing compartments. Measurement of cellulose content indicated that cellulose biosynthesis was significantly reduced in a <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> xik xi1 xi2</i> triple-knockout mutant. By combining genetic and pharmacological disruption of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> activity with quantitative live-cell imaging, we observed decreased abundance of PM-localized CSCs and reduced delivery rate of CSCs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>-deficient cells. These phenotypes correlated with a significant increase in failed vesicle secretion events at the PM as well as an abnormal accumulation of CESA-containing compartments at the cell cortex. Through high-resolution spatiotemporal assays of cortical vesicle behavior, we identified defects in CSC vesicle tethering and fusion at the PM. Furthermore, disruption of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> activity reduced the delivery of several other secretory markers to the PM and reduced constitutive and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These findings reveal a previously undescribed role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> in vesicle secretion and cellulose production at the cytoskeleton-PM-cell wall nexus.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Proline Accumulation Is Regulated by Transcription Factors Associated with Phosphate Starvation
<p>Pro accumulation in plants is a well-documented physiological response to osmotic stress caused by drought or salinity. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the stress and ABA-induced Δ1-PYRROLINE-5-CARBOXYLATE SYNTHETASE1 (<i>P5CS1</i>) gene was previously shown to control Pro biosynthesis in such adverse conditions. To identify regulatory factors that control the transcription of <i>P5CS1</i>, Y1H screens were performed with a genomic fragment of <i>P5CS1</i>, containing 1.2-kB promoter and 0.8-kb transcribed regions. The myeloblastosis (MYB)-type transcription factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>E STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) and PHR1-LIKE1 (PHL1) were identified to bind to <i>P5CS1</i> regulatory sequences in the first intron, which carries a conserved PHR1-binding site (P1BS) motif. Binding of PHR1 and PHL1 factors to P1BS was confirmed by Y1H, electrophoretic mobility assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e starvation led to gradual increase in Pro content in wild-type Arabidopsis plants as well as transcriptional activation of <i>P5CS1</i> and PRO DEHYDROGENASE2 genes. Induction of <i>P5CS1</i> transcription and Pro accumulation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e deficiency was considerably reduced by <i>phr1</i> and <i>phl1</i> mutations and was impaired in the ABA-deficient <i>aba2-3</i> and ABA-insensitive <i>abi4-1</i> mutants. Growth and viability of <i>phr1phl1</i> double mutant was significantly reduced in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e-depleted medium, while growth was only marginally affected in the <i>aba2-3</i> mutants, suggesting that ABA is implicated in growth retardation in such nutritional stress. Our results reveal a previously unknown link between Pro metabolism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e nutrition and show that Pro biosynthesis is target of cross talk between ABA signaling and regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e homeostasis through PHR1- and PHL1-mediated transcriptional activation of the <i>P5CS1</i> gene.</p>

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or β-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of adenine nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
In <i>Drosophila</i>, RhoGEF2 cooperates with activated Ras in tumorigenesis through a pathway involving Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II and JNK signalling
<p>The <i>Ras</i> oncogene contributes to ∼30% of human cancers, but alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis. In a <i>Drosophila</i> screen for oncogenes that cooperate with an activated allele of <i>Ras</i> (<i>Ras<sup>ACT</sup></i>) to promote tissue overgrowth and invasion, we identified the GTP exchange factor <i>RhoGEF2</i>, an activator of Rho-family signalling. Here, we show that RhoGEF2 also cooperates with an activated allele of a downstream effector of Ras, <i>Raf</i> (<i>Raf<sup>GOF</sup></i>). We dissect the downstream pathways through which RhoGEF2 cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> (and Raf<sup>GOF</sup>), and show that RhoGEF2 requires Rho1, but not Rac, for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, of the Rho1 effectors, we show that RhoGEF2 + Ras (Raf)-mediated tumorigenesis requires the Rho kinase (Rok)–Myosin-II pathway, but not Diaphanous, Lim kinase or protein kinase N. The Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II pathway leads to the activation of Jun kinase (JNK), in cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>. Moreover, we show that activation of Rok or Myosin II, using constitutively active transgenes, is sufficient for cooperative tumorigenesis with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>, and together with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> leads to strong activation of JNK. Our results show that Rok–Myosin-II activity is necessary and sufficient for Ras-mediated tumorigenesis. Our observation that activation of Myosin II, which regulates Filamentous actin (F-actin) contractility without affecting F-actin levels, cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> to promote JNK activation and tumorigenesis, suggests that increased cell contractility is a key factor in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we show that signalling via the Tumour necrosis factor (TNF; also known as Egr)-ligand–JNK pathway is most likely the predominant pathway that activates JNK upon Rok activation. Overall, our analysis highlights the need for further analysis of the Rok–Myosin-II pathway in cooperation with Ras in human cancers.</p>

MicroRNA-195 Regulates Metabolism in Failing Myocardium Via Alterations in Sirtuin 3 Expression and Mitochondrial Protein Acetylation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities of the failing myocardium coupled with an energy-depleted state and cardiac remodeling. The mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of mitochondrial function through regulating the mitochondrial acetylome. It is interesting to note that unique cardiac and systemic microRNAs have been shown to play an important role in cardiac remodeling by modulating key signaling elements in the myocardium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cellular signaling was analyzed in human cardiomyocyte-like AC16 cells, and acetylation levels in rodent models of SIRT3<sup>–/–</sup>and transgenic microRNA-195 (miR-195) overexpression were compared with wild type. Luciferase assays, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation assays, and echocardiographic analysis were performed. Enzymatic activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and ATP synthase were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In failing human myocardium, we observed induction of miR-195 along with decreased expression of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 that was associated with increased global protein acetylation. We further investigated the role of miR-195 in SIRT3-mediated metabolic processes and its impact on regulating enzymes involved in deacetylation. Proteomic analysis of the total acetylome showed increased overall acetylation, and specific lysine acetylation of 2 central mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, PDH and ATP synthase, as well. miR-195 downregulates SIRT3 expression through direct 3′-untranslated region targeting. Treatments with either sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide, small interfering RNA–mediated SIRT3 knockdown or miR-195 overexpression enhanced acetylation of PDH complex and ATP synthase. This effect diminished PDH and ATP synthase activity and impaired mitochondrial respiration.SIRT3<sup>–/–</sup> and miR-195 transgenic mice consistently showed enhanced global protein acetylation, including PDH complex and ATP synthase, associated with decreased enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Altogether, these data suggest that increased levels of miR-195 in failing myocardium regulate a novel pathway that involves direct SIRT3 suppression and enzymatic inhibition via increased acetylation of PDH and ATP synthase that are essential for cardiac energy metabolism.</p></sec>

Increased activity of TNAP compensates for reduced adenosine production and promotes ectopic calcification in the genetic disease ACDC
<p>ACDC (arterial calcification due to deficiency of CD73) is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from loss-of-function mutations in <i>NT5E</i>, which encodes CD73, a 5′-ectonucleotidase that converts extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e mono<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e. ACDC patients display progressive calcification of lower extremity arteries, causing limb ischemia. Tissue-nonspecific alkaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>ase (TNAP), which converts pyro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (PPi) to inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (Pi), and extracellular purine metabolism play important roles in other inherited forms of vascular calcification. Compared to cells from healthy subjects, induced pluripotent stem cell–derived mesenchymal stromal cells (iMSCs) from ACDC patients displayed accelerated calcification and increased TNAP activity when cultured under conditions that promote osteogenesis. TNAP activity generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e in iMSCs derived from ACDC patients but not in iMSCs from control subjects, which have CD73. In response to osteogenic stimulation, ACDC patient–derived iMSCs had decreased amounts of the TNAP substrate PPi, an inhibitor of extracellular matrix calcification, and exhibited increased activation of AKT, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and the 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), a pathway that promotes calcification. In vivo, teratomas derived from ACDC patient cells showed extensive calcification and increased TNAP activity. Treating mice bearing these teratomas with an A2b <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e receptor agonist, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, or the bisphosphonate etidronate reduced calcification. These results show that an increase of TNAP activity in ACDC contributes to ectopic calcification by disrupting the extracellular balance of PPi and Pi and identify potential therapeutic targets for ACDC.</p>

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p>Lipid A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. Lipid A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>es of lipid A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different lipid A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the lipid A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>es with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory protein PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e group to lipid A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modification of the lipid A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>es with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modification of lipid A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>es solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in lipid A negative charge.

Chemical synapses without synaptic vesicles: Purinergic neurotransmission through a CALHM1 channel-mitochondrial signaling complex
<p>Conventional chemical synapses in the nervous system involve a presynaptic accumulation of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane to release neurotransmitters that activate postsynaptic receptors. In taste buds, type II receptor cells do not have conventional synaptic features but nonetheless show regulated release of their afferent neurotransmitter, ATP, through a large-pore, voltage-gated channel, CALHM1. Immunohistochemistry revealed that CALHM1 was localized to points of contact between the receptor cells and sensory nerve fibers. Ultrastructural and super-resolution light microscopy showed that the CALHM1 channels were consistently associated with distinctive, large (1- to 2-μm) mitochondria spaced 20 to 40 nm from the presynaptic membrane. Pharmacological disruption of the mitochondrial respiratory chain limited the ability of taste cells to release ATP, suggesting that the immediate source of released ATP was the mitochondrion rather than a cytoplasmic pool of ATP. These large mitochondria may serve as both a reservoir of releasable ATP and the site of synthesis. The juxtaposition of the large mitochondria to areas of membrane displaying CALHM1 also defines a restricted compartment that limits the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> upon opening of the nonselective CALHM1 channels. These findings reveal a distinctive organelle signature and functional organization for regulated, focal release of purinergic signals in the absence of synaptic vesicles.</p>

Mechanism of allosteric modulation of P-glycoprotein by transport substrates and inhibitors
<p>The ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein plays a central role in clearance of xenobiotics in humans and is implicated in cancer resistance to chemotherapy.

Our results reveal that substrate-induced acceleration of ATP hydrolysis correlates with stabilization of a high-energy, post-ATP hydrolysis state characterized by structurally asymmetric nucleotide-binding sites. By contrast, this state is destabilized in the substrate-free cycle and by high-affinity inhibitors in favor of structurally symmetric nucleotide binding sites. Together with previous data, our findings lead to a general model of substrate and inhibitor coupling to P-glycoprotein.</p>

Substrate-engaged 26<i>S</i> proteasome structures reveal mechanisms for ATP-hydrolysis–driven translocation

The heterohexameric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>ase (ATPase) motor of the proteasome unfolds and translocates targeted protein substrates into the open gate of a proteolytic core while a proteasomal deubiquitinase concomitantly removes substrate-attached ubiquitin chains. However, the mechanisms by which ATP hydrolysis drives the conformational changes responsible for these processes have remained elusive. Here we present the cryo–electron microscopy structures of four distinct conformational states of the actively ATP-hydrolyzing, substrate-engaged 26<i>S</i> proteasome. These structures reveal how mechanical substrate translocation accelerates deubiquitination and how ATP-binding, -hydrolysis, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e-release events are coordinated within the AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) motor to induce conformational changes and propel the substrate through the central pore.</p>

The two nucleotide-binding domains form a closed dimer occluding two ATP molecules. The drug-binding cavity observed in the inward-facing structures is reorientated toward the extracellular space and compressed to preclude substrate binding. This observation indicates that ATP binding, not hydrolysis, promotes substrate release.

Although crystal structures of the F<sub>1</sub> region have illustrated how this rotation leads to ATP synthesis, understanding how proton translocation produces the rotation has been impeded by the lack of an experimental atomic model for the F<sub>O</sub> region.

Growth at Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Requires Acclimation of the Respiratory Chain to Support Photosynthesis
<p>Plants will experience an elevated atmospheric concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> (ECO<sub>2</sub>) in the future. Growth of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) at ECO<sub>2</sub> more than doubled the leaf protein amount of alternative oxidase (AOX), a non-energy-conserving component of mitochondrial respiration. To test the functional significance of this AOX increase, wild-type tobacco was compared with AOX knockdown and overexpression lines, following growth at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or ECO<sub>2</sub>. The ECO<sub>2</sub>-grown AOX knockdowns had a reduced capacity for triose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e use (TPU) during photosynthesis compared with the other plant lines. This TPU limitation of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation was associated with an increased accumulation of glucose-6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e, sucrose, and starch in the leaves of the knockdowns. Under TPU-limiting conditions, the size of the proton gradient and proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane was enhanced in the knockdowns relative to the other plant lines, suggesting a restriction of chloroplast ATP synthase activity. This restriction was not due to a decline in ATP synthase (AtpB) protein amount. The knockdowns also displayed a photosystem stoichiometry adjustment at ECO<sub>2</sub>, which was absent in the other plant lines. Additional experiments showed that the way in which AOX supports photosynthesis at ECO<sub>2</sub> is distinct from its previously described role in supporting photosynthesis during water deficit. The results are discussed in terms of how AOX contributes to TPU capacity and the maintenance of chloroplast ATP synthase activity at ECO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the evidence suggests that AOX respiration is needed to maintain both the carbon and energy balance in photosynthetic tissues during growth at ECO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

The cost of muscle power production: muscle oxygen consumption per unit work increases at low temperatures in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>
<p>Metabolic energy (ATP) supply to muscle is essential to support activity and behaviour. It is expected, therefore, that there is strong selection to maximise muscle power output for a given rate of ATP use. However, the viscosity and stiffness of muscle increases with a decrease in temperature, which means that more ATP may be required to achieve a given work output. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ATP use increases at lower temperatures for a given power output in <i>Xenopus laevis.</i> To account for temperature variation at different time scales, we considered the interaction between acclimation for 4 weeks (to 15 or 25°C) and acute exposure to these temperatures. Cold-acclimated frogs had greater sprint speed at 15°C than warm-acclimated animals. However, acclimation temperature did not affect isolated gastrocnemius muscle biomechanics. Isolated muscle produced greater tetanus force, and faster isometric force generation and relaxation, and generated more work loop power at 25°C than at 15°C acute test temperature. Oxygen consumption of isolated muscle at rest did not change with test temperature, but oxygen consumption while muscle was performing work was significantly higher at 15°C than at 25°C, regardless of acclimation conditions. Muscle therefore consumed significantly more oxygen at 15°C for a given work output than at 25°C, and plastic responses did not modify this thermodynamic effect. The metabolic cost of muscle performance and activity therefore increased with a decrease in temperature. To maintain activity across a range of temperature, animals must increase ATP production or face an allocation trade-off at lower temperatures.

Disease Models & Mechanisms
The fraction of strongly bound cross-bridges is increased in mice that carry the myopathy-linked myosin heavy chain mutation MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>opathies have emerged as a new group of diseases and are caused by mutations in genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. One major hallmark of these diseases is skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of muscle fibers from <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i> mice, which carry a mutation that provokes an L342Q change within the catalytic domain of the type IIb skeletal muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> protein MYH4. Because homozygous animals develop rapid muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis, they must be killed by postnatal day 13, so all experiments were performed using skeletal muscles from adult heterozygous animals (<i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+). <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice contain MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup> expressed at 7% of the levels of the wild-type (WT) protein, and are overtly and histologically normal. However, mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized fibers revealed, upon maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, higher stiffness as well as altered meridional and equatorial reflections in <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice when compared with age-matched WT animals. Under rigor conditions, by contrast, no difference was observed between <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ and WT mice. Altogether, these findings prove that, in adult <i>MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup></i> heterozygous mice, the transition from weak to strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> cross-bridge binding is facilitated, increasing the number of strongly attached <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> heads, thus enhancing force production. These changes are predictably exacerbated in the type IIb fibers of homozygous mice, in which the embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> isoform is fully replaced by MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>, leading to a hypercontraction, muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>opathies.</p>

PAR-2, LGL-1 and the CDC-42 GAP CHIN-1 act in distinct pathways to maintain polarity in the <i>C. elegans</i> embryo
<p>In the one-cell <i>C. elegans</i> embryo, polarity is maintained by mutual antagonism between the anterior cortical proteins PAR-3, PKC-3, PAR-6 and CDC-42, and the posterior cortical proteins PAR-2 and LGL-1 on the posterior cortex. The mechanisms by which these proteins interact to maintain polarity are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigate the interplay among PAR-2, LGL-1, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>, the anterior PAR proteins and CDC-42. We find that PAR-2 and LGL-1 affect cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> accumulation by different mechanisms. LGL-1 does not directly antagonize the accumulation of cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> and instead plays a role in regulating PAR-6 levels. By contrast, PAR-2 likely has separate roles in regulating cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> accumulation and preventing the expansion of the anterior cortical domain. We also provide evidence that asymmetry of active CDC-42 can be maintained independently of LGL-1 and PAR-2 by a redundant pathway that includes the CDC-42 GAP CHIN-1. Finally, we show that, in addition to its primary role in regulating the size of the anterior cortical domain via its binding to PAR-6, CDC-42 has a secondary role in regulating cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> that is not dependent on PAR-6.</p>

Mitochondrial redox sensing by the kinase ATM maintains cellular antioxidant capacity
<p>Mitochondria are integral to cellular energy metabolism and ATP production and are involved in regulating many cellular processes. Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which not only can damage cellular components but also participate in signal transduction. The kinase ATM, which is mutated in the neurodegenerative, autosomal recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), is a key player in the nuclear DNA damage response. However, ATM also performs a redox-sensing function mediated through formation of ROS-dependent disulfide-linked dimers. We found that mitochondria-derived hydrogen peroxide promoted ATM dimerization. In HeLa cells, ATM dimers were localized to the nucleus and inhibited by the redox regulatory protein thioredoxin 1 (TRX1), suggesting the existence of a ROS-mediated, stress-signaling relay from mitochondria to the nucleus. ATM dimer formation did not affect its association with chromatin in the absence or presence of nuclear DNA damage, consistent with the separation of its redox and DNA damage signaling functions. Comparative analysis of U2OS cells expressing either wild-type ATM or the redox sensing–deficient C2991L mutant revealed that one function of ATM redox sensing is to promote glucose flux through the pentose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e pathway (PPP) by increasing the abundance and activity of glucose-6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e dehydrogenase (G6PD), thereby increasing cellular antioxidant capacity. The PPP produces the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coenzym</span></strong>e NADPH needed for a robust antioxidant response, including the regeneration of TRX1, indicating the existence of a regulatory feedback loop involving ATM and TRX1. We propose that loss of the mitochondrial ROS-sensing function of ATM may cause cellular ROS accumulation and oxidative stress in A-T.</p>

Bacterial pseudokinase catalyzes protein polyglutamylation to inhibit the SidE-family ubiquitin ligases

Here, we show that the <i>Legionella</i> meta-effector SidJ adopts a protein kinase fold, yet unexpectedly catalyzes protein polyglutamylation. SidJ is activated by host-cell calmodulin to polyglutamylate the SidE family of ubiquitin (Ub) ligases. Crystal structures of the SidJ-calmodulin complex reveal a protein kinase fold that catalyzes ATP-dependent isopeptide bond formation between the amino group of free glutamate and the γ-carboxyl group of an active-site glutamate in SidE. We show that SidJ polyglutamylation of SidE, and the consequent inactivation of Ub ligase activity, is required for successful <i>Legionella</i> replication in a viable eukaryotic host cell.</p>

ATP as a biological hydrotrope
<p>Hydrotropes are small molecules that solubilize hydrophobic molecules in aqueous solutions. Typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic molecules and differ from classical surfactants in that they have low cooperativity of aggregation and work at molar concentrations. Here, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (ATP) has properties of a biological hydrotrope. It can both prevent the formation of and dissolve previously formed protein aggregates. This chemical property is manifested at physiological concentrations between 5 and 10 millimolar. Therefore, in addition to being an energy source for biological reactions, for which micromolar concentrations are sufficient, we propose that millimolar concentrations of ATP may act to keep proteins soluble. This may in part explain why ATP is maintained in such high concentrations in cells.</p>

Distortion of histone octamer core promotes nucleosome mobilization by a chromatin remodeler
<p>Adenosine 5′-tri<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e (ATP)–dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes play essential biological roles by mobilizing nucleosomal DNA. Yet, how DNA is mobilized despite the steric constraints placed by the histone octamer remains unknown. Using methyl transverse relaxation–optimized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a 450-kilodalton complex, we show that the chromatin remodeler, SNF2h, distorts the histone octamer. Binding of SNF2h in an activated ATP state changes the dynamics of buried histone residues. Preventing octamer distortion by site-specific disulfide linkages inhibits nucleosome sliding by SNF2h while promoting octamer eviction by the SWI-SNF complex, RSC. Our findings indicate that the histone core of a nucleosome is more plastic than previously imagined and that octamer deformation plays different roles based on the type of chromatin remodeler. Octamer plasticity may contribute to chromatin regulation beyond ATP-dependent remodeling.</p>

The biosynthetic pathway of coenzyme F430 in methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea
<p>Methyl-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coenzym</span></strong>e M reductase (MCR) is the key enzyme of methanogenesis and anaerobic methane oxidation. The activity of MCR is dependent on the unique nickel-containing tetrapyrrole known as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coenzym</span></strong>e F430. We used comparative genomics to identify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coenzym</span></strong>e F430 biosynthesis (<i>cfb</i>) genes and characterized the encoded enzymes from <i>Methanosarcina acetivorans</i> C2A. The pathway involves nickelochelation by a nickel-specific chelatase, followed by amidation to form Ni-sirohydrochlorin <i>a</i>,<i>c</i>-diamide. Next, a primitive homolog of nitrogenase mediates a six-electron reduction and γ-lactamization reaction before a Mur ligase homolog forms the six-membered carbocyclic ring in the final step of the pathway. These data show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coenzym</span></strong>e F430 can be synthesized from sirohydrochlorin using Cfb enzymes produced heterologously in a nonmethanogen host and identify several targets for inhibitors of biological methane formation.</p>

A Specific Glycogen Mobilization Strategy Enables Rapid Awakening of Dormant Cyanobacteria from Chlorosis
<p>Many organisms survive stressful conditions via entry into a dormant state that can be rapidly exited when the stressor disappears; this ability provides a strong selective advantage. In the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803, the exit from nitrogen chlorosis takes less than 48 h and is enabled by the impressive metabolic flexibility of these cyanobacteria, which pass through heterotrophic and mixotrophic phases before reentering photoautotrophic growth. Switching between these states requires delicate coordination of carbohydrate oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and photosynthesis. Here, we investigated the contribution of the different carbon catabolic routes by assessing mutants of these pathways during nitrogen chlorosis and resuscitation. The addition of nitrate to nitrogen-starved cells rapidly starts the awakening program. Metabolism switches from maintenance metabolism, characterized by residual photosynthesis and low cellular ATP levels, to an initial heterotrophic phase, characterized by respiration and an immediate increase in ATP levels. This respiration relies on glycogen breakdown catalyzed by the glycogen phosphorylase GlgP2. In the following transient mixotrophic phase, photosynthesis and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation restart and glycogen is consumed. During the mixotrophic phase, parallel operation of the oxidative pentose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e cycle and the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is required for resuscitation to proceed; the glycolytic route via the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway has minor importance. Our data suggest that, during resuscitation, only the Entner-Doudoroff and oxidative pentose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e pathways supply the metabolic intermediates necessary for the anabolic reactions required to reconstitute a vegetative cell. Intriguingly, the key enzymes for glycogen catabolism are already expressed during the preceding chlorotic phase, in apparent preparation for rapid resuscitation.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Starch Turnover and Metabolism during Flower and Early Embryo Development
<p>The accumulation of starch within photosynthetic tissues and within dedicated storage organs has been characterized extensively in many species, and a function in buffering carbon availability or in fueling later growth phases, respectively, has been proposed. However, developmentally regulated starch turnover within heterotrophic tissues other than dedicated storage organs is poorly characterized, and its function is not well understood. Here, we report on the characterization of starch turnover during flower, early embryo, and silique development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a combined clearing-staining technique on whole-mount tissue. Besides the two previously documented waves of transient starch accumulation in the stamen envelope, occurring during meiosis and pollen mitosis I, we identified a novel, third wave of starch amylogenesis/amylolysis during the last stages of stamen development. To gain insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, we analyzed publicly available microarray data, which revealed a developmentally coordinated expression of carbohydrate transport and metabolism genes during these waves of transient starch accumulation. Based on this analysis, we characterized starch dynamics in mutants affecting hexose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e metabolism and translocation, and identified the Glc-6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e antiporter GPT1 as the putative translocator of Glc-6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e for starch biosynthesis in reproductive tissues. Based on these results, we propose a model of starch synthesis within the pollen grain and discuss the nutrient transport route feeding the embryo within the developing seed.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death. These processes are regulated by the VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN (VND) transcription factors. Here, to identify changes in metabolism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 suspension culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target metabolome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 metabolites showed dynamic changes in metabolites related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong> biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong>s accumulated, including the shikimate-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong>s and the translocatable nitrogen-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong> arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphat</span></strong>e and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary metabolism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these metabolic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary metabolism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s metabolic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.</p>

Protective Effects of Ticagrelor on Myocardial Injury After Infarction

We aimed to investigate whether ticagrelor reduces myocardial injury to a greater extent than clopidogrel after myocardial infarction (MI) at a similar level of platelet inhibition and to determine the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pigs received the following before MI induction: (1) placebo-control; (2) a loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg); (3) a loading dose of ticagrelor (180 mg); or (4) a loading dose of ticagrelor followed by an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e A1/A2-receptor antagonist [8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline, 4 mg/kg intravenous] to determine the potential contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e in ticagrelor-related cardioprotection. Animals received the corresponding maintenance doses of the antiplatelet agents during the following 24 hours and underwent 3T-cardiac MRI analysis. Platelet inhibition was monitored by ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In the myocardium, we assessed the expression and activation of proteins known to modulate edema formation, including aquaporin-4 and AMP-activated protein kinase and its downstream effectors CD36 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Clopidogrel and ticagrelor exerted a high and consistent antiplatelet effect (68.2% and 62.2% of platelet inhibition, respectively, on challenge with 20 μmol/L ADP) that persisted up to 24 hours post-MI (<i>P</i><0.05). All groups showed comparable myocardial area-at-risk and cardiac worsening after MI induction. 3T-Cardiac MRI analysis revealed that clopidogrel- and ticagrelor-treated animals had a significantly smaller extent of MI than placebo-control animals (15.7 g left ventricle and 12.0 g left ventricle versus 22.8 g left ventricle, respectively). Yet, ticagrelor reduced infarct size to a significantly greater extent than clopidogrel (further 23.5% reduction; <i>P</i>=0.0026), an effect supported by troponin-I assessment and histopathologic analysis (<i>P</i>=0.0021). Furthermore, in comparison with clopidogrel, ticagrelor significantly diminished myocardial edema by 24.5% (<i>P</i>=0.004), which correlated with infarct mass (<i>r</i>=0.73; <i>P</i><0.001). 8-(<i>p</i>-Sulfophenyl)theophylline administration abolished the cardioprotective effects of ticagrelor over clopidogrel. At a molecular level, aquaporin-4 expression decreased and the expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling and cyclooxygenase-2 increased in the ischemic myocardium of ticagrelor- versus clopidogrel-treated animals (<i>P</i><0.05).

Restoring auditory cortex plasticity in adult mice by restricting thalamic adenosine signaling

The auditory cortex selectively expands neural representations of enriched acoustic stimuli, a process important for human language acquisition. Adults lack this plasticity. Here we show in the murine auditory cortex that juvenile plasticity can be reestablished in adulthood if acoustic stimuli are paired with disruption of ecto-5′-nucleotidase–dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e production or A<sub>1</sub>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenosin</span></strong>e receptor signaling in the auditory thalamus.

Phosphate Starvation Alters Abiotic-Stress-Induced Cytosolic Free Calcium Increases in Roots
<p>Phosphate (Pi) deficiency strongly limits plant growth, and plant roots foraging the soil for nutrients need to adapt to optimize Pi uptake. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is known to signal in root development and adaptation but has to be tightly controlled, as it is highly toxic to Pi metabolism. Under Pi starvation and the resulting decreased cellular Pi pool, the use of cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>) as a signal transducer may therefore have to be altered. Employing aequorin-expressing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we show that Pi starvation, but not nitrogen starvation, strongly dampens the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> increases evoked by mechanical, salt, osmotic, and oxidative stress as well as by extracellular nucleotides. The altered root [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response to extracellular ATP manifests during seedling development under chronic Pi deprivation but can be reversed by Pi resupply. Employing ratiometric imaging, we delineate that Pi-starved roots have a normal response to extracellular ATP at the apex but show a strongly dampened [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response in distal parts of the root tip, correlating with high reactive oxygen species levels induced by Pi starvation. Excluding iron, as well as Pi, rescues this altered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> response and restores reactive oxygen species levels to those seen under nutrient-replete conditions. These results indicate that, while Pi availability does not seem to be signaled through [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub>, Pi starvation strongly affects stress-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> signatures. These data reveal how plants can integrate nutritional and environmental cues, adding another layer of complexity to the use of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a signal transducer.</p>

Hospital Variation in Time to Epinephrine for Nonshockable In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>For patients with in-hospital cardiac arrests attributable to nonshockable rhythms, delays in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration beyond 5 minutes is associated with worse survival. However, the extent of hospital variation in delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration and its effect on hospital-level outcomes is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Within Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation, we identified 103 932 adult patients (≥18 years) at 548 hospitals with an in-hospital cardiac arrest attributable to a nonshockable rhythm who received at least 1 dose of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e between 2000 and 2014. We constructed 2-level hierarchical regression models to quantify hospital variation in rates of delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration (>5 minutes) and its association with hospital rates of survival to discharge and survival with functional recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 13 213 (12.7%) patients had delays to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e, and this rate varied markedly across hospitals (range, 0%–53.8%). The odds of delay in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration were 58% higher at 1 randomly selected hospital in comparison with a similar patient at another randomly selected hospital (median odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.51–1.64). The median risk-standardized survival rate was 12.0% (range, 5.4%–31.9%), and the risk-standardized survival with functional recovery was 7.4% (range, 0.9%–30.8%). There was an inverse correlation between a hospital’s rate of delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration and its risk-standardized rate of survival to discharge (ρ=–0.22, <i>P</i><0.0001) and survival with functional recovery (ρ=–0.14, <i>P</i>=0.001). In comparison with a median survival rate of 12.9% (interquartile range, 11.1%–15.4%) at hospitals in the lowest quartile of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e delay, risk-standardized survival was 16% lower at hospitals in the quartile with the highest rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e delays (10.8%; interquartile range, 9.7%–12.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Delays in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration following in-hospital cardiac arrest are common and variy across hospitals. Hospitals with high rates of delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration had lower rates of overall survival for in-hospital cardiac arrest attributable to nonshockable rhythm. Further studies are needed to determine whether improving hospital performance on time to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration, especially at hospitals with poor performance on this metric, will lead to improved outcomes.</p></sec>

Time to Epinephrine Administration and Survival From Nonshockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Among Children and Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that earlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration is associated with improved survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable initial rhythms. However, the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e timing on patients with nonshockable initial rhythms is unclear. The objective of this study was to measure the association between time to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration and survival in adults and children with emergency medical services (EMS)–treated OHCA with nonshockable initial rhythms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of OHCAs prospectively identified by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium network from June 4, 2011, to June 30, 2015. We included patients of all ages with an EMS-treated OHCA and an initial nonshockable rhythm. We excluded those with return of spontaneous circulation in <10 minutes. We conducted a subgroup analysis involving patients <18 years of age. The primary exposure was time (minutes) from arrival of the first EMS agency to the first dose of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e. Secondary exposure was time to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e dichotomized as early (<10 minutes) or late (≥10 minutes). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. We adjusted for Utstein covariates and Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium study site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 55 568 EMS-treated OHCAs, 32 101 patients with initial nonshockable rhythms were included. There were 12 238 in the early group, 14 517 in the late group, and 5346 not treated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e. After adjusting for potential confounders, each minute from EMS arrival to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration was associated with a 4% decrease in odds of survival for adults, odds ratio=0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.98). A subgroup analysis (n=13 290) examining neurological outcomes showed a similar association (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94 per minute; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.98). When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e was given late in comparison with early, odds of survival were 18% lower (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.98). In a pediatric analysis (n=595), odds of survival were 9% lower (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.01) for each minute delay in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among OHCAs with nonshockable initial rhythms, the majority of patients were administered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e >10 minutes after EMS arrival. Each minute delay in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration was associated with decreased survival and unfavorable neurological outcomes. EMS agencies should consider strategies to reduce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e administration times in patients with initial nonshockable rhythms.</p></sec>

Experimentally Increasing Titin Compliance in a Novel Mouse Model Attenuates the Frank-Starling Mechanism But Has a Beneficial Effect on Diastole
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Experimentally upregulating compliant titins has been suggested as a therapeutic for lowering pathological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic stiffness levels. However, how increasing titin compliance impacts global cardiac function requires in-depth study. We investigate the effect of upregulating compliant titins in a novel mouse model with a genetically altered titin splicing factor; integrative approaches were used from intact cardiomyocyte mechanics to pressure-volume analysis and Doppler echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Compliant titins were upregulated through deletion of the RNA Recognition Motif of the splicing factor RBM20 (<i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup>mice). A genome-wide exon expression analysis and a candidate approach revealed that the phenotype is likely to be dominated by greatly increased lengths of titin’s spring elements. At both cardiomyocyte and left ventricular chamber levels, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic stiffness was reduced in heterozygous (+/−) <i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup>mice with a further reduction in homozygous (−/−) mice at only the intact myocyte level. Fibrosis was present in only −/− <i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup> hearts. The Frank-Starling Mechanism was reduced in a graded fashion in <i>Rbm20</i><sup><i>ΔRRM</i></sup> mice, at both the cardiomyocyte and left ventricular chamber levels. Exercise tests revealed an increase in exercise capacity in +/− mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Titin is not only important in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic but also in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic cardiac function. Upregulating compliant titins reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic chamber stiffness owing to the increased compliance of myocytes, but it depresses end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic elastance; under conditions of exercise, the beneficial effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function dominate. Therapeutic manipulation of the RBM20-based splicing system might be able to minimize effects on fibrosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic function while improving the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function in patients with heart failure.</p></sec>

Effect of Childhood Obesity Prevention Programs on Blood Pressure
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Childhood overweight and obesity are associated with elevated blood pressure (BP). However, little is known about how childhood obesity lifestyle prevention programs affect BP. We assessed the effects of childhood obesity prevention programs on BP in children in developed countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We searched databases up to April 22, 2013, for relevant randomized, controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and natural experiments. Studies were included if they applied a diet or physical activity intervention(s) and were followed for ≥1 year (or ≥6 months for school-based intervention studies); they were excluded if they targeted only overweight/obese subjects or those with a medical condition. In our meta-analysis, intervention effects were calculated for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic BP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP with the use of weighted random-effects models. Of the 23 included intervention studies (involving 18 925 participants), 21 involved a school setting. Our meta-analysis included 19 studies reporting on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic BP and 18 on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP. The pooled intervention effect was −1.64 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −2.56 to −0.71; <i>P</i>=0.001) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic BP and −1.44 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −2.28 to −0.60; <i>P</i>=0.001) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP. The combined diet and physical activity interventions led to a significantly greater reduction in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic BP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP than the diet-only or physical activity–only intervention. Thirteen interventions (46%) had a similar effect on both adiposity-related outcomes and BP, whereas 11 interventions (39%) showed a significant desirable effect on BP but not on adiposity-related outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Obesity prevention programs have a moderate effect on reducing BP, and those targeting both diet and physical activity seem to be more effective.</p></sec>

Association Between Prompt Defibrillation and Epinephrine Treatment With Long-Term Survival After In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prior studies have reported higher in-hospital survival with prompt defibrillation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e treatment in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Whether this survival benefit persists after discharge is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We linked data from a national IHCA registry with Medicare files and identified 36 961 patients ≥65 years of age with an IHCA at 517 hospitals between 2000 and 2011. Patients with IHCA caused by pulseless ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tachycardia</span></strong> or ventricular fibrillation were stratified by prompt (≤2 minutes) versus delayed (>2 minutes) defibrillation, whereas patients with IHCA caused by a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>e or pulseless electric activity were stratified by prompt (≤5 minutes) versus delayed (>5 minutes) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epinephrin</span></strong>e treatment. The association between prompt treatment and long-term survival for each rhythm type was assessed with multivariable hierarchical modified Poisson regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 8119 patients with an IHCA caused by ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tachycardia</span></strong> or ventricular fibrillation, the rate of 1-year survival was higher in those treated with prompt defibrillation than with delayed defibrillation (25.7% [1466 of 5714] versus 15.5% [373 of 2405]; adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32–1.69; <i>P</i><0.0001).

Association Between Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Blood Pressure Among Adults in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of sodium and lower levels of potassium intake are associated with higher blood pressure. However, the shape and magnitude of these associations can vary by study participant characteristics or intake assessment method. Twenty-four–hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium are unaffected by recall errors and represent all sources of intake, and were collected for the first time in a nationally representative US survey. Our objective was to assess the associations of blood pressure and hypertension with 24-hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium among US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cross-sectional data were obtained from 766 participants age 20 to 69 years with complete blood pressure and 24-hour urine collections in the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the US noninstitutionalized population. Usual 24-hour urinary electrolyte excretion (sodium, potassium, and their ratio) was estimated from ≤2 collections on nonconsecutive days, adjusting for day-to-day variability in excretion. Outcomes included <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic blood pressure from the average of 3 measures and hypertension status, based on average blood pressure ≥140/90 and antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After multivariable adjustment, each 1000-mg difference in usual 24-hour sodium excretion was directly associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic (4.58 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.64–6.51) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic (2.25 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.83–3.67) blood pressures. Each 1000-mg difference in potassium excretion was inversely associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic blood pressure (–3.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, –6.01 to –1.42). Each 0.5 U difference in sodium-to-potassium ratio was directly associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic blood pressure (1.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.76–2.68). Hypertension was linearly associated with progressively higher sodium and lower potassium excretion; in comparison with the lowest quartile of excretion, the adjusted odds of hypertension for the highest quartile was 4.22 (95% CI, 1.36–13.15) for sodium, and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.17–0.87) for potassium (<i>P</i><0.01 for trends).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These cross-sectional results show a strong dose-response association between urinary sodium excretion and blood pressure, and an inverse association between urinary potassium excretion and blood pressure, in a nationally representative sample of US adults.</p></sec>

We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these measures using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each measure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-based cut points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function.

Heart Failure Stages Among Older Adults in the Community
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects older adults, little data exist regarding the prevalence of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF stages among older individuals in the community. Additionally, the role of contemporary measures of longitudinal strain and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic dysfunction in defining HF stages is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HF stages were classified in 6118 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (67–91 years of age) at the fifth study visit as follows: A (asymptomatic with HF risk factors but no cardiac structural or functional abnormalities), B (asymptomatic with structural abnormalities, defined as left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or dysfunction, or significant valvular disease), C1 (clinical HF without prior hospitalization), and C2 (clinical HF with earlier hospitalization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using the traditional definitions of HF stages, only 5% of examined participants were free of HF risk factors or structural heart disease (Stage 0), 52% were categorized as Stage A, 30% Stage B, 7% Stage C1, and 6% Stage C2. Worse HF stage was associated with a greater risk of incident HF hospitalization or death at a median follow-up of 608 days. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the sample from Stage A to B and improved the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV structure, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic function (based on LV ejection fraction and longitudinal strain), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with risk of incident HF hospitalization or death in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at risk for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based samples.

PIEZOs mediate neuronal sensing of blood pressure and the baroreceptor reflex
<p>Activation of stretch-sensitive baroreceptor neurons exerts acute control over heart rate and blood pressure. Although this homeostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> has been described for more than 80 years, the molecular identity of baroreceptor mechanosensitivity remains unknown. We discovered that mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are together required for baroreception. Genetic ablation of both <i>Piezo1</i> and <i>Piezo2</i> in the nodose and petrosal sensory ganglia of mice abolished drug-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> and aortic depressor nerve activity. Awake, behaving animals that lack <i>Piezos</i> had labile hypertension and increased blood pressure variability, consistent with phenotypes in baroreceptor-denervated animals and humans with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> failure. Optogenetic activation of <i>Piezo2</i>-positive sensory afferents was sufficient to initiate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">baroreflex</span></strong> in mice. These findings suggest that PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are the long-sought baroreceptor mechanosensors critical for acute blood pressure control.</p>

The mechanisms of ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>s (VA) were probed by optical mapping, whole-cell patch clamp to measure action potential duration and ionic currents, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to investigate changes in ion channel expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After 7 weeks of a high-salt diet, 31 of 38 rats showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction along with signs of heart failure and hence were diagnosed with HFpEF. Programmed electric stimulation demonstrated increased susceptibility to VA in HFpEF rats (<i>P</i><0.001 versus controls). The arrhythmogenicity index was increased (<i>P</i><0.001) and the corrected QT interval on ECG was prolonged (<i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF rats. Optical mapping of HFpEF hearts demonstrated prolonged action potentials (<i>P</i><0.05) and multiple reentry circuits during induced VA. Single-cell recordings of cardiomyocytes isolated from HFpEF rats confirmed a delay of repolarization (<i>P</i>=0.001) and revealed downregulation of transient outward potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>; <i>P</i><0.05). The rapid components of the delayed rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>Kr</sub>) and the inward rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>K1</sub>) were also downregulated (<i>P</i><0.05), but the current densities were much lower than for <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>. In accordance with the reduction of <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>, both <i>Kcnd3</i> transcript and Kv4.3 protein levels were decreased in HFpEF rat hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Susceptibility to VA was markedly increased in rats with HFpEF. Underlying abnormalities include QT prolongation, delayed repolarization from downregulation of potassium currents, and multiple reentry circuits during VA. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that potassium current downregulation leads to abnormal repolarization in HFpEF, which in turn predisposes to VA and sudden cardiac death.</p></sec>

Brain Emboli After Left Ventricular Endocardial Ablation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Catheter ablation for ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tachycardia</span></strong> and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) is common. Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation is associated with a risk of cerebral emboli attributed to cardioversions and numerous ablation lesions in the low-flow left atrium, but cerebral embolic risk in ventricular ablation has not been evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We enrolled 18 consecutive patients meeting study criteria scheduled for ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tachycardia</span></strong> or PVC ablation over a 9-month period. Patients undergoing left ventricular (LV) ablation were compared with a control group of those undergoing right ventricular ablation only. Patients were excluded if they had implantable cardioverter defibrillators or permanent pacemakers. Radiofrequency energy was used for ablation in all cases and heparin was administered with goal-activated clotting times of 300 to 400 seconds for all LV procedures. Pre- and postprocedural brain MRI was performed on each patient within a week of the ablation procedure. Embolic infarcts were defined as new foci of reduced diffusion and high signal intensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery brain MRI within a vascular distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 58 years, half of the patients were men, half had a history of hypertension, and the majority had no known vascular disease or heart failure. LV ablation was performed in 12 patients (ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tachycardia</span></strong>, n=2; PVC, n=10) and right ventricular ablation was performed exclusively in 6 patients (ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tachycardia</span></strong>, n=1; PVC, n=5). Seven patients (58%) undergoing LV ablation experienced a total of 16 cerebral emboli, in comparison with zero patients undergoing right ventricular ablation (<i>P</i>=0.04). Seven of 11 patients (63%) undergoing a retrograde approach to the LV developed at least 1 new brain lesion.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>More than half of patients undergoing routine LV ablation procedures (predominately PVC ablations) experienced new brain emboli after the procedure. Future research is critical to understanding the long-term consequences of these lesions and to determining optimal strategies to avoid them.</p></sec>

Stress-Activated Kinase Mitogen-Activated Kinase Kinase-7 Governs Epigenetics of Cardiac Repolarization for Arrhythmia Prevention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong> is a leading cause of cardiac mortality. Most antiarrhythmics present paradoxical proarrhythmic side effects, culminating in a greater risk of sudden death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We describe a new regulatory mechanism linking mitogen-activated kinase kinase-7 deficiency with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong> vulnerability in hypertrophied and failing hearts using mouse models harboring mitogen-activated kinase kinase-7 knockout or overexpression. The human relevance of this arrhythmogenic mechanism is evaluated in human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes. Therapeutic potentials by targeting this mechanism are explored in the mouse models and human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mechanistically, hypertrophic stress dampens expression and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated kinase kinase-7. Such mitogen-activated kinase kinase-7 deficiency leaves histone deacetylase-2 unphosphorylated and filamin-A accumulated in the nucleus to form a complex with Krüppel-like factor-4. This complex leads to Krüppel-like factor-4 disassociation from the promoter regions of multiple key potassium channel genes (Kv4.2, KChIP2, Kv1.5, ERG1, and Kir6.2) and reduction of their transcript levels. Consequent repolarization delays result in ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>s. Therapeutically, targeting the repressive function of the Krüppel-like factor-4/histone deacetylase-2/filamin-A complex with the histone deacetylase-2 inhibitor valproic acid restores K<sup>+</sup> channel expression and alleviates ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>s in pathologically remodeled hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings unveil this new gene regulatory avenue as a new antiarrhythmic target where repurposing of the antiepileptic drug valproic acid as an antiarrhythmic is supported.</p></sec>

Atrial Fibrillation and Ventricular Arrhythmias
<p>Sex-specific differences in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF), sustained ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>s, and sudden cardiac death are recognized. Sex hormones cause differences in cardiac electrophysiological parameters between men and women that may affect the risk for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>s. The incidence and prevalence of AF is lower in women than in men. However, because women live longer and AF prevalence increases with age, the absolute number of women with AF exceeds that of men. Women with AF are more symptomatic, present with more atypical symptoms, and report worse quality of life in comparison with men. Female sex is an independent risk factor for death or stroke attributable to AF. Oral anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention has similar efficacy for men and women, but older women treated with warfarin have a higher residual risk of stroke in comparison with men. Women with AF are less likely to receive rhythm control antiarrhythmic drug therapy, electric cardioversion, or catheter ablation in comparison with men. The incidence and prevalence of sustained ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>s and sudden cardiac death are lower in women than in men. Women receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillators for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death are less likely to experience sustained ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>s in comparison with men. In contrast, women receiving a cardiac resynchronization therapy implantable cardioverter defibrillator for the treatment of heart failure are more likely to benefit than men. Women are less likely to be referred for implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy despite current guideline recommendations. Women are more likely to experience a significant complication related to implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation in comparison with men. Whether sex differences in treatment decisions reflect patient preferences or treatment biases requires further study.</p>

Association of Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Venous Thromboembolism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Much controversy surrounds the association of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors with venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an individual level random-effect meta-analysis including 9 prospective studies with measured baseline cardiovascular disease risk factors and validated VTE events. Definitions were harmonized across studies. Traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors were modeled categorically and continuously using restricted cubic splines. Estimates were obtained for overall VTE, provoked VTE (ie, VTE occurring in the presence of 1 or more established VTE risk factors), and unprovoked VTE, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The studies included 244 865 participants with 4910 VTE events occurring during a mean follow-up of 4.7 to 19.7 years per study. Age, sex, and body mass index-adjusted hazard ratios for overall VTE were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89−1.07) for hypertension, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88−1.08) for hyperlipidemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89−1.15) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08−1.32) for current smoking. After full adjustment, these estimates were numerically similar. When modeled continuously, an inverse association was observed for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic blood pressure (hazard ratio=0.79 [95% CI: 0.68−0.92] at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic blood pressure 160 vs 110 mm Hg) but not for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic blood pressure or lipid measures with VTE. An important finding from VTE subtype analyses was that cigarette smoking was associated with provoked but not unprovoked VTE. Fully adjusted hazard ratios for the associations of current smoking with provoked and unprovoked VTE were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.22−1.52) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.90−1.29), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Except for the association between cigarette smoking and provoked VTE, which is potentially mediated through comorbid conditions such as cancer, the modifiable traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors are not associated with increased VTE risk. Higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic blood pressure showed an inverse association with VTE.</p></sec>

Clinic Blood Pressure Underestimates Ambulatory Blood Pressure in an Untreated Employer-Based US Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) is consistently superior to clinic blood pressure (CBP) as a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk. A common perception is that ABP is usually lower than CBP. The relationship of the CBP minus ABP difference to age has not been examined in the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between 2005 and 2012, 888 healthy, employed, middle-aged (mean±SD age, 45±10.4 years) individuals (59% female, 7.4% black, 12% Hispanic) with screening BP <160/105 mm Hg and not taking antihypertensive medication completed 3 separate clinic BP assessments and a 24-hour ABP recording for the Masked Hypertension Study. The distributions of CBP, mean awake ABP (aABP), and the CBP−aABP difference in the full sample and by demographic characteristics were compared. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing was used to model the relationship of the BP measures to age and body mass index. The prevalence of discrepancies in ABP- versus CBP-defined hypertension status—white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension—were also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic aABP (123.0/77.4±10.3/7.4 mm Hg) was significantly higher than the average of 9 CBP readings over 3 visits (116.0/75.4±11.6/7.7 mm Hg). aABP exceeded CBP by >10 mm Hg much more frequently than CBP exceeded aABP. The difference (aABP>CBP) was most pronounced in young adults and those with normal body mass index. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic difference progressively diminished, but did not disappear, at older ages and higher body mass indexes. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic difference vanished around age 65 and reversed (CBP>aABP) for body mass index >32.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Whereas 5.3% of participants were hypertensive by CBP, 19.2% were hypertensive by aABP; 15.7% of those with nonelevated CBP had masked hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Contrary to a widely held belief, based primarily on cohort studies of patients with elevated CBP, ABP is not usually lower than CBP, at least not among healthy, employed individuals. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of otherwise healthy individuals with nonelevated CBP have masked hypertension. Demonstrated CBP−aABP gradients, if confirmed in representative samples (eg, NHANES [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]), could provide guidance for primary care physicians as to when, for a given CBP, 24-hour ABP would be useful to identify or rule out masked hypertension.</p></sec>

Genome- and Phenome-Wide Analyses of Cardiac Conduction Identifies Markers of Arrhythmia Risk
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>ECG QRS duration, a measure of cardiac intraventricular conduction, varies ≈2-fold in individuals without cardiac disease. Slow conduction may promote re-entrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genomic markers of QRS duration in 5272 individuals without cardiac disease selected from electronic medical record algorithms at 5 sites in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. The most significant loci were evaluated within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium QRS genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Twenty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 loci, previously described by CHARGE, were replicated in the eMERGE samples; 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were in the chromosome 3 <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>SCN10A</i> loci, where the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were rs1805126 in <i>SCN5A</i> with <i>P</i>=1.2×10<sup>−8</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=2.5×10<sup>−20</sup> (CHARGE) and rs6795970 in <i>SCN10A</i> with <i>P</i>=6×10<sup>−6</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=5×10<sup>−27</sup> (CHARGE). The other loci were in <i>NFIA</i>, near <i>CDKN1A</i>, and near <i>C6orf204.</i> We then performed phenome-wide association studies on variants in these 5 loci in 13859 European Americans to search for diagnoses associated with these markers. Phenome-wide association study identified atrial fibrillation and cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>s as the most common associated diagnoses with <i>SCN10A</i> and <i>SCN5A</i> variants. <i>SCN10A</i> variants were also associated with subsequent development of atrial fibrillation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong> in the original 5272 “heart-healthy” study population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>We conclude that DNA biobanks coupled to electronic medical records not only provide a platform for genome-wide association study but also may allow broad interrogation of the longitudinal incidence of disease associated with genetic variants. The phenome-wide association study approach implicated sodium channel variants modulating QRS duration in subjects without cardiac disease as predictors of subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>s.</p></sec>

Genetic Predisposition to High Blood Pressure and Lifestyle Factors
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Both heritable and lifestyle risk factors contribute to elevated BP levels. We aimed to investigate the extent to which lifestyle factors could offset the effect of an adverse BP genetic profile and its effect on CVD risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We constructed a genetic risk score for high BP by using 314 published BP loci in 277 005 individuals without previous CVD from the UK Biobank study, a prospective cohort of individuals aged 40 to 69 years, with a median of 6.11 years of follow-up. We scored participants according to their lifestyle factors including body mass index, healthy diet, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol consumption, smoking, and urinary sodium excretion levels measured at recruitment. We examined the association between tertiles of genetic risk and tertiles of lifestyle score with BP levels and incident CVD by using linear regression and Cox regression models, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Healthy lifestyle score was strongly associated with BP (<i>P</i><10<sup>–320</sup>) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP and CVD events regardless of the underlying BP genetic risk.

0/1-Hour Triage Algorithm for Myocardial Infarction in Patients With Renal Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The European Society of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cardiolog</span></strong>y recommends a 0/1-hour algorithm for rapid rule-out and rule-in of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentrations irrespective of renal function. Because patients with renal dysfunction (RD) frequently present with increased hs-cTn concentrations even in the absence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, concern has been raised regarding the performance of the 0/1-hour algorithm in RD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter diagnostic study enrolling unselected patients presenting with suspected non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to the emergency department, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the European Society of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cardiolog</span></strong>y 0/1-hour algorithm using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in patients with RD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and compared it to patients with normal renal function. The final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cardiolog</span></strong>ists using all available information, including cardiac imaging. Safety was quantified as sensitivity in the rule-out zone, accuracy as the specificity in the rule-in zone, and efficacy as the proportion of the overall cohort assigned to either rule-out or rule-in based on the 0- and 1-hour sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3254 patients, RD was present in 487 patients (15%). The prevalence of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was substantially higher in patients with RD compared with patients with normal renal function (31% versus 13%, <i>P</i><0.001). Using hs-cTnT, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (100.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 97.6–100.0] versus 99.2% [95% CI, 97.6–99.8]; <i>P</i>=0.559), lower specificity of rule-in (88.7% [95% CI, 84.8–91.9] versus 96.5% [95% CI, 95.7–97.2]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (51% versus 81%, <i>P</i><0.001), mainly driven by a much lower percentage of patients eligible for rule-out (18% versus 68%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function. Using hs-cTnI, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (98.6% [95% CI, 95.0–99.8] versus 98.5% [95% CI, 96.5–99.5]; <i>P</i>=1.0), lower specificity of rule-in (84.4% [95% CI, 79.9–88.3] versus 91.7% [95% CI, 90.5–92.9]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (54% versus 76%, <i>P</i><0.001; proportion ruled out, 18% versus 58%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with RD, the safety of the European Society of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cardiolog</span></strong>y 0/1-hour algorithm is high, but specificity of rule-in and overall efficacy are decreased.

Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Functions Underestimate Risk in HIV Infection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is elevated in HIV-infected individuals, with contributions from both traditional and nontraditional risk factors. The accuracy of established CVD risk prediction functions in HIV is uncertain. We sought to assess the performance of 3 established CVD risk prediction functions in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected men.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The FHS (Framingham Heart Study) functions for hard coronary heart disease (FHS CHD) and atherosclerotic CVD (FHS ASCVD) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD function were applied to the Partners HIV cohort. Risk scores were calculated between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008. Outcomes included CHD (myocardial infarction or coronary death) for the FHS CHD function and ASCVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary death) for the FHS ASCVD and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD functions. We investigated the accuracy of CVD risk prediction for each function when applied to the HIV cohort using comparison of Cox regression coefficients, discrimination, and calibration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The HIV cohort was comprised of 1272 men followed for a median of 4.4 years. There were 78 (6.1%) ASCVD events; the 5-year incidence rate was 16.4 per 1000 person-years. Discrimination was moderate to poor as indicated by the low <i>c</i> statistic (0.68 for FHS CHD, 0.65 for American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD, and 0.67 for FHS ASCVD). Observed CVD risk exceeded the predicted risk for each of the functions in most deciles of predicted risk. Calibration, or goodness of fit of the models, was consistently poor, with significant χ<sup>2</sup> <i>P</i> values for all functions. Recalibration did not significantly improve model fit.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cardiovascular risk prediction functions developed for use in the general population are inaccurate in HIV infection and systematically underestimate risk in a cohort of HIV-infected men. Development of tailored CVD risk prediction functions incorporating traditional CVD risk factors and HIV-specific factors is likely to result in more accurate risk estimation to guide preventative CVD care.</p></sec>

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. The development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention control (control; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by curve fit of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic pressure-volume curve. Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) was measured to quantify changes in fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; control: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in controls (group×time <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic volume (group×time <i>P</i><0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was unchanged, providing greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stroke volum</span></strong>e for any given filling pressure (loading×group×time <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and decreased cardiac stiffness. Regular exercise training may provide protection against the future risk of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction by preventing the increase in cardiac stiffness attributable to sedentary aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Day-to-Day Blood Pressure Variability and Risk of Dementia in a General Japanese Elderly Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Several observational studies have reported that higher visit-to-visit blood pressure variability is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. However, no studies have investigated the association of day-to-day blood pressure variability assessed by home blood pressure measurement with the development of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 1674 community-dwelling Japanese elderly without dementia, ≥60 years of age, were followed up for 5 years (2007–2012). Home blood pressure was measured 3 times every morning for a median of 28 days. Day-to-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic (SBP) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic blood pressure variabilities, calculated as coefficients of variation (CoV) of home SBP and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic blood pressure, were categorized into quartiles. The hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of the CoV levels of home blood pressure on the development of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia (VaD), and Alzheimer disease (AD) were computed with a Cox proportional hazards model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the follow-up, 194 subjects developed all-cause dementia; of these, 47 had VaD and 134 had AD. The age- and sex-adjusted incidences of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD increased significantly with increasing CoV levels of home SBP (all <i>P</i> for trend <0.05). These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including home SBP. Compared with subjects in the first quartile of CoV levels of home SBP, the risks of the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD were significantly higher in those in the fourth quartile (hazard ratio=2.27, 95% confidence interval=1.45–3.55, <i>P</i><0.001 for all-cause dementia; hazard ratio=2.79, 95% confidence interval=1.04–7.51, <i>P</i>=0.03 for VaD; hazard ratio=2.22, 95% confidence interval=1.31–3.75, <i>P</i><0.001 for AD). Similar associations were observed for CoV levels of home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic blood pressure. Meanwhile, home SBP levels were significantly associated with the risk of VaD but not with the risks of all-cause dementia and AD. There was no interaction between home SBP levels and CoV levels of home SBP on the risk of each subtype of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that increased day-to-day blood pressure variability is, independently of average home blood pressure, a significant risk factor for the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD in the general elderly Japanese population.</p></sec>

Age and Outcomes of Primary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The DANISH study (Danish Study to Assess the Efficacy of ICDs [Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators] in Patients With Non-Ischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic Heart Failure on Mortality) did not demonstrate an overall effect on all-cause mortality with ICD implantation. However, the prespecified subgroup analysis suggested a possible age-dependent association between ICD implantation and mortality with survival benefit seen only in the youngest patients. The nature of this relationship between age and outcome of a primary prevention ICD in patients with nonischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic heart failure warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All 1116 patients from the DANISH study were included in this prespecified subgroup analysis. We assessed the relationship between ICD implantation and mortality by age, and an optimal age cutoff was estimated nonparametrically with selection impact curves. Modes of death were divided into sudden cardiac death and nonsudden death and compared between patients younger and older than this age cutoff with the use of χ<sup>2</sup> analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Median age of the study population was 63 years (range, 21–84 years). There was a linearly decreasing relationship between ICD and mortality with age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.003–1.06; <i>P</i>=0.03). An optimal age cutoff for ICD implantation was present at ≤70 years. There was an association between reduced all-cause mortality and ICD in patients ≤70 years of age (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51–0.96; <i>P</i>=0.03) but not in patients >70 years of age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.68–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.84). For patients ≤70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3–2.5) and nonsudden death rate was 2.7 (95% CI, 2.1–3.5) events per 100 patient-years, whereas for patients >70 years old, the sudden cardiac death rate was 1.6 (95% CI, 0.8–3.2) and nonsudden death rate was 5.4 (95% CI, 3.7–7.8) events per 100 patient-years. This difference in modes of death between the 2 age groups was statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic heart failure not caused by ischemic heart disease, the association between the ICD and survival decreased linearly with increasing age.

Immediate and Midterm Cardiac Remodeling After Surgical Pulmonary Valve Replacement in Adults With Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot provides symptomatic benefit and right ventricular (RV) volume reduction. However, data on the rate of ventricular structural and functional adaptation are scarce. We aimed to assess immediate and midterm post-PVR changes and predictors of reverse remoeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Fifty-seven patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (age ≥16 y; mean age, 35.8±10.1 y; 38 male) undergoing PVR were prospectively recruited for cardiovascular magnetic resonance performed before PVR (pPVR), immediately after PVR (median, 6 d), and midterm after PVR (mPVR; median, 3 y).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were immediate and midterm reductions in indexed RV end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic volumes and RV end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic volumes (RVESVi) (indexed RV end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic volume pPVR versus immediately after PVR versus mPVR, 156.1±41.9 versus 104.9±28.4 versus 104.2±34.4 mL/m<sup>2</sup>; RVESVi pPVR versus immediately after PVR versus mPVR, 74.9±26.2 versus 57.4±22.7 versus 50.5±21.7 mL/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.01). Normal postoperative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic RV volumes (the primary end point) achieved in 70% of patients were predicted by a preoperative indexed RV end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic volume ≤158 mL/m<sup>2</sup> and RVESVi ≤82 mL/m<sup>2</sup>. RVESVi showed a progressive decrease from baseline to immediate to midterm follow-up, indicating ongoing intrinsic RV functional improvement after PVR. Left ventricular ejection fraction improved (pPVR versus mPVR, 59.4±7.6% versus 61.9±6.8%; <i>P</i><0.01), and right atrial reverse remodeling occurred (pPVR versus mPVR, 15.2±3.4 versus 13.8±3.6 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.01). Larger preoperative RV outflow tract scar was associated with a smaller improvement in post-PVR RV/left ventricular ejection fraction. RV ejection fraction and peak oxygen uptake predicted mortality (<i>P</i>=0.03) over a median of 9.5 years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant right heart structural reverse remodeling takes place immediately after PVR, followed by a continuing process of further biological remodeling manifested by further reduction in RVESVi. PVR before RVESVi reaches 82 mL/m<sup>2</sup> confers optimal chances of normalization of RV function.</p></sec>

High-Intensity Interval Training in Patients With Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Small studies have suggested that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is superior to moderate continuous training (MCT) in reversing cardiac remodeling and increasing aerobic capacity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The present multicenter trial compared 12 weeks of supervised interventions of HIIT, MCT, or a recommendation of regular exercise (RRE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Two hundred sixty-one patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% and New York Heart Association class II to III were randomly assigned to HIIT at 90% to 95% of maximal heart rate, MCT at 60% to 70% of maximal heart rate, or RRE. Thereafter, patients were encouraged to continue exercising on their own. Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, after the intervention, and at follow-up after 52 weeks. Primary end point was a between-group comparison of change in left ventricular end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic diameter from baseline to 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Groups did not differ in age (median, 60 years), sex (19% women), ischemic pathogenesis (59%), or medication. Change in left ventricular end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic diameter from baseline to 12 weeks was not different between HIIT and MCT (<i>P</i>=0.45); left ventricular end-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic diameter changes compared with RRE were −2.8 mm (−5.2 to −0.4 mm; <i>P</i>=0.02) in HIIT and −1.2 mm (−3.6 to 1.2 mm; <i>P</i>=0.34) in MCT. There was also no difference between HIIT and MCT in peak oxygen uptake (<i>P</i>=0.70), but both were superior to RRE. However, none of these changes was maintained at follow-up after 52 weeks. Serious adverse events were not statistically different during supervised intervention or at follow-up at 52 weeks (HIIT, 39%; MCT, 25%; RRE, 34%; <i>P</i>=0.16).

Sex Differences in Faculty Rank Among Academic Cardiologists in the United States

Cardiovascular Toxicity of Illicit Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Use
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Millions of individuals have used illicit anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), but the long-term cardiovascular associations of these drugs remain incompletely understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using a cross-sectional cohort design, we recruited 140 experienced male weightlifters 34 to 54 years of age, comprising 86 men reporting ≥2 years of cumulative lifetime AAS use and 54 nonusing men. Using transthoracic echocardiography and coronary computed tomography angiography, we assessed 3 primary outcome measures: left ventricular (LV) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic function (left ventricular ejection fraction), LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function (early relaxation velocity), and coronary atherosclerosis (coronary artery plaque volume).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with nonusers, AAS users demonstrated relatively reduced LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic function (mean±SD left ventricular ejection fraction = 52±11% versus 63±8%; <i>P</i><0.001) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic function (early relaxation velocity = 9.3±2.4 cm/second versus 11.1±2.0 cm/second; <i>P</i><0.001).

We compared the European Society of Cardiology pathway (<99th centile at presentation or at 3 hours if symptoms <6 hours) with a pathway developed in the High-STEACS study (High-Sensitivity Troponin in the Evaluation of Patients With Acute Coronary <i>S</i>yndrome) population (<5 ng/L at presentation or change <3 ng/L and <99th centile at 3 hours). The primary outcome was a comparison of the negative predictive value of both pathways for index type 1 myocardial infarction or type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. We evaluated the primary outcome in prespecified subgroups stratified by age, sex, time of symptom onset, and known ischemic heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The primary outcome occurred in 15.7% (191 of 1218) patients.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Fetal Cardiac Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The goal of this statement is to review available literature and to put forth a scientific statement on the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis and management of fetal cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association reviewed the available literature pertaining to topics relevant to fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>s, assessment of cardiac function and the cardiovascular system, and available treatment options. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal diagnosis, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical management for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>s or heart failure and closed or open intervention for diseases affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention strategies to prevent the progression of disease in utero are also discussed. Recommendations for delivery planning strategies for fetuses with congenital heart disease including models based on classification of disease severity and delivery room treatment will be highlighted. Outcome assessment is reviewed to show the benefit of prenatal diagnosis and management as they affect outcome for babies with congenital heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Fetal cardiac medicine has evolved considerably over the past 2 decades, predominantly in response to advances in imaging technology and innovations in therapies. The diagnosis of cardiac disease in the fetus is mostly made with ultrasound; however, new technologies, including 3- and 4-dimensional echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal electrocardiography and magnetocardiography, are available. Medical and interventional treatments for select diseases and strategies for delivery room care enable stabilization of high-risk fetuses and contribute to improved outcomes. This statement highlights what is currently known and recommended on the basis of evidence and experience in the rapidly advancing and highly specialized field of fetal cardiac care.</p></sec>

The Global Cardiovascular Risk Transition
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>It is commonly assumed that cardiovascular disease risk factors are associated with affluence and Westernization. We investigated the associations of body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic blood pressure, and serum total cholesterol with national income, Western diet, and, for BMI, urbanization in 1980 and 2008.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Country-level risk factor estimates for 199 countries between 1980 and 2008 were from a previous systematic analysis of population-based data. We analyzed the associations between risk factors and per capita national income, a measure of Western diet, and, for BMI, the percentage of the population living in urban areas. In 1980, there was a positive association between national income and population mean BMI, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic blood pressure, and total cholesterol. By 2008, the slope of the association between national income and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic blood pressure became negative for women and zero for men. Total cholesterol was associated with national income and Western diet in both 1980 and 2008. In 1980, BMI rose with national income and then flattened at ≈Int$7000; by 2008, the relationship resembled an inverted U for women, peaking at middle-income levels. BMI had a positive relationship with the percentage of urban population in both 1980 and 2008. Fasting plasma glucose had weaker associations with these country macro characteristics, but it was positively associated with BMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The changing associations of metabolic risk factors with macroeconomic variables indicate that there will be a global pandemic of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, together with high blood pressure in low-income countries, unless effective lifestyle and pharmacological interventions are implemented.</p></sec>

Effects of Bariatric Surgery in Obese Patients With Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent research efforts on bariatric surgery have focused on metabolic and diabetes mellitus resolution. Randomized trials designed to assess the impact of bariatric surgery in patients with obesity and hypertension are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this randomized, single-center, nonblinded trial, we included patients with hypertension (using ≥2 medications at maximum doses or >2 at moderate doses) and a body mass index between 30.0 and 39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Patients were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone. The primary end point was reduction of ≥30% of the total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic blood pressure <140 mm Hg and 90 mm Hg, respectively, at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 100 patients (70% female, mean age 43.8±9.2 years, mean body mass index 36.9±2.7 kg/m2), and 96% completed follow-up. Reduction of ≥30% of the total number of antihypertensive medications while maintaining controlled blood pressure occurred in 41 of 49 patients from the gastric bypass group (83.7%) compared with 6 of 47 patients (12.8%) from the control group with a rate ratio of 6.6 (95% confidence interval, 3.1–14.0; <i>P</i><0.001). Remission of hypertension was present in 25 of 49 (51%) and 22 of 48 (45.8%) patients randomized to gastric bypass, considering office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, respectively, whereas no patient submitted to medical therapy was free of antihypertensive drugs at 12 months. A post hoc analysis for the primary end point considering the SPRINT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) target reached consistent results, with a rate ratio of 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.4–10.6; <i>P</i>=0.005). Eleven patients (22.4%) from the gastric bypass group and none in the control group were able to achieve SPRINT levels without antihypertensives. Waist circumference, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, glycohemoglobin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and 10-year Framingham risk score were lower in the gastric bypass than in the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Bariatric surgery represents an effective strategy for blood pressure control in a broad population of patients with obesity and hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Genetic Predisposition, Clinical Risk Factor Burden, and Lifetime Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The long-term probability of developing atrial fibrillation (AF) considering genetic predisposition and clinical risk factor burden is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We estimated the lifetime risk of AF in individuals from the community-based Framingham Heart Study. Polygenic risk for AF was derived using a score of ≈1000 AF-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Clinical risk factor burden was calculated for each individual using a validated risk score for incident AF comprised of height, weight, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic blood pressure, current smoking status, antihypertensive medication use, diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction, and history of heart failure. We estimated the lifetime risk of AF within tertiles of polygenic and clinical risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 4606 participants without AF at 55 years of age, 580 developed incident AF (median follow-up, 9.4 years; 25th–75th percentile, 4.4–14.3 years). The lifetime risk of AF >55 years of age was 37.1% and was substantially influenced by both polygenic and clinical risk factor burden. Among individuals free of AF at 55 years of age, those in low-polygenic and clinical risk tertiles had a lifetime risk of AF of 22.3% (95% confidence interval, 15.4−9.1), whereas those in high-risk tertiles had a risk of 48.2% (95% confidence interval, 41.3−55.1). A lower clinical risk factor burden was associated with later AF onset after adjusting for genetic predisposition (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In our community-based cohort, the lifetime risk of AF was 37%. Estimation of polygenic AF risk is feasible and together with clinical risk factor burden explains a substantial gradient in long-term AF risk.</p></sec>

International External Validation Study of the 2014 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on Sudden Cardiac Death Prevention in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (EVIDENCE-HCM)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Identification of people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) who are at risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and require a prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator is challenging. In 2014, the European Society of Cardiology proposed a new risk stratification method based on a risk prediction model (HCM Risk-SCD) that estimates the 5-year risk of SCD. The aim was to externally validate the 2014 European Society of Cardiology recommendations in a geographically diverse cohort of patients recruited from the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was an observational, retrospective, longitudinal cohort study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cohort consisted of 3703 patients. Seventy three (2%) patients reached the SCD end point within 5 years of follow-up (5-year incidence, 2.4% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.9–3.0]). The validation study revealed a calibration slope of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.93–1.12), C-index of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.68–0.72), and D-statistic of 1.17 (95% CI, 1.05–1.29). In a complete case analysis (n= 2147; 44 SCD end points at 5 years), patients with a predicted 5-year risk of <4% (n=1524; 71%) had an observed 5-year SCD incidence of 1.4% (95% CI, 0.8–2.2); patients with a predicted risk of ≥6% (n=297; 14%) had an observed SCD incidence of 8.9% (95% CI, 5.96–13.1) at 5 years. For every 13 (297/23) implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantations in patients with an estimated 5-year SCD risk ≥6%, 1 patient can potentially be saved from SCD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study confirms that the HCM Risk-SCD model provides accurate prognostic information that can be used to target implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy in patients at the highest risk of SCD.</p></sec>

Incident Cardiovascular Disease Among Adults With Blood Pressure <140/90 mm Hg
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data from before the 2000s indicate that the majority of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events occur among US adults with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) ≥140/90 mm Hg. Over the past several decades, BP has declined and hypertension control has improved.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We estimated the percentage of incident CVD events that occur at SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg in a pooled analysis of 3 contemporary US cohorts: the REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke), the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), and the JHS (Jackson Heart Study) (n=31 856; REGARDS=21 208; MESA=6779; JHS=3869). Baseline study visits were conducted in 2003 to 2007 for REGARDS, 2000 to 2002 for MESA, and 2000 to 2004 for JHS. BP was measured by trained staff using standardized methods. Antihypertensive medication use was self-reported. The primary outcome was incident CVD, defined by the first occurrence of fatal or nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, or heart failure. Events were adjudicated in each study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Over a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, 2584 participants had incident CVD events. Overall, 63.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.9−71.1) of events occurred in participants with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg; 58.4% (95% CI, 47.7−69.2) and 68.1% (95% CI, 60.1−76.0) among those taking and not taking antihypertensive medication, respectively. The majority of events occurred in participants with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg among those <65 years of age (66.7%; 95% CI, 60.5−73.0) and ≥65 years of age (60.3%; 95% CI, 51.0−69.5), women (61.4%; 95% CI, 49.9−72.9) and men (63.8%; 95% CI, 58.4−69.1), and for whites (68.7%; 95% CI, 66.1−71.3), blacks (59.0%; 95% CI, 49.5−68.6), Hispanics (52.7%; 95% CI, 45.1−60.4), and Chinese-Americans (58.5%; 95% CI, 45.2−71.8). Among participants taking antihypertensive medication with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg, 76.6% (95% CI, 75.8−77.5) were eligible for statin treatment, but only 33.2% (95% CI, 32.1−34.3) were taking one, and 19.5% (95% CI, 18.5−20.5) met the SPRINT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) eligibility criteria and may benefit from a SBP target goal of 120 mm Hg.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although higher BP levels are associated with increased CVD risk, in the modern era, the majority of incident CVD events occur in US adults with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg. While absolute risk and cost-effectiveness should be considered, additional CVD risk-reduction measures for adults with SBP/DBP <140/90 mm Hg at high risk for CVD may be warranted.</p></sec>

Effect of Intensive Blood Pressure Lowering on Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in Patients With Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is currently unknown whether intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering beyond that recommended would lead to more lowering of the risk of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with hypertension and whether reducing the risk of LVH explains the reported cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefits of intensive BP lowering in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This analysis included 8164 participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 35.3% women; 31.2% blacks) with hypertension but no diabetes mellitus from the SPRINT trial (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial): 4086 randomly assigned to intensive BP lowering (target SBP <120 mm Hg) and 4078 assigned to standard BP lowering (target SBP <140 mm Hg). Progression and regression of LVH as defined by Cornell voltage criteria derived from standard 12-lead ECGs recorded at baseline and biannually were compared between treatment arms during a median follow-up of 3.81 years. The effect of intensive (versus standard) BP lowering on the SPRINT primary CVD outcome (a composite of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart failure, and CVD death) was compared before and after adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among SPRINT participants without baseline LVH (n=7559), intensive (versus standard) BP lowering was associated with a 46% lower risk of developing LVH (hazard ratio=0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.68). Similarly, among SPRINT participants with baseline LVH (n=605, 7.4%), those assigned to the intensive (versus standard) BP lowering were 66% more likely to regress/improve their LVH (hazard ratio=1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.11). Adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate did not substantially attenuate the effect of intensive BP therapy on CVD events (hazard ratio of intensive versus standard BP lowering on CVD, 0.76 [95% confidence interval, 0.64–0.90] and 0.77 [95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.91] before and after adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with hypertension but no diabetes mellitus, intensive BP lowering (target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic BP <120 mm Hg) compared with standard BP lowering (target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic BP <140 mm Hg) resulted in lower rates of developing new LVH in those without LVH and higher rates of regression of LVH in those with existing LVH.

Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Nonshockable-Turned-Shockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) commonly presents with nonshockable rhythms (a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>e and pulseless electric activity). It is unknown whether antiarrhythmic drugs are safe and effective when nonshockable rhythms evolve to shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tachycardia</span></strong> [VF/VT]) during resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with nontraumatic OHCA, vascular access, and VF/VT anytime after ≥1 shock(s) were prospectively randomized, double-blind, to receive amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo by paramedics. Patients presenting with initial shock-refractory VF/VT were previously reported. The current study was a prespecified analysis in a separate cohort that initially presented with nonshockable OHCA and was randomized on subsequently developing shock-refractory VF/VT. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included discharge functional status and adverse drug-related effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 37 889 patients with OHCA, 3026 with initial VF/VT and 1063 with initial nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were treatment-eligible, were randomized, and received their assigned drug. Baseline characteristics among patients with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Active-drug recipients in this cohort required fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned drug, and ancillary antiarrhythmic drugs than recipients of a placebo (<i>P</i><0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital discharge (<i>P</i>=0.24). No significant interaction between treatment assignment and discharge survival occurred with the initiating OHCA rhythm (a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>e, pulseless electric activity, or VF/VT). Survival in each of these categories was consistently higher with active drugs, although the trends were not statistically significant. Adjusted absolute differences (95% confidence interval) in survival from nonshockable-turned-shockable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>s with amiodarone versus placebo were 2.3% (−0.3, 4.8), <i>P</i>=0.08, and for lidocaine versus placebo 1.2% (−1.1, 3.6), <i>P</i>=0.30. More than 50% of these survivors were functionally independent or required minimal assistance. Drug-related adverse effects were infrequent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Outcome from nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA is poor but not invariably fatal. Although not statistically significant, point estimates for survival were greater after amiodarone or lidocaine than placebo, without increased risk of adverse effects or disability and consistent with previously observed favorable trends from treatment of initial shock-refractory VF/VT with these drugs.

For example, among those with an ASCVD risk of <15% and who had an SBP of either 120 to 139 mm Hg or 140 to 159 mm Hg, respectively, we found increasing hazard ratios for events with CAC 1 to 100 (1.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.0–2.6] or 2.0 [1.1–3.8]) and CAC >100 (3.0 [1.8–5.0] or 5.7 [2.9–11.0]), all relative to CAC=0. There appeared to be no statistical association between CAC and events when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg, irrespective of ASCVD risk level. Estimated 10-year number-needed-to-treat for a SBP goal of 120mmHg varied substantially according to CAC levels when predicted ASCVD risk <15% and SBP <160mmHg (eg, 10-year number-needed-to-treat of 99 for CAC=0 and 24 for CAC>100, when SBP 120-139mm Hg). However, few participants with ASCVD risk <5% had elevated CAC. Furthermore, 10-year number-needed-to-treat estimates were consistently low and varied less among CAC strata when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg or when ASCVD risk was ≥15% at any SBP level.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Combined CAC imaging and assessment of global ASCVD risk has the potential to guide personalized SBP goals (eg, choosing a traditional goal of 140 or a more intensive goal of 120 mm Hg), particularly among adults with an estimated ASCVD risk of 5% to 15% and prehypertension or mild hypertension.</p></sec>

Incident Type 2 Myocardial Infarction in a Cohort of Patients Undergoing Coronary or Peripheral Arterial Angiography
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Despite growing recognition of type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI; related to supply/demand mismatch), little is known about its risk factors or its association with outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A single-center cohort of patients undergoing coronary or peripheral angiography with or without intervention was prospectively enrolled and followed for incident type 1 and T2MI, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, peripheral arterial complication, and cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong>), as well. T2MI was adjudicated using criteria from the Third Universal Definition of MI. Baseline characteristics, blood samples, and angiography information were obtained. Major end points subsequent to first MI were assessed using landmark analyses to compare the rates of first events only where everyone with a prior history of any MACE before MI were censored and adjusted for follow-up times. Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses with age and sex forced into all models and additional covariates evaluated by using the stepwise option for the selection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One thousand two hundred fifty-one patients were enrolled and followed for a median of 3.4 years. Of these patients, 152 (12.2%) had T2MI during follow-up; T2MI was frequently recurrent. Multivariable predictors of T2MI were older age, lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic blood pressure, history of coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, nitrate use, and elevated concentrations of glucose, N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, and cystatin C. Patients with T2MI had higher rates of subsequent adverse events than those without T2MI (per 100 person-years: MACE, 53.7 versus 21.1, <i>P</i><0.001; all-cause death, 23.3 versus 3.3, <i>P</i><0.001; cardiovascular death, 17.5 versus 2.6, <i>P</i><0.001; heart failure events, 22.4 versus 7.4, <i>P</i><0.001); these rates are similar to those seen in patients with type 1 MI. Incident diagnosis of T2MI strongly predicted risk for subsequent MACE (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.46–2.48; <i>P</i><0.001), all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.96; 95% confidence interval, 2.01–4.36; <i>P</i><0.001), and cardiovascular death (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–3.43; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>T2MI is common and associated with poor prognosis.

Prospective Study of Adenosine on Atrioventricular Nodal Conduction in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients After Heart Transplantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Supraventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tachycardia</span></strong> is common after heart transplantation. Adenosine, the standard therapy for treating supraventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tachycardia</span></strong> in children and adults without transplantation, is relatively contraindicated after transplantation because of a presumed risk of prolonged atrioventricular block in denervated hearts. This study tested whether adenosine caused prolonged a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>e after transplantation and if it was effective in blocking atrioventricular nodal conduction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a single-center prospective clinical study including healthy heart transplant recipients 6 months to 25 years of age presenting for routine cardiac catheterization during 2015 to 2016. After catheterization, a transvenous pacing catheter was placed and adenosine was given following a dose-escalation protocol until atrioventricular block was achieved. The incidence of clinically significant a<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>e (≥12 seconds after adenosine) was quantified. The effects of patient characteristics on adenosine dose required to produce atrioventricular block and duration of effect were also measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eighty patients completed adenosine testing. No patient (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0–3) required rescue ventricular pacing. Atrioventricular block was observed in 77 patients (96%; 95% confidence interval, 89–99). The median longest atrioventricular block was 1.9 seconds (interquartile range, 1.4–3.2 seconds), with a mean duration of adenosine effect of 4.3±2.0 seconds. No patient characteristic significantly predicted the adenosine dose to produce atrioventricular block or duration of effect. Results were similar across patient weight categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Adenosine induces atrioventricular block in healthy pediatric and young adult heart transplant recipients with minimal risk when low initial doses are used (25 μg/kg; 1.5 mg if ≥60 kg) and therapy is gradually escalated.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Thresholds for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Among African Americans in the Jackson Heart Study
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is the reference standard for out-of-clinic BP measurement. Thresholds for identifying ambulatory hypertension (daytime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic BP [SBP]/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic BP [DBP] ≥135/85 mm Hg, 24-hour SBP/DBP ≥130/80 mm Hg, and nighttime SBP/DBP ≥120/70 mm Hg) have been derived from European, Asian, and South American populations. We determined BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension in a US population-based sample of African American adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed data from the Jackson Heart Study, a population-based cohort study comprised exclusively of African American adults (n=5306). Analyses were restricted to 1016 participants who completed ambulatory BP monitoring at baseline in 2000 to 2004. Mean SBP and DBP levels were calculated for daytime (10:00 am–8:00 pm), 24-hour (all available readings), and nighttime (midnight–6:00 am) periods, separately. Daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension were identified using regression- and outcome-derived approaches. The composite of a cardiovascular disease or an all-cause mortality event was used in the outcome-derived approach. For this latter approach, BP thresholds were identified only for SBP because clinic DBP was not associated with the outcome. Analyses were stratified by antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among participants not taking antihypertensive medication, the regression-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP/DBP corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP of 140/90 mm Hg were 134/85 mm Hg, 130/81 mm Hg, and 123/73 mm Hg, respectively. The outcome-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP corresponding to a clinic SBP ≥140 mm Hg were 138 mm Hg, 134 mm Hg, and 129 mm Hg, respectively. Among participants taking antihypertensive medication, the regression-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP/DBP corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP of 140/90 mm Hg were 135/85 mm Hg, 133/82 mm Hg, and 128/76 mm Hg, respectively. The corresponding outcome-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP were 140 mm Hg, 137 mm Hg, and 133 mm Hg, respectively, among those taking antihypertensive medication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>On the basis of the outcome-derived approach for SBP and regression-derived approach for DBP, the following definitions for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime hypertension corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mm Hg are proposed for African American adults: daytime SBP/DBP ≥140/85 mm Hg, 24-hour SBP/DBP ≥135/80 mm Hg, and nighttime SBP/DBP ≥130/75 mm Hg, respectively.</p></sec>

Inhibiting Insulin-Mediated β<sub>2</sub>-Adrenergic Receptor Activation Prevents Diabetes-Associated Cardiac Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity independently increase the risk of heart failure by incompletely understood mechanisms. We propose that hyperinsulinemia might promote adverse consequences in the hearts of subjects with type-2 DM and obesity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>High-fat diet feeding was used to induce obesity and DM in wild-type mice or mice lacking β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) or β-arrestin2. Wild-type mice fed with high-fat diet were treated with a β-blocker carvedilol or a GRK2 (G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2) inhibitor. We examined signaling and cardiac contractile function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>High-fat diet feeding selectively increases the expression of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) in mouse hearts, in concert with reduced protein kinase A phosphorylation of phospholamban, which contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic dysfunction. The expression of PDE4D is also elevated in human hearts with DM. The induction of PDE4D expression is mediated by an insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate, and GRK2 and β-arrestin2-dependent transactivation of a β<sub>2</sub>AR-extracellular regulated protein kinase signaling cascade. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of β<sub>2</sub>AR or GRK2, or genetic deletion of β<sub>2</sub>AR or β-arrestin2, all significantly attenuate insulin-induced phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinase and PDE4D induction to prevent DM-related contractile dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These studies elucidate a novel mechanism by which hyperinsulinemia contributes to heart failure by increasing PDE4D expression and identify β<sub>2</sub>AR or GRK2 as plausible therapeutic targets for preventing or treating heart failure in subjects with type 2 DM.</p></sec>

Effect of Aggressive Blood Pressure Control on the Recurrence of Atrial Fibrillation After Catheter Ablation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation has become an important therapy for AF; however, recurrence rates remain high. We proposed to determine whether aggressive blood pressure (BP) lowering prevents recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) after catheter ablation in patients with AF and a high symptom burden.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We randomly assigned 184 patients with AF and a BP >130/80 mm Hg to aggressive BP (target <120/80 mm Hg) or standard BP (target <140/90 mm Hg) treatment before their scheduled AF catheter ablation. The primary outcome was symptomatic recurrence of AF/atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tachycardia</span></strong>/atrial flutter lasting >30 seconds, determined 3 months beyond catheter ablation by a blinded end-point evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median follow-up was 14 months. At 6 months, the mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic BP was 123.2±13.2 mm Hg in the aggressive BP treatment group versus 135.4±15.7 mm Hg (<i>P</i><0.001) in the standard treatment group. The primary outcome occurred in 106 patients, 54 (61.4%) in the aggressive BP treatment group compared with 52 (61.2%) in the standard treatment group (hazard ratio=0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.65–1.38; <i>P</i>=0.763). In the prespecified subgroup analysis of the influence of age, patients ≥61 years of age had a lower primary outcome event rate with aggressive BP (hazard ratio=0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.34–0.97; <i>P</i>=0.013). There was a higher rate of hypotension requiring medication adjustment in the aggressive BP group (26% versus 0%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this study, this duration of aggressive BP treatment did not reduce atrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">arrhythmia</span></strong> recurrence after catheter ablation for AF but resulted in more hypotension.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Potential Deaths Averted and Serious Adverse Events Incurred From Adoption of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) Intensive Blood Pressure Regimen in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>SPRINT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) demonstrated a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 versus <140 mm Hg among US adults at high cardiovascular disease risk but without diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart failure. To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive goal implementation, we estimated the deaths prevented and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked with the National Death Index through December 2011. SPRINT eligibility included age ≥50 years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg (depending on the number of antihypertensive medications being taken), and high cardiovascular disease risk. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>, or dialysis. Annual mortality rates were calculated by dividing the Kaplan-Meier 5-year mortality by 5. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and heart failure and absolute risks for serious adverse events in SPRINT were used to estimate the number of potential deaths and heart failure cases prevented and serious adverse events incurred with intensive SBP treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 68.6 years, and 83.2% and 7.4% were non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, respectively. The annual mortality rate was 2.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91–2.48), and intensive SBP treatment was projected to prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year (95% CI, 93 300–121 200) and give rise to 56 100 (95% CI, 50 800–61 400) episodes of hypotension, 34 400 (95% CI, 31 200–37 600) episodes of syncope, 43 400 (95% CI, 39 400–47 500) serious electrolyte disorders, and 88 700 (95% CI, 80 400–97 000) cases of acute kidney injury per year. The analysis-of-extremes approach indicated that the range of estimated lower- and upper-bound number of deaths prevented per year with intensive SBP control was 34 600 to 179 600. Intensive SBP control was projected to prevent 46 100 (95% CI, 41 800–50 400) cases of heart failure annually.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>If fully implemented in eligible US adults, intensive SBP treatment could prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year. A consequence of this treatment strategy, however, could be an increase in serious adverse events.</p></sec>

Detailed Echocardiographic Phenotyping in Breast Cancer Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease in patients with breast cancer is of growing concern. The longitudinal effects of commonly used therapies, including doxorubicin and trastuzumab, on cardiac remodeling and function remain unknown in this population. We aimed to define the changes in echocardiographic parameters of structure, function, and ventricular-arterial coupling, and their associations with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and heart failure symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a longitudinal prospective cohort study of 277 breast cancer participants receiving doxorubicin (Dox), trastuzumab (Tras), or both (Dox+Tras), we obtained 1249 echocardiograms over a median follow-up of 2.0 (interquartile range, 1.0–3.0) years. Left ventricular structure, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diastol</span></strong>ic and contractile function, and ventricular-arterial coupling measures were quantified in a core laboratory blinded to participant characteristics. We evaluated changes in echocardiographic parameters over time, and used repeated-measures regression models to define their association with LVEF decline and recovery. Linear regression models defined the association between early changes in these parameters and subsequent changes in LVEF and heart failure symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 177 (64%) received Dox, 51 (18%) received Tras, and 49 (18%) received Dox+Tras. With Dox, there was a sustained, modest decrease in LVEF over the follow-up duration (1-year change in LVEF –3.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], –4.4% to –2.8%; 3-year change –3.8%; 95% CI, –5.1% to –2.5%). With Tras, a similar LVEF decline was observed at 1 year (–4.5%; 95% CI, –6.0% to –2.9%) and 3 years (–2.8%; 95%CI, –5.3 to –0.4%). Participants receiving Dox+Tras demonstrated the greatest declines at 1 year (–6.6%; 95% CI, –8.2 to –5.0%), with partial recovery at 3 years (–2.8%; 95% CI, –4.8 to –0.8%). LVEF declines and recovery were associated primarily with changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">systol</span></strong>ic volumes, longitudinal and circumferential strain, and ventricular-arterial coupling indices, effective arterial elastance (Ea) and the coupling ratio Ea/Ees<sub>sb</sub>, without evidence for effect modification across therapies. Early changes in volumes, strain, and Ea/Ees<sub>sb</sub> at 4 to 6 months were associated with 1- and 2-year LVEF changes. Similarly, early changes in strain and Ea were associated with worsening heart failure symptoms at 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Doxorubicin and trastuzumab resulted in modest, persistent declines in LVEF at 3 years. Changes in volumes, strain, and ventricular-arterial coupling were consistently associated with concurrent and subsequent LVEF declines and recovery across therapies.</p></sec>

Fitness Trade-Offs Lead to Suppressor Tolerance in Yeast
<p>Genetic variation among individuals within a population provides the raw material for phenotypic diversity upon which natural selection operates. Some given variants can act on multiple standing genomic variations simultaneously and release previously inaccessible phenotypes, leading to increased adaptive potential upon challenging environments. Previously, we identified such a variant related to a tRNA nonsense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> in yeast. When introduced into other genetic backgrounds, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> led to an increased population phenotypic variance on various culture conditions, conferring background and environment specific selective advantages. Nonetheless, most isolates are intolerant to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> on rich media due to a severe fitness cost. Here, we found that the tolerance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> is related to a surprising level of fitness outburst, showing a trade-off effect to accommodate the cost of carrying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>. To dissect the genetic basis of such trade-offs, we crossed strains with contrasting tolerance levels on rich media, and analyzed the fitness distribution patterns in the offspring. Combining quantitative tetrad analysis and bulk segregant analysis, we identified two genes, namely <i>MKT1</i> and <i>RGA1</i>, involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance. We showed that alleles from the tolerant parent for both genes conferred a significant gain of fitness, which increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance. Our results present a detailed dissection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> tolerance in yeast and provide insights into the molecular basis of trade-offs between fitness and evolutionary potential.</p>

A unique type of GSK-3 inhibitor brings new opportunities to the clinic
<p>Development of protein kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s is a focus of many drug discovery programs. A major problem, however, is the limited specificity of the commonly used adenosine triphosphate–competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s and the weak inhibition of the more selective substrate-competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Glycogen synthase kinase–3 (GSK-3) is a promising drug target for treating neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but most GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have not reached the clinic. We describe a new type of GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>, L807mts, that acts through a substrate-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> conversion mechanism that occurs within the catalytic site of the enzyme. We determined that L807mts was a potent and highly selective GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> with reasonable pharmacological and safety properties when tested in rodents. Treatment with L807mts enhanced the clearance of β-amyloid loads, reduced inflammation, enhanced autophagic flux, and improved cognitive and social skills in the 5XFAD AD mouse model. This new modality of GSK-3 inhibition may be therapeutic in patients with AD or other central nervous system disorders associated with dysregulated GSK-3.</p>

Discharge on the day of surgery following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty within the United Kingdom NHS
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has been successfully   performed in the United States healthcare system on outpatients.   Despite differences in healthcare structure and financial environment,   we hypothesised that it would be feasible to replicate this success   and perform UKA with safe day of surgery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e within the NHS,   in the United Kingdom. This has not been reported in any other United   Kingdom centres.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We report our experience of implementing a pathway to allow safe   day of surgery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e following UKA.

Hospital Variation in Adherence Rates to Secondary Prevention Medications and the Implications on Quality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Medication adherence is important to improve the long-term outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (MI). We hypothesized that there is significant variation among US hospitals in terms of medication adherence after MI, and that patients treated at hospitals with higher medication adherence after MI will have better long-term cardiovascular outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified 19 704 Medicare patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed after acute MI from 347 US hospitals participating in the ACTION Registry-GWTG (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines) from January 2, 2007, to October 1, 2010. Using linked Medicare Part D prescription filling data, medication adherence was defined as proportion of days covered >80% within 90 days after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compare 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events among hospitals with high, moderate, and low 90-day medication adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By 90 days after MI, overall rates of adherence to medications prescribed at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e were 68% for β-blockers, 63% for statins, 64% for angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers, and 72% for thienopyridines. Adherence to these medications up to 90 days varied significantly among hospitals: β-blockers (proportion of days covered >80%; 59% to 75%), statins (55% to 69%), thienopyridines (64% to 77%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers (57% to 69%). Compared with hospitals in the lowest quartile of 90-day composite medication adherence, hospitals with the highest adherence had lower unadjusted and adjusted 2-year major adverse cardiovascular event risk (27.5% versus 35.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.96). High-adherence hospitals also had lower adjusted rates of death or readmission (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.96), whereas there was no difference in mortality after adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of secondary prevention medications after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e varies significantly among US hospitals and is inversely associated with 2-year outcomes. Hospitals may improve medication adherence after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e and patient outcomes through better coordination of care between inpatient and outpatient settings.</p></sec>

Medical Therapy for Secondary Prevention and Long-Term Outcome in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 5% to 10% of all patients with myocardial infarction. Clinical trials of secondary prevention treatment in MINOCA patients are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between treatment with statins, renin-angiotensin system blockers, β-blockers, dual antiplatelet therapy, and long-term cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This is an observational study of MINOCA patients recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) between July 2003 and June 2013 and followed until December 2013 for outcome events in the Swedish Cause of Death Register and National Patient Register. Of 199 162 myocardial infarction admissions, 9466 consecutive unique patients with MINOCA were identified. Among those, the 9136 patients surviving the first 30 days after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e constituted the study population. Mean age was 65.3 years, and 61% were women. No patient was lost to follow-up. A stratified propensity score analysis was performed to match treated and untreated groups. The association between treatment and outcome was estimated by comparing between treated and untreated groups by using Cox proportional hazards models. The exposures were treatment at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events defined as all-cause mortality, hospitalization for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e, 84.5%, 64.1%, 83.4%, and 66.4% of the patients were on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively. During the follow-up of a mean of 4.1 years, 2183 (23.9%) patients experienced a major adverse cardiac event. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for major adverse cardiac events were 0.77 (0.68–0.87), 0.82 (0.73–0.93), and 0.86 (0.74–1.01) in patients on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers, and β-blockers, respectively. For patients on dual antiplatelet therapy followed for 1 year, the hazard ratio was 0.90 (0.74–1.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The results indicate long-term beneficial effects of treatment with statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers on outcome in patients with MINOCA, a trend toward a positive effect of β-blocker treatment, and a neutral effect of dual antiplatelet therapy. Properly powered randomized clinical trials to confirm these results are warranted.</p></sec>

Androgen receptor inhibitor–induced “BRCAness” and PARP inhibition are synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer
<p>Cancers with loss-of-function mutations in <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> are deficient in the DNA damage repair pathway called homologous recombination (HR), rendering these cancers exquisitely vulnerable to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. This functional state and therapeutic sensitivity is referred to as “BRCAness” and is most commonly associated with some breast cancer types. Pharmaceutical induction of BRCAness could expand the use of PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s to other tumor types. For example, <i>BRCA</i> mutations are present in only ~20% of prostate cancer patients. We found that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells showed increased expression of a set of HR-associated genes, including <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>RAD54L</i>, and <i>RMI2</i>. Although androgen-targeted therapy is typically not effective in CRPC patients, the androgen receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> enzalutamide suppressed the expression of those HR genes in CRPC cells, thus creating HR deficiency and BRCAness. A “lead-in” treatment strategy, in which enzalutamide was followed by the PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> olaparib, promoted DNA damage–induced cell death and inhibited clonal proliferation of prostate cancer cells in culture and suppressed the growth of prostate cancer xenografts in mice. Thus, antiandrogen and PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> combination therapy may be effective for CRPC patients and suggests that pharmaceutically inducing BRCAness may expand the clinical use of PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s.</p>

Human-level performance in 3D multiplayer games with population-based reinforcement learning
<p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great success in increasingly complex single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong> environments and two-player turn-based games. However, the real world contains multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>s, each learning and acting independently to cooperate and compete with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>s. We used a tournament-style evaluation to demonstrate that an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong> can achieve human-level performance in a three-dimensional multiplayer first-person video game, <i>Quake III Arena</i> in Capture the Flag mode, using only pixels and game points scored as input. We used a two-tier optimization process in which a population of independent RL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>s are trained concurrently from thousands of parallel matches on randomly generated environments. Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong> learns its own internal reward signal and rich representation of the world. These results indicate the great potential of multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong> reinforcement learning for artificial intelligence research.</p>

Impact of Bystander Automated External Defibrillator Use on Survival and Functional Outcomes in Shockable Observed Public Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable rhythms can be improved with early defibrillation. Although shockable OHCA accounts for only ≈25% of overall arrests, ≈60% of public OHCAs are shockable, offering the possibility of restoring thousands of individuals to full recovery with early defibrillation by bystanders. We sought to determine the association of bystander automated external defibrillator use with survival and functional outcomes in shockable observed public OHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium prospectively collected detailed information on all cardiac arrests at 9 regional centers. The exposures were shock administration by a bystander-applied automated external defibrillator in comparison with initial defibrillation by emergency medical services. The primary outcome measure was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with normal or near-normal (favorable) functional status defined as a modified Rankin Score ≤2. Survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e was the secondary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 49 555 OHCAs, 4115 (8.3%) observed public OHCAs were analyzed, of which 2500 (60.8%) were shockable. A bystander shock was applied in 18.8% of the shockable arrests. Patients shocked by a bystander were significantly more likely to survive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e (66.5% versus 43.0%) and be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed with favorable functional outcome (57.1% versus 32.7%) than patients initially shocked by emergency medical services. After adjusting for known predictors of outcome, the odds ratio associated with a bystander shock was 2.62 (95% confidence interval, 2.07–3.31) for survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e and 2.73 (95% confidence interval, 2.17–3.44) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with favorable functional outcome. The benefit of bystander shock increased progressively as emergency medical services response time became longer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Bystander automated external defibrillator use before emergency medical services arrival in shockable observed public OHCA was associated with better survival and functional outcomes. Continued emphasis on public automated external defibrillator utilization programs may further improve outcomes of OHCA.</p></sec>

Association Between Duration of Resuscitation and Favorable Outcome After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little evidence guides the appropriate duration of resuscitation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and case features justifying longer or shorter durations are ill defined. We estimated the impact of resuscitation duration on the probability of favorable functional outcome in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using a large, multicenter cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a secondary analysis of a North American, single-blind, multicenter, cluster-randomized, clinical trial (ROC-PRIMED [Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Prehospital Resuscitation Using an Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed]) of consecutive adults with nontraumatic, emergency medical services–treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Primary exposure was duration of resuscitation in minutes (onset of professional resuscitation to return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC] or termination of resuscitation). Primary outcome was survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] score of 0–3). Subjects were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ionally classified as survival with unfavorable outcome (mRS score of 4–5), ROSC without survival (mRS score of 6), or without ROSC. Subject accrual was plotted as a function of resuscitation duration, and the dynamic probability of favorable outcome at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e was estimated for the whole cohort and subgroups.

Targeting NOTCH activation in small cell lung cancer through LSD1 inhibition
<p>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant, aggressive neuroendocrine-type cancer for which little change to first-line standard-of-care treatment has occurred within the last few decades. Unlike nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SCLC harbors few actionable mutations for therapeutic intervention. Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1 also known as KDM1A) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s were previously shown to have selective activity in SCLC models, but the underlying mechanism was elusive. Here, we found that exposure to the selective LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> ORY-1001 activated the NOTCH pathway, resulting in the suppression of the transcription factor ASCL1 and the repression of SCLC tumorigenesis. Our analyses revealed that LSD1 bound to the <i>NOTCH1</i> locus, thereby suppressing NOTCH1 expression and downstream signaling. Reactivation of NOTCH signaling with the LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> reduced the expression of ASCL1 and neuroendocrine cell lineage genes. Knockdown studies confirmed the pharmacological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>-based results. In vivo, sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition in SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models correlated with the extent of consequential NOTCH pathway activation and repression of a neuroendocrine phenotype. Complete and durable tumor regression occurred with ORY-1001–induced NOTCH activation in a chemoresistant PDX model. Our findings reveal how LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s function in this tumor and support their potential as a new and targeted therapy for SCLC.</p>

<p>The PI3K-AKT kinase signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers, particularly breast cancer, where amplification and somatic mutations of <i>PIK3CA</i> occur with high frequency in patients. Numerous small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s targeting both PI3K and AKT are under clinical evaluation, but dose-limiting toxicities and the emergence of resistance limit therapeutic efficacy. Various resistance mechanisms to PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have been identified, including de novo mutations, feedback activation of AKT, or cross-talk pathways. We found a previously unknown resistance mechanism to PI3K pathway inhibition that results in AKT rebound activation. In a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, treatment with a PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> or depletion of <i>PIK3CA</i> expression ultimately promoted AKT reactivation in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2, the kinases IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and the cell growth and metabolism-regulating complex mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2), but was independent of PI3K activity or PIP<sub>3</sub> production. Resistance to PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s correlated with the increased abundance of Skp2, ubiquitylation of AKT, cell proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. These findings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> resistance may emerge in aggressive breast cancer cells.</p>

Identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of type 1 adenylyl cyclase activity with analgesic properties
<p>Adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) belongs to a group of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) that are stimulated by calcium in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Studies with AC1 knockout mice suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of AC1 may be useful for treating pain and opioid dependence. However, nonselective inhibition of AC isoforms could result in substantial adverse effects. We used chemical library screening to identify a selective AC1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> with a chromone core structure that may represent a new analgesic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>. After demonstrating that the compound (ST034307) inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably transfected with AC1 (HEK-AC1 cells), we confirmed selectivity for AC1 by testing against all isoforms of membrane-bound ACs. ST034307 also inhibited AC1 activity stimulated by forskolin- and Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors in HEK-AC1 cells and showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>y activity in multiple AC1-containing membrane preparations and mouse hippocampal homogenates. ST034307 enhanced μ-opioid receptor (MOR)–mediated inhibition of AC1 in short-term inhibition assays in HEK-AC1 cells stably transfected with MOR; however, the compound blocked heterologous sensitization of AC1 caused by chronic MOR activation in these cells. ST034307 reduced pain responses in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. Our data indicate that ST034307 is a selective small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> of AC1 and suggest that selective AC1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s may be useful for managing pain.</p>

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s of RNA silencing induce developmental defects similar to those caused by mutations in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>-mediated developmental defects to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental defects in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> mutation. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>-mediated developmental defects, using two independent <i>arf8</i> mutations and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> of silencing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F1 generation, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the phenotype in the F2 generation. However, the loss of phenotype in the F2 generation was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent loss-of-function point mutation, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 generations. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental defects caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

ICare-ACS (Improving Care Processes for Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to safely reduce length of stay for emergency department patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have had mixed success. Few system-wide efforts affecting multiple hospital emergency departments have ever been evaluated. We evaluated the effectiveness of a nationwide implementation of clinical pathways for potential ACS in disparate hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter pragmatic stepped-wedge before-and-after trial in 7 New Zealand acute care hospitals with 31 332 patients investigated for suspected ACS with serial troponin measurements. The implementation was a clinical pathway for the assessment of patients with suspected ACS that included a clinical pathway document in paper or electronic format, structured risk stratification, specified time points for electrocardiographic and serial troponin testing within 3 hours of arrival, and directions for combining risk stratification and electrocardiographic and troponin testing in an accelerated diagnostic protocol.

The main outcome measure was the odds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e within 6 hours of presentation</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 11 529 participants in the preimplementation phase (range, 284–3465) and 19 803 in the postimplementation phase (range, 395–5039). Overall, the mean 6-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e rate increased from 8.3% (range, 2.7%–37.7%) to 18.4% (6.8%–43.8%). The odds of being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed within 6 hours increased after clinical pathway implementation. The odds ratio was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.3–2.6). In patients without ACS, the median length of hospital stays decreased by 2.9 hours (95% confidence interval, 2.4–3.4). For patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed within 6 hours, there was no change in 30-day major adverse cardiac event rates (0.52% versus 0.44%; <i>P</i>=0.96).

Cardiovascular Effects of Performance-Enhancing Drugs
<p>Exercise and competitive sports should be associated with a wide range of health benefits with the potential to inspire a positive community health legacy. However, the reputation of sports is being threatened by an ever-expanding armamentarium of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>s with real or perceived benefits in performance enhancement. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to the injustice of unfair advantage for dishonest athletes, significant potential health risks are associated with performance-enhancing drugs. Performance-enhancing drugs may have an effect on the cardiovascular system by means of directly altering the myocardium, vasculature, and metabolism. However, less frequently considered is the potential for indirect effects caused through enabling athletes to push beyond normal physiological limits with the potential consequence of exercise-induced arrhythmias. This review will summarize the known health effects of PEDs but will also focus on the potentially greater health threat posed by the covert search for performance-enhancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>s that have yet to be recognized by the World Anti-Doping Agency. History has taught us that athletes are subjected to unmonitored trials with experimental drugs that have little or no established efficacy or safety data. One approach to decrease drug abuse in sports would be to accept that there is a delay from when athletes start experimenting with novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>s to the time when authorities become aware of these drugs. This provides a window of opportunity for athletes to exploit with relative immunity. It could be argued that all off-label use of any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong> should be deemed illegal.</p>

Covalent inhibitors of EGFR family protein kinases induce degradation of human Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) pseudokinase in cancer cells
<p>A major challenge associated with biochemical and cellular analysis of pseudokinases is a lack of target-validated small-molecule compounds with which to probe function. Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with a diverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There is substantial evidence that human TRIB2 promotes survival and drug resistance in solid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutic target. The unusual TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-rich C-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminal tail, which also supports its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases. We found that TRIB2 is a target of previously described small-molecule protein kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinase domains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Using a thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB2-binding compounds within the Published Kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> Set (PKIS) and used a drug repurposing approach to classify compounds that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB2 in vitro. TRIB2 destabilizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>s, including the covalent drug afatinib, led to rapid TRIB2 degradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signaling and survival. Our data reveal new drug leads for the development of TRIB2-degrading compounds, which will also be invaluable for unraveling the cellular mechanisms of TRIB2-based signaling. Our study highlights that small molecule–induced protein down-regulation through drug “off-targets” might be relevant for other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s that serendipitously target pseudokinases.</p>

Developmental phosphoproteomics identifies the kinase CK2 as a driver of Hedgehog signaling and a therapeutic target in medulloblastoma
<p>A major limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of drug resistance, which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the drug target or through intrinsic resistance of subpopulations of tumor cells. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain tumor, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and drug-resistant. To find new drug targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to common resistance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins commonly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB tumors that were resistant to currently available Hh <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, thereby extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this drug may avoid at least one common mode of acquired resistance. These findings suggest that CK2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.</p>

Inflammatory but not mitogenic contexts prime synovial fibroblasts for compensatory signaling responses to p38 inhibition
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that causes joint pain, swelling, and loss of function. Development of effective new drugs has proven challenging in part because of the complexities and interconnected nature of intracellular signaling networks that complicate the effects of pharmacological interventions. We characterized the kinase signaling pathways that are activated in RA and evaluated the multivariate effects of targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Synovial fluids from RA patients activated the kinase signaling pathways JAK, JNK, p38, and MEK in synovial fibroblasts (SFs), a stromal cell type that promotes RA progression. Kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s enhanced signaling of “off-target” pathways in a manner dependent on stimulatory context. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of p38, which have been widely explored in clinical trials for RA, resulted in undesirable increases in nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JNK, and MEK signaling in SFs in inflammatory, but not mitogenic, contexts. This was mediated by the transcription factor CREB, which functions in part within a negative feedback loop in MAPK signaling. CREB activation was induced predominately by p38 in response to inflammatory stimuli, but by MEK in response to mitogenic stimuli; hence, the effects of drugs targeting p38 or MEK were markedly different in SFs cultured under mitogenic or inflammatory conditions. Together, these findings illustrate how stimulatory context can alter dominance in pathway cross-talk even for a fixed network topology, thereby providing a rationale for why p38 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s deliver limited benefits in RA and demonstrating the need for careful consideration of p38-targeted drugs in inflammation-related disorders.</p>

MEK inhibitor trametinib does not prevent the growth of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)–addicted neuroblastomas
<p>Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is implicated in driving the initiation and progression of multiple cancers. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s targeting the RAS-MAPK pathway are clinically approved as single- or poly<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong> therapies for patients with specific types of cancer. One example is the MEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> trametinib, which is included as a rational polytherapy strategy for treating EML4-ALK–positive, EGFR-activated, or KRAS-mutant lung cancers and neuroblastomas that also contain activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, in neuroblastoma, a heterogeneous disease, relapse cases display an increased rate of mutations in <i>ALK</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, and <i>NF1</i>, leading to increased activation of RAS-MAPK signaling. Co-targeting ALK and the RAS-MAPK pathway is an attractive option, because monotherapies have not yet produced effective results in ALK-addicted neuroblastoma patients. We evaluated the response of neuroblastoma cell lines to MEK-ERK pathway inhibition by trametinib. In contrast to RAS-MAPK pathway-mutated neuroblastoma cell lines, ALK-addicted neuroblastoma cells treated with trametinib showed increased activation (inferred by phosphorylation) of the kinases AKT and ERK5. This feedback response was mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2–associated protein SIN1, resulting in increased survival and proliferation that depended on AKT signaling. In xenografts in mice, trametinib inhibited the growth of EML4-ALK–positive non–small cell lung cancer and RAS-mutant neuroblastoma but not ALK-addicted neuroblastoma. Thus, our results advise against the seemingly rational option of using MEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s to treat ALK-addicted neuroblastoma.</p>

Differential abundance of CK1α provides selectivity for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-dependent tumors
<p>Constitutive WNT activity drives the growth of various human tumors, including nearly all colorectal cancers (CRCs). Despite this prominence in cancer, no WNT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> is currently approved for use in the clinic largely due to the small number of druggable signaling components in the WNT pathway and the substantial toxicity to normal gastrointestinal tissue. We have shown that pyrvinium, which activates casein kinase 1α (CK1α), is a potent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> of WNT signaling. However, its poor bioavailability limited the ability to test this first-in-class WNT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> in vivo. We characterized a novel small-molecule CK1α activator called SSTC3, which has better pharmacokinetic properties than pyrvinium, and found that it inhibited the growth of CRC xenografts in mice. SSTC3 also attenuated the growth of a patient-derived metastatic CRC xenograft, for which few therapies exist. SSTC3 exhibited minimal gastrointestinal toxicity compared to other classes of WNT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Consistent with this observation, we showed that the abundance of the SSTC3 target, CK1α, was decreased in WNT-driven tumors relative to normal gastrointestinal tissue, and knocking down CK1α increased cellular sensitivity to SSTC3. Thus, we propose that distinct CK1α abundance provides an enhanced therapeutic index for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-driven tumors.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Inhibits Auxin-Induced Lateral Rooting Independently of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 Receptor
<p>Plant root systems are indispensable for water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and anchoring plants in the soil. Previous studies using auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s definitively established that auxin plays a central role regulating root growth and development. Most auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s affect all auxin signaling at the same time, which obscures an understanding of individual events. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a lateral root (LR)-preferential auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in a manner that is independent of the JA receptor, CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1). Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with either (−)-JA or (+)-JA reduced primary root length and LR number; the reduction of LR number was also observed in <i>coi1</i> mutants. Treatment of seedlings with (−)-JA or (+)-JA suppressed auxin-inducible genes related to LR formation, diminished accumulation of the auxin reporter <i>DR5::GUS</i>, and inhibited auxin-dependent DII-VENUS degradation. A structural mimic of (−)-JA and (+)-coronafacic acid also inhibited LR formation and stabilized DII-VENUS protein. COI1-independent activity was retained in the double mutant of <i>transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> response1</i> and <i>auxin signaling f-box protein2</i> (<i>tir1 afb2</i>) but reduced in the <i>afb5</i> single mutant. These results reveal JAs and (+)-coronafacic acid to be selective counter-auxins, a finding that could lead to new approaches for studying the mechanisms of LR formation.</p>

Functional Analysis of Short Linear Motifs in the Plant Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor SIAMESE
<p>Endoreplication, a modified cell cycle in which DNA is replicated without subsequent cell division, plays an important but poorly understood role in plant growth and in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SIAMESE</i> (<i>SIM</i>) gene encodes the first identified member of the SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) family of cyclin-dependent kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. <i>SIM</i> controls endoreplication during trichome development, and <i>sim</i> mutant trichomes divide several times instead of endoreplicating their DNA. The SMR family is defined by several short linear amino acid sequence motifs of largely unknown function, and family members have little sequence similarity to any known protein functional domains. Here, we investigated the roles of the conserved motifs in <i>SIM</i> site-directed Arabidopsis mutants using several functional assays. We identified a potential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-binding site, which bears no resemblance to other known CDK interaction motifs. We also identified a potential site of phosphorylation and two redundant nuclear localization sequences. Surprisingly, the only motif with similarity to the other family of plant CDK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>/INTERACTOR OF CDC2 KINASE/KIP-RELATED PROTEIN proteins, is not required for <i>SIM</i> function in vivo. Because even highly divergent members of the <i>SMR</i> family are able to replace <i>SIM</i> function in Arabidopsis trichomes, it is likely that the results obtained here for <i>SIM</i> will apply to other members of this plant-specific family of CDK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of JA biosynthesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Mode of action of a <i>Drosophila</i> FMRFamide in inducing muscle contraction
<p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a model system for examining the mechanisms of action of neuropeptides. DPKQDFMRFamide was previously shown to induce contractions in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscle fibres in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The present study examined the possible involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor and second messengers in mediating this myotropic effect after removal of the central nervous system. DPKQDFMRFamide-induced contractions were reduced by 70% and 90%, respectively, in larvae with reduced expression of the <i>Drosophila Fmrf</i> receptor (FR) either ubiquitously or specifically in muscle tissue, compared with the response in control larvae in which expression was not manipulated. No such effect occurred in larvae with reduced expression of this gene only in neurons. The myogenic effects of DPKQDFMRFamide do not appear to be mediated through either of the two <i>Drosophila</i> myosuppressin receptors (<i>DmsR-1</i> and <i>DmsR-2</i>). DPKQDFMRFamide-induced contractions were not reduced in Ala1 transgenic flies lacking activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamKII), and were not affected by the CaMKII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> KN-93. Peptide-induced contractions in the mutants of the phospholipase C-β (<i>PLC</i>β) gene (<i>norpA</i> larvae) and in IP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants were similar to contractions elicited in control larvae. The peptide failed to increase cAMP and cGMP levels in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscles. Peptide-induced contractions were not potentiated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>, and were not antagonized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of cAMP-dependent or cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Additionally, exogenous application of arachidonic acid failed to induce myogenic contractions. Thus, DPKQDFMRFamide induces contractions via a G-protein coupled FMRFamide receptor in muscle cells but does not appear to act via cAMP, cGMP, IP<sub>3</sub>, PLC, CaMKII or arachidonic acid.</p>

Empagliflozin and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Established Cardiovascular Disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Urinary glucose excretion with empagliflozin decreases with declining renal function, resulting in less potency for glucose lowering in patients with kidney disease. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to standard of care. We analyzed cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in patients with prevalent kidney disease (defined as eGFR <60 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> and/or urine albumin-creatinine ratio >300 mg/g) at baseline. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional analyses were performed in subgroups by baseline eGFR (<45, 45–<60, 60–<90, ≥90 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>) and baseline urine albumin-creatinine ratio (>300, 30–≤300, <30 mg/g).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 7020 patients treated, 2250 patients had prevalent kidney disease at baseline, of whom 67% had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for >10 years, 58% were receiving insulin, and 84% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s or angiotensin receptor blockers. In patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 29% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–0.98), the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99), the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 39% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.87), and the risk of all-cause hospitalization by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.92).

Integrated Noninvasive Physiological Assessment of Coronary Circulatory Function and Impact on Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is suggested that the integration of maximal myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), termed coronary flow capacity, allows for comprehensive evaluation of patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease. Because management decisions are predicated on clinical risk, we sought to determine the independent and integrated value of maximal MBF and CFR for predicting cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>MBF and CFR were quantified in 4029 consecutive patients (median age 66 years, 50.5% women) referred for rest/stress myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography scans from January 2006 to December 2013. The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality. Maximal MBF <1.8 mL·g<sup>−1</sup>·min<sup>−1</sup> and CFR<2 were considered impaired. Four patient groups were identified based on the concordant or discordant impairment of maximal MBF or CFR. Association of maximal MBF and CFR with cardiovascular death was assessed using Cox and Poisson regression analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 392 (9.7%) cardiovascular deaths occurred over a median follow-up of 5.6 years.

In univariable analyses, patients with concordant impairment of CFR and maximal MBF had high cardiovascular mortality of 3.3% (95% CI, 2.9–3.7) per year. Patients with impaired CFR but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed maximal MBF had an intermediate cardiovascular mortality of 1.7% (95% CI, 1.3–2.1) per year.

A Critical Appraisal of Aspirin in Secondary Prevention
<p>Aspirin represents the <i>sine qua non</i> for antiplatelet pharmacotherapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases because of its well-established role in secondary prevention and its widespread availability and affordability. Historical studies, conducted in an era that bears little resemblance to contemporary clinical practice, demonstrated large reductions in thrombotic risk when aspirin was compared with placebo, thus forming the evidence base promulgated in practice guidelines and recommendations. P2Y<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have mostly been studied in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to aspirin; dual-antiplatelet therapy proved superiority compared with aspirin monotherapy for the prevention of ischemic events, despite increased bleeding risks. An alternative approach currently under investigation includes evaluation of single-antiplatelet therapy with P2Y<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s alone versus dual-antiplatelet therapy after acute coronary syndromes or coronary stent implantation. As the availability of more effective antiplatelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agent</span></strong>s increases, it is time to revisit the existing and long-standing paradigm supporting aspirin use for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events. Ongoing trials will provide new evidence whether the less-is-more strategy is justified.</p>

A SAP domain-containing protein shuttles between the nucleus and cell membranes and plays a role in adhesion and migration in <i>D. discoideum</i>
<p>The AmpA protein reduces cell adhesion, thereby influencing cell migration in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. To understand how <i>ampA</i> influences cell migration, second site <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s of an AmpA overexpressing cell line were created by REMI mutagenesis. Mutant candidates were identified by their ability to suppress the large plaques that the AmpA overexpressing cells form on bacterial lawns as a result of their increased rate of migration. One <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> gene, <i>sma</i>, encodes an uncharacterized protein, which contains a SAP DNA-binding domain and a PTEN-like domain. Using <i>sma</i> gene knockouts and Sma-mRFP expressing cell lines, a role for <i>sma</i> in influencing cell migration was uncovered. Knockouts of the <i>sma</i> gene in a wild-type background enhanced chemotaxis. An <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional role for Sma in influencing cell–cell adhesion was also demonstrated. Sma protein transitions between cytosolic and nuclear localizations as a function of cell density. In growing cells migrating to folic acid it is localized to regions of actin polymerization and absent from the nucleus. A role for Sma in influencing <i>ampA</i> mRNA levels is also demonstrated. Sma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ionally appears to be involved in <i>ampA</i> pathways regulating cell size, actin polymerization, and cell substrate adhesion. We present insights to the SAP domain-containing group of proteins in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and provide evidence of a role for a SAP domain-containing protein shuttling from the nucleus to sites of actin polymerization during chemotaxis to folic acid and influencing the efficiency of migration.</p>

Elongator Is Required for Root Stem Cell Maintenance by Regulating <i>SHORTROOT</i> Transcription
<p><i>SHORTROOT</i> (<i>SHR</i>) is essential for stem cell maintenance and radial patterning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots, but how its expression is regulated is unknown. Here, we report that the Elongator complex, which consists of six subunits (ELP1 to ELP6), regulates the transcription of <i>SHR</i>. Depletion of Elongator drastically reduced <i>SHR</i> expression and led to defective root stem cell maintenance and radial patterning. The importance of the nuclear localization of Elongator for its functioning, together with the insensitivity of the <i>elp1</i> mutant to the transcription elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> 6-azauracil, and the direct interaction of the ELP4 subunit with the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, support the notion that Elongator plays important roles in transcription elongation. Indeed, we found that ELP3 associates with the premessenger RNA of <i>SHR</i> and that mutation of Elongator reduces the enrichment of RNA polymerase II on the <i>SHR</i> gene body. Moreover, Elongator interacted in vivo with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4, a well-established transcription elongation factor that is recruited to the <i>SHR</i> locus. Together, these results demonstrate that Elongator acts in concert with SUPPRESSOR OF Ty4 to regulate the transcription of <i>SHR</i>.</p>

Initial Bud Outgrowth Occurs Independent of Auxin Flow from Out of Buds
<p>Apical dominance is the process whereby the shoot tip inhibits the growth of axillary buds along the stem. It has been proposed that the shoot tip, which is the predominant source of the plant hormone auxin, prevents bud outgrowth by suppressing auxin canalization and export from axillary buds into the main stem. In this theory, auxin flow out of axillary buds is a prerequisite for bud outgrowth, and buds are triggered to grow by an enhanced proportional flow of auxin from the buds. A major challenge of directly testing this model is in being able to create a bud- or stem-specific change in auxin transport. Here we evaluate the relationship between specific changes in auxin efflux from axillary buds and bud outgrowth after shoot tip removal (decapitation) in the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>). The auxin transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> 1-<i>N</i>-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and to a lesser extent, the auxin perception <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> <i>p</i>-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB), effectively blocked auxin efflux from axillary buds of intact and decapitated plants without affecting auxin flow in the main stem. Gene expression analyses indicate that NPA and PCIB regulate auxin-inducible, and biosynthesis and transport genes, in axillary buds within 3 h after application. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s had no effect on initial bud outgrowth after decapitation or cytokinin (benzyladenine; BA) treatment. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>y effects of PCIB and NPA on axillary bud outgrowth only became apparent from 48 h after treatment. These findings demonstrate that the initiation of decapitation- and cytokinin-induced axillary bud outgrowth is independent of auxin canalization and export from the bud.</p>

The Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein SOT5/EMB2279 Is Required for Plastid <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> Intron Splicing
<p>Chloroplast biogenesis and development are highly complex processes requiring interaction between plastid and nuclear genomic products. Using a high-throughput screen for chloroplast biogenesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we identified a <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong> of thf1</i> (<i>sot5</i>) that displays virescent and serrated leaves. Further characterization revealed that <i>sot5</i> mutants are defective in leaf adaxial and abaxial polarity and act as enhancers of <i>asymmetric leaves2</i>. Map-based cloning identified <i>SOT5</i> as a gene previously named <i>EMB2279</i> that encodes a plastid-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein with 11 PPR motifs. A G-to-A mutation in <i>sot5</i> leads to a significant decrease in splicing efficiency, generating two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional mRNA variants. As reported previously, the <i>sot5</i> null mutation is embryo lethal. SOT5 is predicted to bind to specific RNA sequences found in plastid <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes, and we found decreased splicing efficiency of the <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i> genes in <i>sot5</i> mutants. Together, our results reveal that the PPR protein SOT5/EMB2279 is required for intron splicing of plastid <i>rpl2</i> and <i>trnK</i>, providing insights into the role of plastid translation in the coupled development between chloroplasts and leaves.</p>

TsNAC1 Is a Key Transcription Factor in Abiotic Stress Resistance and Growth
<p>NAC proteins constitute one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors, and a number of these proteins participate in the regulation of plant development and responses to abiotic stress. <i>T. HALOPHILA STRESS RELATED NAC1</i> (<i>TsNAC1</i>), cloned from the halophyte <i>Thellungiella halophila</i>, is a <i>NAC</i> transcription factor gene, and its overexpression can improve abiotic stress resistance, especially in salt stress tolerance, in both <i>T. halophila</i> and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong> the growth of these plants. In this study, the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 and RD26 from Arabidopsis was compared with the target genes’ promoter regions of TsNAC1 from <i>T. halophila</i>, and the results showed that the transcriptional activation activity of TsNAC1 was higher in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) and yeast. The target sequence of the promoter from the target genes also was identified, and TsNAC1 was shown to target the positive regulators of ion transportation, such as <i>T. HALOPHILA H<sup>+</sup>-PPASE1</i>, and the transcription factors <i>MYB HYPOCOTYL ELONGATION-RELATED</i> and <i>HOMEOBOX12</i>. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, TsNAC1 negatively regulates the expansion of cells, inhibits <i>LIGHT-DEPENDENT SHORT HYPOCOTYLS1</i> and <i>UDP-XYLOSYLTRANSFERASE2</i>, and directly controls the expression of <i>MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA14</i>. Based on these results, we propose that TsNAC1 functions as an important upstream regulator of plant abiotic stress responses and vegetative growth.</p>

A Violaxanthin Deepoxidase Interacts with a Viral Suppressor of RNA Silencing to Inhibit Virus Amplification
<p>RNA silencing plays a critical role against viral infection. To counteract this antiviral silencing, viruses have evolved various RNA silencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>s. Meanwhile, plants have evolved counter-counter defense strategies against RNA silencing suppression (RSS). In this study, the violaxanthin deepoxidase protein of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), ZmVDE, was shown to interact specifically with the helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro; a viral RNA silencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suppressor</span></strong>) of <i>Sugarcane mosaic virus</i> (SCMV) via its mature protein region by yeast two-hybrid assay, which was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> cells. It was demonstrated that amino acids 101 to 460 in HC-Pro and the amino acid glutamine-292 in ZmVDE mature protein were essential for this interaction. The mRNA levels of <i>ZmVDE</i> were down-regulated 75% to 65% at an early stage of SCMV infection. Interestingly, ZmVDE, which normally localized in the chloroplasts and cytoplasm, could relocalize to HC-Pro-containing aggregate bodies in the presence of HC-Pro alone or SCMV infection. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, ZmVDE could attenuate the RSS activity of HC-Pro in a specific protein interaction-dependent manner. Subsequently, transient silencing of the <i>ZmVDE</i> gene facilitated SCMV RNA and coat protein accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that ZmVDE interacts with SCMV HC-Pro and attenuates its RSS activity, contributing to decreased SCMV accumulation. This study demonstrates that a host factor can be involved in secondary defense responses against viral infection in monocot plants.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG accumulation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of chloroplast metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning chloroplast function is to establish the relationship between these two redox systems and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has antioxidant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ed phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant chloroplast ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in chloroplast redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons chloroplasts, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

Metabolic Control of Tobacco Pollination by Sugars and Invertases
<p>Pollination in flowering plants is initiated by germination of pollen grains on stigmas followed by fast growth of pollen tubes representing highly energy-consuming processes. The symplastic isolation of pollen grains and tubes requires import of Suc available in the apoplast. We show that the functional coupling of Suc cleavage by invertases and uptake of the released hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollination in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolocalization of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo support the functional coupling in supplying carbohydrates for pollen germination and tube growth evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated expression. Detection of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk between male and female tissues and supported the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollination. Tissue-specific expression of an invertase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of the chemical invertase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired pollen germination. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously available Suc into the germinating pollen operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after cleavage by extracellular invertase. Reduction of extracellular invertase activity in pollen decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises pollen germination. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for pollen germination, whereas Suc is supporting tube growth, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulation of pollination by carbohydrates.</p>

Combined Experimental and Computational Approaches Reveal Distinct pH Dependence of Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors
<p>The fine-tuning of the degree of methylesterification of cell wall pectin is a key to regulating cell elongation and ultimately the shape of the plant body. Pectin methylesterification is spatiotemporally controlled by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; 66 members in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]). The comparably large number of proteinaceous pectin methylesterase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s (PMEIs; 76 members in Arabidopsis) questions the specificity of the PME-PMEI interaction and the functional role of such abundance. To understand the difference, or redundancy, between PMEIs, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the behavior of two PMEIs that are coexpressed and have distinct effects on plant development: AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9. Simulations revealed the structural determinants of the pH dependence for the interaction of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s with AtPME3, a major PME expressed in roots. Key residues that are likely to play a role in the pH dependence were identified. The predictions obtained from MD simulations were confirmed in vitro, showing that AtPMEI9 is a stronger, less pH-independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> compared with AtPMEI4. Using pollen tubes as a developmental model, we showed that these biochemical differences have a biological significance. Application of purified proteins at pH ranges in which PMEI inhibition differed between AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9 had distinct consequences on pollen tube elongation. Therefore, MD simulations have proven to be a powerful tool to predict functional diversity between PMEIs, allowing the discovery of a strategy that may be used by PMEIs to inhibit PMEs in different microenvironmental conditions and paving the way to identify the specific role of PMEI diversity in muro.</p>

Intracellular pH and its response to CO<sub>2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in symbiotic <i>versus</i> non-symbiotic coral cells
<p>Regulating intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) is critical for optimising the metabolic activity of corals, yet the mechanisms involved in pH regulation and the buffering capacity within coral cells are not well understood. Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates affects the response of pH<sub>i</sub> to <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in cells isolated from <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i>. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we simultaneously characterised the pH<sub>i</sub> response in host coral cells and their dinoflagellate symbionts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states under saturating light, with and without the photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (pH 7.8) and CO<sub>2</sub>-acidified seawater conditions (decreasing pH from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, by which time the external pH (pH<sub>e</sub>) had declined to 6.8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their pH<sub>i</sub> by 0.5 pH units above control levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion (0.2 pH unit drop in pH<sub>e</sub>) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0.3–0.4 pH units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the pH<sub>i</sub> of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the pH<sub>i</sub> recovered to control levels when photsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that photosynthetic activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from cellular acidosis after exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>/low pH.</p>

Each patient   was assigned an individualised baseline VTE risk score based on   a system using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Symptomatic VTE,   including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT),   were identified in the first 90 days post-operatively.

Similarly, the adjusted incidence of VTE following   SBTKA was 1.6% (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) with aspirin and 2.5% (95% CI   1.9 to 3.3) with warfarin. The risk of PE and VTE were reduced by   66% (odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78) and 38% (OR 0.62,   95% CI 0.38 to 1.0), respectively, using aspirin.

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A new and clinically relevant murine model of solid-organ transplant aspergillosis
<p>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of death in organ transplant patients. The murine hydrocortisone-mediated immunosuppression model of pulmonary aspergillosis is commonly used to characterise IFIs in these patients. However, this model does not take into account the effects of calcineurin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s on transplant immunity to IFIs or the fungal calcineurin pathway, which is required for both virulence and antifungal drug resistance. To address these two issues, a new and clinically relevant transplant immunosuppression model of tacrolimus (FK506) and hydrocortisone-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was developed. We first characterised IFIs in 406 patients with a lung transplant. This showed that all of the patients with pulmonary aspergillosis were immunosuppressed with calcineurin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s and steroids. Murine pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that an ideal dose of 1 mg/kg/day of FK506 intraperitoneally produced blood trough levels in the human therapeutic range (5–12 ng/ml). There was increased mortality from pulmonary aspergillosis in a transplant-relevant immunosuppression model using both FK506 and hydrocortisone as compared with immunosuppression using hydrocortisone only. Lung histopathology showed neutrophil invasion and tracheobronchitis that was associated with reduced lung tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα), JE (homologue of human MCP-1) and KC (homologue of human IL-8) at 24 hours, but increased lung TNFα, JE and KC at 48 hours when fungal burden was high. Furthermore, FK506 directly impaired fungal killing in alveolar macrophages <i>in vitro</i>, with FK506-mediated inhibition of the radial growth of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro</i> occurring at the low concentration of 5 ng/ml. Taken together, these findings show that the immunosuppressive activity of FK506 outweighs its antifungal activity <i>in vivo</i>. These observations demonstrate that FK506 impairs innate immune responses and leads to an incremental increase in susceptibility to IFIs when it is combined with steroids. This new and clinically relevant mouse model of invasive aspergillosis is a valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to the further study of both fungal immunity and antifungal therapy in organ transplantation.</p>

Association Between Early Hyperoxia Exposure After Resuscitation From Cardiac Arrest and Neurological Disability
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies examining the association between hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest and clinical outcomes have reported conflicting results. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that early postresuscitation hyperoxia is associated with poor neurological outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter prospective cohort study. We included adult patients with cardiac arrest who were mechanically ventilated and received targeted temperature management after return of spontaneous circulation. We excluded patients with cardiac arrest caused by trauma or sepsis. Per protocol, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>) was measured at 1 and 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Hyperoxia was defined as a Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> >300 mm Hg during the initial 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. The primary outcome was poor neurological function at hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score >3. Multivariable generalized linear regression with a log link was used to test the association between Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> and poor neurological outcome. To assess whether there was an association between other supranormal Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> levels and poor neurological outcome, we used other Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> cut points to define hyperoxia (ie, 100, 150, 200, 250, 350, 400 mm Hg).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 280 patients included, 105 (38%) had exposure to hyperoxia.

Hyperoxia was independently associated with poor neurological function (relative risk, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.35). On multivariable analysis, a 1-hour-longer duration of hyperoxia exposure was associated with a 3% increase in risk of poor neurological outcome (relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.05). We found that the association with poor neurological outcome began at ≥300 mm Hg.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Early hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest was independently associated with poor neurological function at hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e.</p></sec>

Inhibition of JAK-STAT Signaling Suppresses Pathogenic Immune Responses in Medium and Large Vessel Vasculitis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Giant cell arteritis, a chronic autoimmune disease of the aorta and its large branches, is complicated by aneurysm formation, dissection, and arterial occlusions. Arterial wall dendritic cells attract CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages to form prototypic granulomatous infiltrates. Vasculitic lesions contain a diverse array of effector T cells that persist despite corticosteroid therapy and sustain chronic, smoldering vasculitis. Transmural inflammation induces microvascular neoangiogenesis and results in lumen-occlusive intimal hyperplasia. We have examined whether persistent vessel wall inflammation is maintained by lesional T cells, including the newly identified tissue-resident memory T cells, and whether such T cells are sensitive to the cytokine-signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> targeting JAK3 and JAK1.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Vascular inflammation was induced in human arteries engrafted into immunodeficient mice that were reconstituted with T cells and monocytes from patients with giant cell arteritis. Mice carrying inflamed human arteries were treated with tofacitinib or vehicle. Vasculitic arteries were examined for gene expression (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), protein expression (immunohistochemistry), and infiltrating cell populations (flow cytometry).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Tofacitinib effectively suppressed innate and adaptive immunity in the vessel wall. Lesional T cells responded to tofacitinib with reduced proliferation rates (<10%) and minimal production of the effector molecules interferon-γ, interleukin-17, and interleukin-21. Tofacitinib disrupted adventitial microvascular angiogenesis, reduced outgrowth of hyperplastic intima, and minimized CD4<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident memory T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cytokine signaling dependent on JAK3 and JAK1 is critically important in chronic inflammation of medium and large arteries. The JAK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> tofacitinib effectively suppresses tissue-resident memory T cells and inhibits core vasculitogenic effector pathways.</p></sec>

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial

The development of heart failure with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">preserv</span></strong>ed ejection fraction is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention control (control; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by curve fit of the diastolic pressure-volume curve.

Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; control: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in controls (group×time <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83).

Vernier spectrometer using counterpropagating soliton microcombs
<p>Determination of laser frequency with high resolution under continuous and abrupt tuning conditions is important for sensing, spectroscopy, and communications. We show that a single microresonator provides rapid and broadband measurement of optical frequencies with a relative frequency precision comparable to that of conventional dual-frequency comb systems. Dual-locked counterpropagating solitons having slightly different repetition rates were used to implement a vernier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>er, which enabled characterization of laser tuning rates as high as 10 terahertz per second, broadly step-tuned lasers, multiline laser spectra, and molecular absorption lines. Besides providing a considerable technical simplification through the dual-locked solitons and enhanced capability for measurement of arbitrarily tuned sources, our results reveal possibilities for chip-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>ers that exceed the performance of tabletop grating and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferomet</span></strong>er-based devices.</p>

Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a), the optical counterpart to a gravitational wave source
<p>On 17 August 2017, the Laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferomet</span></strong>er Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferomet</span></strong>er detected gravitational waves (GWs) emanating from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817. Nearly simultaneously, the Fermi and INTEGRAL (INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory) telescopes detected a gamma-ray transient, GRB 170817A. At 10.9 hours after the GW trigger, we discovered a transient and fading optical source, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a), coincident with GW170817. SSS17a is located in NGC 4993, an S0 galaxy at a distance of 40 megaparsecs. The precise location of GW170817 provides an opportunity to probe the nature of these cataclysmic events by combining electromagnetic and GW observations.</p>

Measurement of the fine-structure constant as a test of the Standard Model
<p>Measurements of the fine-structure constant α require methods from across subfields and are thus powerful tests of the consistency of theory and experiment in physics. Using the recoil frequency of cesium-133 atoms in a matter-wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferomet</span></strong>er, we recorded the most accurate measurement of the fine-structure constant to date: α = 1/137.035999046(27) at 2.0 × 10<sup>−10</sup> accuracy. Using multiphoton interactions (Bragg diffraction and Bloch oscillations), we demonstrate the largest phase (12 million radians) of any Ramsey-Bordé <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interferomet</span></strong>er and control systematic effects at a level of 0.12 part per billion. Comparison with Penning trap measurements of the electron gyromagnetic anomaly <i>g<sub>e</sub></i> − 2 via the Standard Model of particle physics is now limited by the uncertainty in <i>g<sub>e</sub></i> − 2; a 2.5σ tension rejects dark photons as the reason for the unexplained part of the muon’s magnetic moment at a 99% confidence level. Implications for dark-sector candidates and electron substructure may be a sign of physics beyond the Standard Model that warrants further investigation.</p>

Electromagnetic evidence that SSS17a is the result of a binary neutron star merger
<p>Eleven hours after the detection of gravitational wave source GW170817 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Virgo Interferometers, an associated optical transient, SSS17a, was identified in the galaxy NGC 4993. Although the gravitational wave data indicate that GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints on the nature of that system. We synthesize the optical to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process). We conclude that SSS17a was the result of a binary neutron star merger, reinforcing the gravitational wave result.</p>

Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ measurement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to measure air samples from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with samples from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of measuring ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sensors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> measurement proved to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar measurements with a mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>er (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field samples (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable sensors measurement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the sensors’ methods enable accurate ARQ measurements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

Close-range remote sensing of Saturn’s rings during Cassini’s ring-grazing orbits and Grand Finale
<p>Saturn’s rings are an accessible exemplar of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">astrophys</span></strong>ical disk, tracing the Saturn system’s dynamical processes and history. We present close-range remote-sensing observations of the main rings from the Cassini spacecraft. We find detailed sculpting of the rings by embedded masses, and banded texture belts throughout the rings. Saturn-orbiting streams of material impact the F ring. There are fine-scaled correlations among optical depth, spectral properties, and temperature in the B ring, but anticorrelations within strong density waves in the A ring. There is no spectral distinction between plateaux and the rest of the C ring, whereas the region outward of the Keeler gap is spectrally distinct from nearby regions. These results likely indicate that radial stratification of particle physical properties, rather than compositional differences, is responsible for producing these ring structures.</p>

The surface composition of asteroid 162173 Ryugu from Hayabusa2 near-infrared spectroscopy
<p>The near-Earth asteroid 162173 Ryugu, the target of the Hayabusa2 sample-return mission, is thought to be a primitive carbonaceous object. We report reflectance spectra of Ryugu’s surface acquired with the Near-Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS3) on Hayabusa2, to provide direct measurements of the surface composition and geological context for the returned samples. A weak, narrow absorption feature centered at 2.72 micrometers was detected across the entire observed surface, indicating that hydroxyl (OH)–bearing minerals are ubiquitous there. The intensity of the OH feature and low albedo are similar to thermally and/or shock-metamorphosed carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. There are few variations in the OH-band position, which is consistent with Ryugu being a compositionally homogeneous rubble-pile object generated from impact fragments of an undifferentiated aqueously altered parent body.</p>

Electron-scale dynamics of the diffusion region during symmetric magnetic reconnection in space
<p>Magnetic reconnection is an energy conversion process that occurs in many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">astrophys</span></strong>ical contexts including Earth’s magnetosphere, where the process can be investigated in situ by spacecraft. On 11 July 2017, the four Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft encountered a reconnection site in Earth’s magnetotail, where reconnection involves symmetric inflow conditions. The electron-scale plasma measurements revealed (i) super-Alfvénic electron jets reaching 15,000 kilometers per second; (ii) electron meandering motion and acceleration by the electric field, producing multiple crescent-shaped structures in the velocity distributions; and (iii) the spatial dimensions of the electron diffusion region with an aspect ratio of 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with fast reconnection. The well-structured multiple layers of electron populations indicate that the dominant electron dynamics are mostly laminar, despite the presence of turbulence near the reconnection site.</p>

Neutral mass spectrometry of virus capsids above 100 megadaltons with nanomechanical resonators
<p>Measurement of the mass of particles in the mega- to gigadalton range is challenging with conventional mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>ry. Although this mass range appears optimal for nanomechanical resonators, nanomechanical mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>ers often suffer from prohibitive sample loss, extended analysis time, or inadequate resolution. We report on a system architecture combining nebulization of the analytes from solution, their efficient transfer and focusing without relying on electromagnetic fields, and the mass measurements of individual particles using nanomechanical resonator arrays. This system determined the mass distribution of ~30-megadalton polystyrene nanoparticles with high detection efficiency and effectively performed molecular mass measurements of empty or DNA-filled bacteriophage T5 capsids with masses up to 105 megadaltons using less than 1 picomole of sample and with an instrument resolution above 100.</p>

Chemical interactions between Saturn’s atmosphere and its rings
<p>The Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft made close-up measurements of Saturn’s ionosphere and upper atmosphere in the 1970s and 1980s that suggested a chemical interaction between the rings and atmosphere. Exploring this interaction provides information on ring composition and the influence on Saturn’s atmosphere from infalling material. The Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer sampled in situ the region between the D ring and Saturn during the spacecraft’s Grand Finale phase. We used these measurements to characterize the atmospheric structure and material influx from the rings. The atmospheric He/H<sub>2</sub> ratio is 10 to 16%. Volatile compounds from the rings (methane; carbon monoxide and/or molecular nitrogen), as well as larger organic-bearing grains, are flowing inward at a rate of 4800 to 45,000 kilograms per second.</p>

Multimessenger observations of a flaring blazar coincident with high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A
<p>Previous detections of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">astrophys</span></strong>ical sources of neutrinos are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy neutrino, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera–electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray–emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.</p>

Neutrino emission from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056 prior to the IceCube-170922A alert
<p>A high-energy neutrino event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino observations to search for excess emission at the position of the blazar. We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5σ evidence for neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode. This suggests that blazars are identifiable sources of the high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">astrophys</span></strong>ical neutrino flux.</p>

Background levels of methane in Mars’ atmosphere show strong seasonal variations
<p>Variable levels of methane in the martian atmosphere have eluded explanation partly because the measurements are not repeatable in time or location. We report in situ measurements at Gale crater made over a 5-year period by the Tunable Laser Spectrometer on the Curiosity rover. The background levels of methane have a mean value 0.41 ± 0.16 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) (95% confidence interval) and exhibit a strong, repeatable seasonal variation (0.24 to 0.65 ppbv). This variation is greater than that predicted from either ultraviolet degradation of impact-delivered organics on the surface or from the annual surface pressure cycle. The large seasonal variation in the background and occurrences of higher temporary spikes (~7 ppbv) are consistent with small localized sources of methane released from martian surface or subsurface reservoirs.</p>

<i>Swift</i> and <i>NuSTAR</i> observations of GW170817: Detection of a blue kilonova
<p>With the first direct detection of merging black holes in 2015, the era of gravitational wave (GW) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">astrophys</span></strong>ics began. A complete picture of compact object mergers, however, requires the detection of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We report ultraviolet (UV) and x-ray observations by <i>Swift</i> and the <i>Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array</i> of the EM counterpart of the binary neutron star merger GW170817. The bright, rapidly fading UV emission indicates a high mass (≈0.03 solar masses) wind-driven outflow with moderate electron fraction (<i>Y</i><sub>e</sub> ≈ 0.27). Combined with the x-ray limits, we favor an observer viewing angle of ≈30° away from the orbital rotation axis, which avoids both obscuration from the heaviest elements in the orbital plane and a direct view of any ultrarelativistic, highly collimated ejecta (a γ-ray burst afterglow).</p>

Extended gamma-ray sources around pulsars constrain the origin of the positron flux at Earth
<p>The unexpectedly high flux of cosmic-ray positrons detected at Earth may originate from nearby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">astrophys</span></strong>ical sources, dark matter, or unknown processes of cosmic-ray secondary production. We report the detection, using the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), of extended tera–electron volt gamma-ray emission coincident with the locations of two nearby middle-aged pulsars (Geminga and PSR B0656+14). The HAWC observations demonstrate that these pulsars are indeed local sources of accelerated leptons, but the measured tera–electron volt emission profile constrains the diffusion of particles away from these sources to be much slower than previously assumed. We demonstrate that the leptons emitted by these objects are therefore unlikely to be the origin of the excess positrons, which may have a more exotic origin.</p>

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes
<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a plume of material erupts from cracks in the ice. The plume contains chemical signatures of water-rock interaction between the ocean and a rocky core. We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials. The relatively high hydrogen abundance in the plume signals thermodynamic disequilibrium that favors the formation of methane from CO<sub>2</sub> in Enceladus’ ocean.</p>

Localized aliphatic organic material on the surface of Ceres
<p>Organic compounds occur in some chondritic meteorites, and their signatures on solar system bodies have been sought for decades. Spectral signatures of organics have not been unambiguously identified on the surfaces of asteroids, whereas they have been detected on cometary nuclei. Data returned by the Visible and InfraRed Mapping Spectrometer on board the Dawn spacecraft show a clear detection of an organic absorption feature at 3.4 micrometers on dwarf planet Ceres. This signature is characteristic of aliphatic organic matter and is mainly localized on a broad region of ~1000 square kilometers close to the ~50-kilometer Ernutet crater. The combined presence on Ceres of ammonia-bearing hydrated minerals, water ice, carbonates, salts, and organic material indicates a very complex chemical environment, suggesting favorable environments to prebiotic chemistry.</p>

Majorana bound state in a coupled quantum-dot hybrid-nanowire system
<p>Hybrid nanowires combining semiconductor and superconductor materials appear well suited for the creation, detection, and control of Majorana bound states (MBSs).

Electrostatic gating tuned the nanowire density to a regime of one or a few ABSs. In an applied axial magnetic field, a topological phase emerges in which ABSs move to zero energy and remain there, forming MBSs. We observed hybridization of the MBS with the end-dot bound state, which is in agreement with a numerical model. The ABS/MBS spectra provide parameters that are useful for understanding topological superconductivity in this system.</p>

Microresonator soliton dual-comb spectroscopy
<p>Measurement of optical and vibrational spectra with high resolution provides a way to identify chemical species in cluttered environments and is of general importance in many fields.

Spectra are generated directly in the electrical domain, without the need for bulky mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>ers. We demonstrate a miniature soliton-based dual-comb system that can potentially transfer the approach to a chip platform. These devices achieve high-coherence pulsed mode locking. They also feature broad, reproducible spectral envelopes, an essential feature for dual-comb spectroscopy. Our work shows the potential for integrated spectroscopy with high signal-to-noise ratios and fast acquisition rates.</p>

Flavodiiron Proteins Promote Fast and Transient O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction in <i>Chlamydomonas</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>During oxygenic photosynthesis, the reducing power generated by light energy conversion is mainly used to reduce carbon dioxide. In bacteria and archae, flavodiiron (Flv) proteins catalyze O<sub>2</sub> or NO reduction, thus protecting cells against oxidative or nitrosative stress. These proteins are found in cyanobacteria, mosses, and microalgae, but have been lost in angiosperms. Here, we used chlorophyll fluorescence and oxygen exchange measurement using [<sup>18</sup>O]-labeled O<sub>2</sub> and a membrane inlet mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectromet</span></strong>er to characterize <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii flvB</i> insertion mutants devoid of both FlvB and FlvA proteins. We show that Flv proteins are involved in a photo-dependent electron flow to oxygen, which drives most of the photosynthetic electron flow during the induction of photosynthesis. As a consequence, the chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are strongly affected in <i>flvB</i> mutants during a light transient, showing a lower PSII operating yield and a slower nonphotochemical quenching induction. Photoautotrophic growth of <i>flvB</i> mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type under constant light, but severely impaired under fluctuating light due to PSI photo damage. Remarkably, net photosynthesis of <i>flv</i> mutants was higher than in the wild type during the initial hour of a fluctuating light regime, but this advantage vanished under long-term exposure, and turned into PSI photo damage, thus explaining the marked growth retardation observed in these conditions. We conclude that the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> Flv participates in a Mehler-like reduction of O<sub>2</sub>, which drives a large part of the photosynthetic electron flow during a light transient and is thus critical for growth under fluctuating light regimes.</p>

A pathway for mitotic chromosome formation
<p>Mitotic chromosomes fold as compact arrays of chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s. To identify the pathway of mitotic chromosome formation, we combined imaging and Hi-C analysis of synchronous DT40 cell cultures with polymer simulations. Here we show that in prophase, the interphase organization is rapidly lost in a condensin-dependent manner, and arrays of consecutive 60-kilobase (kb) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s are formed. During prometaphase, ~80-kb inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s are nested within ~400-kb outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> array acquires a helical arrangement with consecutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s emanating from a central “spiral staircase” condensin scaffold. The size of helical turns progressively increases to ~12 megabases during prometaphase. Acute depletion of condensin I or II shows that nested <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s form by differential action of the two condensins, whereas condensin II is required for helical winding.</p>

Rearrangement bursts generate canonical gene fusions in bone and soft tissue tumors
<p>Sarcomas are cancers of the bone and soft tissue often defined by gene fusions. Ewing sarcoma involves fusions between <i>EWSR1</i>, a gene encoding an RNA binding protein, and E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factors. We explored how and when <i>EWSR1-ETS</i> fusions arise by studying the whole genomes of Ewing sarcomas. In 52 of 124 (42%) of tumors, the fusion gene arises by a sudden burst of complex, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-like rearrangements, a process called chromoplexy, rather than by simple reciprocal translocations. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s always contained the disease-defining fusion at the center, but they disrupted multiple additional genes. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s occurred preferentially in early replicating and transcriptionally active genomic regions. Similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s forming canonical fusions were found in three other sarcoma types. Chromoplexy-generated fusions appear to be associated with an aggressive form of Ewing sarcoma. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s arise early, giving rise to both primary and relapse Ewing sarcoma tumors, which can continue to evolve in parallel.</p>

Real-time imaging of DNA loop extrusion by condensin
<p>It has been hypothesized that SMC protein complexes such as condensin and cohesin spatially organize chromosomes by extruding DNA into large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s. We directly visualized the formation and processive extension of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s by yeast condensin in real time. Our findings constitute unambiguous evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> extrusion. We observed that a single condensin complex is able to extrude tens of kilobase pairs of DNA at a force-dependent speed of up to 1500 base pairs per second, using the energy of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. Condensin-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> extrusion was strictly asymmetric, which demonstrates that condensin anchors onto DNA and reels it in from only one side. Active DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> extrusion by SMC complexes may provide the universal unifying principle for genome organization.</p>

The Src family kinase Fgr is a transforming oncoprotein that functions independently of SH3-SH2 domain regulation
<p>Fgr is a member of the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, which are overexpressed and constitutively active in many human cancers. Fgr expression is restricted to myeloid hematopoietic cells and is markedly increased in a subset of bone marrow samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we investigated the oncogenic potential of Fgr using Rat-2 fibroblasts that do not express the kinase. Expression of either wild-type or regulatory tail-mutant constructs of Fgr promoted cellular transformation (inferred from colony formation in soft agar), which was accompanied by phosphorylation of the Fgr activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>, suggesting that the kinase domain of Fgr functions independently of regulation by its noncatalytic SH3-SH2 region. Unlike other family members, recombinant Fgr was not activated by SH3-SH2 domain ligands. However, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry data suggested that the regulatory SH3 and SH2 domains packed against the back of the kinase domain in a Src-like manner. Sequence alignment showed that the activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> of Fgr was distinct from that of all other Src family members, with proline rather than alanine at the +2 position relative to the activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> tyrosine. Substitution of the activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> of Fgr with the sequence from Src partially inhibited kinase activity and suppressed colony formation. Last, Fgr expression enhanced the sensitivity of human myeloid progenitor cells to the cytokine GM-CSF. Because its kinase domain is not sensitive to SH3-SH2–mediated control, simple overexpression of Fgr without mutation may contribute to oncogenic transformation in AML and other blood cancers.</p>

Activating mutations in MEK1 enhance homodimerization and promote tumorigenesis
<p>RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling has a well-defined role in cancer biology. Although aberrant pathway activation occurs mostly upstream of the kinase MEK, mutations in MEK are prevalent in some cancer subsets. Here, we found that cancer-related, activating mutations in MEK can be classified into two groups: those that relieve inhibitory interactions with the helix A region and those that are in-frame deletions of the β3-αC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>, which enhance MEK1 homodimerization. The former, helix A–associated mutants, are inhibited by traditional MEK inhibitors. However, we found that the increased homodimerization associated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-deletion mutants promoted intradimer cross-phosphorylation of the activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> and conferred differential resistance to MEK inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo. MEK1 dimerization was required both for its activation by the kinase RAF and for its catalytic activity toward the kinase ERK. Our findings not only identify a previously unknown group of MEK mutants and provide insight into some key steps in RAF-MEK-ERK activation but also have implications for the design of therapies targeting RAS-ERK signaling in cancers.</p>

Substrate binding allosterically relieves autoinhibition of the pseudokinase TRIB1
<p>The Tribbles family of pseudokinases recruits substrates to the ubiquitin ligase COP1 to facilitate ubiquitylation. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family transcription factors are crucial Tribbles substrates in adipocyte and myeloid cell development. We found that the TRIB1 pseudokinase was able to recruit various C/EBP family members and that the binding of C/EBPβ was attenuated by phosphorylation. To explain the mechanism of C/EBP recruitment, we solved the crystal structure of TRIB1 in complex with C/EBPα, which revealed that TRIB1 underwent a substantial conformational change relative to its substrate-free structure and bound C/EBPα in a pseudosubstrate-like manner. Crystallographic analysis and molecular dynamics and subsequent biochemical assays showed that C/EBP binding triggered allosteric changes that link substrate recruitment to COP1 binding. These findings offer a view of pseudokinase regulation with striking parallels to bona fide kinase regulation—by means of the activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> and αC helix—and raise the possibility of small molecules targeting either the activation “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-in” or “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-out” conformations of Tribbles pseudokinases.</p>

Rev-erbα dynamically modulates chromatin looping to control circadian gene transcription
<p>Mammalian physiology exhibits 24-hour cyclicity due to circadian rhythms of gene expression controlled by transcription factors that constitute molecular clocks. Core clock transcription factors bind to the genome at enhancer sequences to regulate circadian gene expression, but not all binding sites are equally functional. We found that in mice, circadian gene expression in the liver is controlled by rhythmic chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters. Rev-erbα, a core repressive transcription factor of the clock, opposes functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> formation between Rev-erbα–regulated enhancers and circadian target gene promoters by recruitment of the NCoR-HDAC3 co-repressor complex, histone deacetylation, and eviction of the elongation factor BRD4 and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>ing factor MED1. Thus, a repressive arm of the molecular clock operates by rhythmically modulating chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s to control circadian gene transcription.</p>

A mitosis-specific and R loop–driven ATR pathway promotes faithful chromosome segregation
<p>The ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase is crucial for DNA damage and replication stress responses. Here, we describe an unexpected role of ATR in mitosis. Acute inhibition or degradation of ATR in mitosis induces whole-chromosome missegregation. The effect of ATR ablation is not due to altered cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity, DNA damage responses, or unscheduled DNA synthesis but to loss of an ATR function at centromeres. In mitosis, ATR localizes to centromeres through Aurora A–regulated association with centromere protein F (CENP-F), allowing ATR to engage replication protein A (RPA)–coated centromeric R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s. As ATR is activated at centromeres, it stimulates Aurora B through Chk1, preventing formation of lagging chromosomes. Thus, a mitosis-specific and R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>–driven ATR pathway acts at centromeres to promote faithful chromosome segregation, revealing functions of R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s and ATR in suppressing chromosome instability.</p>

VEGF–neuropilin-2 signaling promotes stem-like traits in breast cancer cells by TAZ-mediated repression of the Rac GAP β2-chimaerin
<p>The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling in cancer is not only well known in the context of angiogenesis but also important in the functional regulation of tumor cells. Autocrine VEGF signaling mediated by its co-receptors called neuropilins (NRPs) appears to be essential for sustaining the proliferation and survival of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in mediating tumor growth, progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involved in VEGF-mediated support of CSCs is critical to successfully treating cancer patients. The expression of the Hippo effector TAZ is associated with breast CSCs and confers stem cell–like properties. We found that VEGF-NRP2 signaling contributed to the activation of TAZ in various breast cancer cells, which mediated a positive feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> that promoted mammosphere formation. VEGF-NRP2 signaling activated the GTPase Rac1, which inhibited the Hippo kinase LATS, thus leading to TAZ activity. In a complex with the transcription factor TEAD, TAZ then bound and repressed the promoter of the gene encoding the Rac GTPase-activating protein (Rac GAP) β2-chimaerin. By activating GTP hydrolysis, Rac GAPs effectively turn off Rac signaling; hence, the TAZ-mediated repression of β2-chimaerin resulted in sustained Rac1 activity in CSCs. Depletion of β2-chimaerin in non-CSCs increased Rac1 activity, TAZ abundance, and mammosphere formation. Analysis of a breast cancer patient database revealed an inverse correlation between β2-chimaerin and TAZ expression in tumors. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for β2-chimaerin in a feed-forward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> of TAZ activation and the acquisition of CSC properties.</p>

Apoptosis propagates through the cytoplasm as trigger waves
<p>Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved form of programmed cell death critical for development and tissue homeostasis in animals. The apoptotic control network includes several positive feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s that may allow apoptosis to spread through the cytoplasm in self-regenerating trigger waves. We tested this possibility in cell-free <i>Xenopus laevis</i> egg extracts and observed apoptotic trigger waves with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute. Fractionation and inhibitor studies implicated multiple feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s in generating the waves. Apoptotic oocytes and eggs exhibited surface waves with speeds of ~30 micrometers per minute, which were tightly correlated with caspase activation. Thus, apoptosis spreads through trigger waves in both extracts and intact cells. Our findings show how apoptosis can spread over large distances within a cell and emphasize the general importance of trigger waves in cell signaling.</p>

Structure basis for RNA-guided DNA degradation by Cascade and Cas3
<p>Type I CRISPR-Cas system features a sequential target-searching and degradation process on double-stranded DNA by the RNA-guided Cascade (CRISPR associated complex for antiviral defense) complex and the nuclease-helicase fusion enzyme Cas3, respectively. Here, we present a 3.7-angstrom-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Type I-E Cascade/R-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>/Cas3 complex, poised to initiate DNA degradation. Cas3 distinguishes Cascade conformations and only captures the R-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>–forming Cascade, to avoid cleaving partially complementary targets. Its nuclease domain recruits the nontarget strand (NTS) DNA at a bulged region for the nicking of single-stranded DNA. An additional 4.7-angstrom-resolution cryo-EM structure captures the postnicking state, in which the severed NTS retracts to the helicase entrance, to be threaded for adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent processive degradation. These snapshots form the basis for understanding RNA-guided DNA degradation in Type I-E CRISPR-Cas systems.</p>

Structural mechanisms of centromeric nucleosome recognition by the kinetochore protein CENP-N
<p>Accurate chromosome segregation requires the proper assembly of kinetochore proteins. A key step in this process is the recognition of the histone H3 variant CENP-A in the centromeric nucleosome by the kinetochore protein CENP-N. We report cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological studies of the interaction between the CENP-A nucleosome and CENP-N. We show that human CENP-N confers binding specificity through interactions with the L1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> of CENP-A, stabilized by electrostatic interactions with the nucleosomal DNA. Mutational analyses demonstrate analogous interactions in <i>Xenopus</i>, which are further supported by residue-swapping experiments involving the L1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> of CENP-A. Our results are consistent with the coevolution of CENP-N and CENP-A and establish the structural basis for recognition of the CENP-A nucleosome to enable kinetochore assembly and centromeric chromatin organization.</p>

We show that in squid, patchy colloidal physics resulted from an evolutionary radiation of globular S-crystallin proteins. Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments on lens tissue show colloidal gels of S-crystallins at all radial positions. Sparse lens materials form via low-valence linkages between disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s protruding from the protein surface. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s are polydisperse and bind via a set of hydrogen bonds between disordered side chains. Peripheral lens regions with low particle valence form stable, volume-spanning gels at low density, whereas central regions with higher average valence gel at higher densities. The proteins demonstrate an evolved set of linkers for self-assembly of nanoparticles into volumetric materials.</p>

Ratchet-like polypeptide translocation mechanism of the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp104
<p>Hsp100 polypeptide translocases are conserved members of the AAA+ family (adenosine triphosphatases associated with diverse cellular activities) that maintain proteostasis by unfolding aberrant and toxic proteins for refolding or proteolytic degradation. The Hsp104 disaggregase from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> solubilizes stress-induced amorphous aggregates and amyloids. The structural basis for substrate recognition and translocation is unknown. Using a model substrate (casein), we report cryo–electron microscopy structures at near-atomic resolution of Hsp104 in different translocation states. Substrate interactions are mediated by conserved, pore-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> tyrosines that contact an 80-angstrom-long unfolded polypeptide along the axial channel. Two protomers undergo a ratchet-like conformational change that advances pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>–substrate interactions by two amino acids. These changes are coupled to activation of specific nucleotide hydrolysis sites and, when transmitted around the hexamer, reveal a processive rotary translocation mechanism and substrate-responsive flexibility during Hsp104-catalyzed disaggregation.</p>

<i>Bacillus subtilis</i> SMC complexes juxtapose chromosome arms as they travel from origin to terminus
<p>Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes play critical roles in chromosome dynamics in virtually all organisms, but how they function remains poorly understood.

Here we provide evidence that these ring-shaped assemblies tether the left and right chromosome arms together while traveling from the origin to the terminus (>2 megabases) at rates >50 kilobases per minute. Condensin movement scales linearly with time, providing evidence for an active transport mechanism. These data support a model in which SMC complexes function by processively enlarging DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> formation followed by processive enlargement provides a mechanism by which condensin complexes compact and resolve sister chromatids in mitosis and by which cohesin generates topologically associating domains during interphase.</p>

BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 Associates with Immune Receptors and Is Required for Immune Responses
<p>Plants utilize cell surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMP/DAMPs) and initiate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Here, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 (BSK5), a member of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily XII, in PRR-initiated immunity. BSK5 localized to the plant cell periphery, interacted in yeast and in planta with multiple receptor-like kinases, including the ELONGATION FACTOR-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and PEP1 RECEPTOR1 (PEPR1) PRRs, and was phosphorylated in vitro by PEPR1 and EFR in the kinase activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>. Consistent with a role in PTI, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants displayed enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and to the fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Furthermore, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants were impaired in several immune responses induced by the elf18, pep1, and flg22 PAMP/DAMPs, including resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>B. cinerea</i>, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition at the cell wall, and enhanced <i>PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1</i> gene expression. However, <i>bsk5</i> plants were not affected in PAMP/DAMP activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and expression of the <i>FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> or the WRKY domain-containing gene <i>WRKY29</i>. BSK5 variants mutated in the BSK5 myristoylation site, ATP-binding site, and kinase activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> failed to complement defective PTI phenotypes of <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants, suggesting that localization to the cell periphery, kinase activity, and phosphorylation by PRRs are critical for the function of BSK5 in PTI.

Polar Localization of the Borate Exporter BOR1 Requires AP2-Dependent Endocytosis
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element in plants but is toxic when it accumulates to high levels. In root cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the borate exporter BOR1 is polarly localized in the plasma membrane toward the stele side for directional transport of B. Upon high-B supply, BOR1 is rapidly internalized and degraded in the vacuole. The polar localization and B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 are mediated by endocytosis from the plasma membrane. To dissect the endocytic pathways mediating the polar localization and vacuolar sorting, we investigated the contribution of the clathrin adaptor protein, ADAPTOR PROTEIN2 (AP2) complex, to BOR1 trafficking. In the mutants lacking µ- or σ-subunits of the AP2 complex, the polar localization and constitutive endocytosis of BOR1 under low-B conditions were dramatically disturbed. A coimmunoprecipitation assay showed association of the AP2 complex with BOR1, while it was independent of YxxΦ sorting motifs, which are in a cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> of BOR1. A yeast two-hybrid assay supported the interaction of the AP2 complex µ-subunit with the C-terminal tail but not with the YxxΦ motifs in the cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> of BOR1. Intriguingly, lack of the AP2 subunit did not affect the B-induced rapid internalization/vacuolar sorting of BOR1. Consistent with defects in the polar localization, the AP2 complex mutants showed hypersensitivity to B deficiency. Our results indicate that AP2-dependent endocytosis maintains the polar localization of BOR1 to support plant growth under low-B conditions, whereas the B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 is mediated through an AP2-independent endocytic pathway.</p>

Identification of ASYNAPTIC4, a Component of the Meiotic Chromosome Axis
<p>During the leptotene stage of prophase I of meiosis, chromatids become organized into a linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>ed array via a protein axis that forms along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> bases. Establishment of the axis is essential for the subsequent synapsis of the homologous chromosome pairs and the progression of recombination to form genetic crossovers. Here, we describe ASYNAPTIC4 (ASY4), a meiotic axis protein in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). ASY4 is a small coiled-coil protein that exhibits limited sequence similarity with the carboxyl-terminal region of the axis protein ASY3. We used enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged ASY4 to show that ASY4 localizes to the chromosome axis throughout prophase I. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that ASY4 interacts with ASY1 and ASY3, and yeast two-hybrid analysis confirmed a direct interaction between ASY4 and ASY3. Mutants lacking full-length ASY4 exhibited defective axis formation and were unable to complete synapsis. Although the initiation of recombination appeared to be unaffected in the <i>asy4</i> mutant, the number of crossovers was reduced significantly, and crossovers tended to group in the distal parts of the chromosomes. We conclude that ASY4 is required for normal axis and crossover formation. Furthermore, our data suggest that ASY3/ASY4 are the functional homologs of the mammalian SYCP2/SYCP3 axial components.</p>

The MtDMI2-MtPUB2 Negative Feedback Loop Plays a Role in Nodulation Homeostasis
<p>DOES NOT MAKE INFECTION 2 (MtDMI2) is a Leu rich repeat-type receptor kinase required for signal transduction in the <i>Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> symbiosis pathway. However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in nodulation homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel plant U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulation were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of plants in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi plants) exhibited impaired infection threads, fewer nodules, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control plants transformed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants were transformed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer nodules than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented plants showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitination activity, and their nodulation phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi plants transformed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulation of nodulation via MtNIN, plays an important role in nodulation homeostasis.</p>

Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase 1 Is Regulated by Its N-Terminal Domain in Response to Allosteric Effectors
<p>Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is an integral membrane enzyme catalyzing the final and committed step in the acyl-coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent biosynthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). The biochemical regulation of TAG assembly remains one of the least understood areas of primary metabolism to date. Here, we report that the hydrophilic N-terminal domain of <i>Brassica napus</i> DGAT1 (BnaDGAT1<sub>1-113</sub>) regulates activity based on acyl-CoA/CoA levels. The N-terminal domain is not necessary for acyltransferase activity and is composed of an intrinsically disordered region and a folded segment. We show that the disordered region has an autoinhibitory function and a dimerization interface, which appears to mediate positive cooperativity, whereas the folded segment of the cytosolic region was found to have an allosteric site for acyl-CoA/CoA. Under increasing acyl-CoA levels, the binding of acyl-CoA with this noncatalytic site facilitates homotropic allosteric activation. Enzyme activation, on the other hand, is prevented under limiting acyl-CoA conditions (low acyl-CoA-to-CoA ratio), whereby CoA acts as a noncompetitive feedback inhibitor through interaction with the same folded segment.

Poplar MYB115 and MYB134 Transcription Factors Regulate Proanthocyanidin Synthesis and Structure
<p>The accumulation of proanthocyanidins is regulated by a complex of transcription factors composed of R2R3 MYB, basic helix-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-helix, and WD40 proteins that activate the promoters of biosynthetic genes. In poplar (genus <i>Populus</i>), MYB134 is known to regulate proanthocyanidin biosynthesis by activating key flavonoid genes. Here, we characterize a second MYB regulator of proanthocyanidins, MYB115. Transgenic poplar overexpressing MYB115 showed a high-proanthocyanidin phenotype and reduced salicinoid accumulation, similar to the effects of MYB134 overexpression. Transcriptomic analysis of MYB115- and MYB134-overexpressing poplar plants identified a set of common up-regulated genes encoding proanthocyanidin biosynthetic enzymes and several novel uncharacterized MYB transcriptional repressors. Transient expression experiments demonstrated the capacity of both MYB134 and MYB115 to activate flavonoid promoters, but only in the presence of a basic helix-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-helix cofactor. Yeast two-hybrid experiments confirmed the direct interaction of these transcription factors. The unexpected identification of dihydromyricetin in leaf extracts of both MYB115- and MYB134-overexpressing poplar led to the discovery of enhanced flavonoid B-ring hydroxylation and an increased proportion of prodelphinidins in proanthocyanidin of the transgenics. The dramatic hydroxylation phenotype of MYB115 overexpressors is likely due to the up-regulation of both flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylases and cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>5</sub>. Overall, this work provides new insight into the complexity of the gene regulatory network for proanthocyanidin synthesis in poplar.</p>

Rice Cellulose SynthaseA8 Plant-Conserved Region Is a Coiled-Coil at the Catalytic Core Entrance
<p>The crystallographic structure of a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cellulose synthase, OsCesA8, plant-conserved region (P-CR), one of two unique domains in the catalytic domain of plant CesAs, was solved to 2.4 ÅÅ resolution. Two antiparallel α-helices form a coiled-coil domain linked by a large extended connector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> containing a conserved trio of aromatic residues. The P-CR structure was fit into a molecular envelope for the P-CR domain derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data. The P-CR structure and molecular envelope, combined with a homology-based chain trace of the CesA8 catalytic core, were modeled into a previously determined CesA8 small-angle X-ray scattering molecular envelope to produce a detailed topological model of the CesA8 catalytic domain. The predicted position for the P-CR domain from the molecular docking models places the P-CR connector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> into a hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic core, with the coiled-coil aligned near the entrance of the substrate UDP-glucose into the active site. In this configuration, the P-CR coiled-coil alone is unlikely to regulate substrate access to the active site, but it could interact with other domains of CesA, accessory proteins, or other CesA catalytic domains to control substrate delivery.</p>

An NADPH-Oxidase/Polyamine Oxidase Feedback Loop Controls Oxidative Burst Under Salinity
<p>The apoplastic polyamine oxidase (PAO) catalyzes the oxidation of the higher polyamines spermidine and spermine, contributing to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) accumulation. However, it is yet unclear whether apoplastic PAO is part of a network that coordinates the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under salinity or if it acts independently. Here, we unravel that NADPH oxidase and apoplastic PAO cooperate to control the accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxides (O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>) in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). To examine to what extent apoplastic PAO constitutes part of a ROS-generating network, we examined ROS accumulation in guard cells of plants overexpressing or down-regulating apoplastic PAO (lines S2.2 and A2, respectively) or down-regulating NADPH oxidase (line AS-<i>NtRbohD</i>/<i>F</i>). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed that, under salinity, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased in S2.2 and decreased in A2 compared with the wild type. Surprisingly, the O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-So showed that O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> levels correlated positively with that of apoplastic PAO (i.e. showed high and low levels in S2.2 and A2, respectively). By using AS-<i>NtRbohD/F</i> lines and a pharmacological approach, we could show that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> accumulation at the onset of salinity stress was dependent on NADPH oxidase, indicating that NADPH oxidase is upstream of apoplastic PAO. Our results suggest that NADPH oxidase and the apoplastic PAO form a feed-forward ROS amplification <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>, which impinges on oxidative state and culminates in the execution of programmed cell death. We propose that the PAO/NADPH oxidase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> is a central hub in the plethora of responses controlling salt stress tolerance, with potential functions extending beyond stress tolerance.</p>

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a programmed walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion pattern (optic flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> visual stimuli. We found that the use of optic flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as optic flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant optic flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the programmed walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of programmed behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of optic flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

Phytochromes and Phytochrome Interacting Factors
<p>The basic helix-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-helix domain-containing transcription factors that interact physically with the red and far-red light photoreceptors, phytochromes, are called PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs). In the last two decades, the phytochrome-PIF signaling module has been shown to be conserved from <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> to higher plants. Exciting recent studies highlight the discovery of at least four distinct kinases (PPKs, CK2, BIN2, and phytochrome itself) and four families of ubiquitin ligases (SCF<sup>EBF1/2</sup>, CUL3<sup>LRB</sup>, CUL3<sup>BOP</sup>, and CUL4<sup>COP1-SPA</sup>) that regulate PIF abundance both in dark and light conditions. This review discusses these recent discoveries with a focus on the central phytochrome signaling mechanisms that have a profound impact on plant growth and development in response to light.</p>

Biochemical and Structural Analysis of Substrate Specificity of a Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase
<p>Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is the first enzyme of the general phenylpropanoid pathway catalyzing the nonoxidative elimination of ammonia from <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine to give <i>trans</i>-cinnamate. In monocots, PAL also displays tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) activity, leading to the formation of <i>p</i>-coumaric acid. The catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of a major PAL from sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>; SbPAL1), a strategic plant for bioenergy production, were deduced from crystal structures, molecular docking, site-directed mutagenesis, and kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. This first crystal structure of a monocotyledonous PAL displayed a unique conformation in its flexible inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> of the 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) domain compared with that of dicotyledonous plants. The side chain of histidine-123 in the MIO domain dictated the distance between the catalytic MIO prosthetic group created from <sup>189</sup>Ala-Ser-Gly<sup>191</sup> residues and the bound <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine and <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine, conferring the deamination reaction through either the Friedel-Crafts or E<sub>2</sub> reaction mechanism. Several recombinant mutant SbPAL1 enzymes were generated via structure-guided mutagenesis, one of which, H123F-SbPAL1, has 6.2 times greater PAL activity without significant TAL activity. Additional PAL isozymes of sorghum were characterized and categorized into three groups. Taken together, this approach identified critical residues and explained substrate preferences among PAL isozymes in sorghum and other monocots, which can serve as the basis for the engineering of plants with enhanced biomass conversion properties, disease resistance, or nutritional quality.</p>

The Kinase OsCPK4 Regulates a Buffering Mechanism That Fine-Tunes Innate Immunity
<p>The calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 has been demonstrated to play important roles in salt and drought tolerance, plant growth, and development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying OsCPK4 function in rice immunity. In this study, we demonstrated that the generation of oxidative burst and pathogenesis-related gene expression triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns were significantly enhanced in the <i>oscpk4</i> mutants. These mutant lines are more resistant to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases than the wild-type plants, indicating that OsCPK4 negatively regulates innate immunity in rice. OsCPK4 was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176. OsRLCK176 accumulation is negatively regulated by OsCPK4. Interestingly, the kinase-dead OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation more strongly than the wild-type protein. OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 mutually phosphorylate each other and form a feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>. Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 contribute to the stability of OsRLCK176. These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation and restricts plant defenses, whereas the activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 degradation machinery, thus enhancing plant immunity. Collectively, the study proposes a novel defense buffering mechanism mediated by OsCPK4, which fine-tunes microbe-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice.</p>

BcXYG1, a Secreted Xyloglucanase from <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, Triggers Both Cell Death and Plant Immune Responses
<p>In search of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> cell death-inducing proteins, we found a xyloglucanase (BcXYG1) that induced strong necrosis and a resistance response in dicot plants. Expression of the <i>BcXYG1</i> gene was strongly induced during the first 12 h post inoculation, and analysis of disease dynamics using PathTrack showed that a <i>B. cinerea</i> strain overexpressing <i>BcXYG1</i> produced early local necrosis, supporting a role of BcXYG1 as an early cell death-inducing factor. The xyloglucanase activity of BcXYG1 was not necessary for the induction of necrosis and plant resistance, as a mutant of BcXYG1 lacking the xyloglucanase enzymatic activity retained both functions. Residues in two exposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s on the surface of BcXYG1 were found to be necessary for the induction of cell death but not to induce plant resistance. Further analyses showed that BcXYG1 is apoplastic and possibly interacts with the proteins of the plant cell membrane and also that the BcXYG1 cell death-promoting signal is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases BAK1 and SOBIR1. Our findings support the role of cell death-inducing proteins in establishing the infection of necrotrophic pathogens and highlight the recognition of fungal apoplastic proteins by the plant immune system as an important mechanism of resistance against this class of pathogens.</p>

Autophosphorylation Affects Substrate-Binding Affinity of Tobacco Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Dependent Protein Kinase1
<p>Protein kinases regulate diverse physiological processes. Because many kinases preserve inherent autophosphorylation capability, autophosphorylation appears to be one of the most important mechanisms for cellular signaling. However, physiological functions of autophosphorylation are still largely unknown, other than the self-activation by phosphorylation of activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> in the catalytic domain. REPRESSION OF SHOOT GROWTH (RSG) is the transcription factor involved in gibberellin (GA) feedback regulation. The tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protein kinase, NtCDPK1, phosphorylates RSG, resulting in the negative regulation of RSG. NtCDPK1 was previously shown to be autophosphorylated in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the functional importance of autophosphorylation in NtCDPK1. Ser-6 and Thr-21 were identified as autophosphorylation sites of NtCDPK1. Autophosphorylation not only reduced the binding affinity of NtCDPK1 for RSG, but also inhibited the homodimerization of NtCDPK1. Furthermore, autophosphorylation decreased the phosphorylation efficiency of RSG yet increased that of myelin basic protein. Ser-6 and Thr-21 of NtCDPK1 were phosphorylated in response to GAs in plants. The substitution of these autophosphorylation sites with Ala enhanced the NtCDPK1 overexpression-induced sensitization of seeds to a GA biosynthetic inhibitor during germination. These results suggest new functions of autophosphorylation in CDPKs, namely, autophosphorylation can prevent the excessive phosphorylation of substrates and alter the substrate preference of CDPKs.</p>

Unique Motifs and Length of Hairpin in Oleosin Target the Cytosolic Side of Endoplasmic Reticulum and Budding Lipid Droplet
<p>Plant cytosolic lipid droplets (LDs) are covered with a layer of phospholipids and oleosin and were extensively studied before those in mammals and yeast. Oleosin has short amphipathic N- and C-terminal peptides flanking a conserved 72-residue hydrophobic hairpin, which penetrates and stabilizes the LD. Oleosin is synthesized on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and extracts ER-budding LDs to cytosol. To delineate the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LD, we have expressed modified-oleosin genes in <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> for transient expression and tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY2 cells for stable transformation. The results have identified oleosin motifs for targeting ER-LD and oleosin as the sole molecule responsible for budding-LD entering cytosol. Both the N-terminal and C-terminal peptides are not required for the targeting. The hairpin, including its entire length, initial N-portion residues, and hairpin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> of three Pro and one Ser residues, as well as the absence of an N-terminal ER-targeting peptide, are necessary for oleosin targeting ER and moving onto budding LDs and extracting them to cytosol. In a reverse approach, eliminations of these necessities allow the modified oleosin to enter the ER lumen and extract budding LDs to the ER lumen. Modified oleosin with an added vacuole signal peptide transports the ER-luminal LDs to vacuoles. The overall findings define the mechanism of oleosin targeting ER-LDs and extracting budding LDs to the cytosol as well as reveal potential applications.</p>

In Vitro Characterization of Thermostable CAM Rubisco Activase Reveals a Rubisco Interacting Surface Loop
<p>To maintain metabolic flux through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in higher plants, dead-end inhibited complexes of Rubisco must constantly be engaged and remodeled by the molecular chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca). In C3 plants, the thermolability of Rca is responsible for the deactivation of Rubisco and reduction of photosynthesis at moderately elevated temperatures. We reasoned that crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants must possess thermostable Rca to support Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle flux during the day when stomata are closed. A comparative biochemical characterization of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Agave tequilana</i> Rca isoforms demonstrated that the CAM Rca isoforms are approximately10°C more thermostable than the C3 isoforms. Agave Rca also possessed a much higher in vitro biochemical activity, even at low assay temperatures. Mixtures of rice and agave Rca form functional hetero-oligomers in vitro, but only the rice isoforms denature at nonpermissive temperatures. The high thermostability and activity of agave Rca mapped to the N-terminal 244 residues. A Glu-217-Gln amino acid substitution was found to confer high Rca activity to rice Rca. Further mutational analysis suggested that Glu-217 restricts the flexibility of the α4-β4 surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> that interacts with Rubisco via Lys-216. CAM plants thus promise to be a source of highly functional, thermostable Rca candidates for thermal fortification of crop photosynthesis. Careful characterization of their properties will likely reveal further protein-protein interaction motifs to enrich our mechanistic model of Rca function.</p>

Cooperative Regulatory Functions of miR858 and MYB83 during Cyst Nematode Parasitism
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) recently have been established as key regulators of transcriptome reprogramming that define cell function and identity. Nevertheless, the molecular functions of the greatest number of miRNA genes remain to be determined. Here, we report cooperative regulatory functions of miR858 and its MYB83 transcription factor target gene in transcriptome reprogramming during <i>Heterodera</i> cyst nematode parasitism of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Gene expression analyses and promoter-GUS fusion assays documented a role of miR858 in posttranscriptional regulation of <i>MYB83</i> in the <i>Heterodera schachtii-</i>induced feeding sites, the syncytia. Constitutive overexpression of miR858 interfered with <i>H. schachtii</i> parasitism of Arabidopsis, leading to reduced susceptibility, while reduced miR858 abundance enhanced plant susceptibility. Similarly, <i>MYB83</i> expression increases were conducive to nematode infection because overexpression of a noncleavable coding sequence of <i>MYB83</i> significantly increased plant susceptibility, whereas a <i>myb83</i> mutation rendered the plants less susceptible. In addition, RNA-seq analysis revealed that genes involved in hormone signaling pathways, defense response, glucosinolate biosynthesis, cell wall modification, sugar transport, and transcriptional control are the key etiological factors by which MYB83 facilitates nematode parasitism of Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we discovered that miR858-mediated silencing of <i>MYB83</i> is tightly regulated through a feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> that might contribute to fine-tuning the expression of more than a thousand of MYB83-regulated genes in the <i>H. schachtii</i>-induced syncytium. Together, our results suggest a role of the miR858-MYB83 regulatory system in finely balancing gene expression patterns during <i>H. schachtii</i> parasitism of Arabidopsis to ensure optimal cellular function.</p>

Scanning for New BRI1 Mutations via TILLING Analysis
<p>The identification and characterization of a mutational spectrum for a specific protein can help to elucidate its detailed cellular functions. BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1), a multidomain transmembrane receptor-like kinase, is a major receptor of brassinosteroids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Within the last two decades, over 20 different <i>bri1</i> mutant alleles have been identified, which helped to determine the significance of each domain within BRI1. To further understand the molecular mechanisms of BRI1, we tried to identify additional alleles via targeted induced local lesions in genomes. Here, we report our identification of 83 new point mutations in <i>BRI1</i>, including nine mutations that exhibit an allelic series of typical <i>bri1</i> phenotypes, from subtle to severe morphological alterations. We carried out biochemical analyses to investigate possible mechanisms of these mutations in affecting brassinosteroid signaling. A number of interesting mutations have been isolated via this study. For example, <i>bri1-702</i>, the only weak allele identified so far with a mutation in the activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>, showed reduced autophosphorylation activity. <i>bri1-705</i>, a subtle allele with a mutation in the extracellular portion, disrupts the interaction of BRI1 with its ligand brassinolide and coreceptor BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1. <i>bri1-706</i>, with a mutation in the extracellular portion, is a subtle defective mutant. Surprisingly, root inhibition analysis indicated that it is largely insensitive to exogenous brassinolide treatment. In this study, we found that <i>bri1-301</i> possesses kinase activity in vivo, clarifying a previous report arguing that kinase activity may not be necessary for the function of BRI1. These data provide additional insights into our understanding of the early events in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway.</p>

Target RNA Secondary Structure Is a Major Determinant of miR159 Efficacy
<p>In plants, microRNA (miRNA)-target complementarity has long been considered the predominant factor determining the silencing outcome of the miRNA-target interaction, although the efficacy of such interactions have rarely been appraised in plants. Here, we perform in planta silencing efficacy assays on seven Arabidopsis <i>MYB</i> genes, all of which contain conserved miR159-binding sites of analogous complementarity. These genes were found to be differentially silenced by miR159; <i>MYB81</i>, <i>MYB97</i>, <i>MYB101</i>, <i>MYB104</i>, and <i>DUO1</i> were all poorly silenced, whereas <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were strongly silenced. Curiously, this is consistent with previous genetic analysis defining <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> as the major functional targets of miR159. Neither the free energy of miR159-target complementarity, nor miRNA binding site accessibility, as determined by flanking region AU content, could fully explain the discrepancy of miR159 silencing efficacy. Instead, we found that <i>MYB33</i> and <i>MYB65</i> were both predicted to contain a distinctive RNA secondary structure abutting the miR159 binding site. The structure is composed of two stem-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s (SLs) that are predicted to form in <i>MYB33</i>/65 homologs of species as evolutionary distant as gymnosperms. Functional analysis found that the RNA structure in <i>MYB33</i> correlated with strong silencing efficacy; introducing mutations to disrupt either SL attenuated miR159 efficacy, while introducing complementary mutations to restore the SLs, but not the sequence, restored strong miR159-mediated silencing. Therefore, it appears that this RNA secondary structure demarcates <i>MYB33</i>/<i>65</i> as sensitive targets of miR159, which underpins the narrow functional specificity of Arabidopsis miR159.</p>

Origins and Evolution of Stomatal Development
<p>The fossil record suggests stomata-like pores were present on the surfaces of land plants over 400 million years ago. Whether stomata arose once or whether they arose independently across newly evolving land plant lineages has long been a matter of debate. In Arabidopsis, a genetic toolbox has been identified that tightly controls stomatal development and patterning. This includes the basic helix-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-helix (bHLH) transcription factors <i>SPEECHLESS</i> (<i>SPCH</i>), <i>MUTE</i>, <i>FAMA</i>, and <i>ICE/SCREAMs</i> (<i>SCRMs</i>), which promote stomatal formation. These factors are regulated via a signaling cascade, which includes mobile <i>EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR</i> (<i>EPF</i>) peptides to enforce stomatal spacing. Mosses and hornworts, the most ancient extant lineages to possess stomata, possess orthologs of these Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomatal toolbox genes, and manipulation in the model bryophyte <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> has shown that the bHLH and EPF components are also required for moss stomatal development and patterning. This supports an ancient and tightly conserved genetic origin of stomata. Here, we review recent discoveries and, by interrogating newly available plant genomes, we advance the story of stomatal development and patterning across land plant evolution. Furthermore, we identify potential orthologs of the key toolbox genes in a hornwort, further supporting a single ancient genetic origin of stomata in the ancestor to all stomatous land plants.</p>

A Mutation in the bHLH Domain of the SPCH Transcription Factor Uncovers a BR-Dependent Mechanism for Stomatal Development<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The asymmetric cell divisions necessary for stomatal lineage initiation and progression in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) require the function of the basic helix-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-helix (bHLH) transcription factor <i>SPEECHLESS</i> (<i>SPCH</i>). Mutants lacking <i>SPCH</i> do not produce stomata or lineages. Here, we isolated a new <i>spch-5</i> allele carrying a point mutation in the bHLH domain that displayed normal growth, but had an extremely low number of sometimes clustered stomata in the leaves, whereas the hypocotyls did not have any stomata. In vivo tracking of leaf epidermal cell divisions, combined with marker lines and genetic analysis, showed that the <i>spch-5</i> leaf phenotype is dosage dependent and results from the decreased ability to initiate and amplify lineages, defects in asymmetric cell fate allocation, and misorientation of asymmetric division planes. Notably, application of brassinosteroids (BRs) partly rescued the stomatal leaf phenotype of <i>spch-5</i>. Transcriptomic analysis combining <i>spch-5</i> with BR treatments revealed that the expression of a set of SPCH target genes was restored by BRs. Our results also show that BR-dependent stomata formation and expression of some, but not all, SPCH target genes require the integrity of the bHLH domain of SPCH.</p>

Transcription Factor Interplay between LEAFY and APETALA1/CAULIFLOWER during Floral Initiation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transcription factors LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1), together with the AP1 paralog CAULIFLOWER (CAL), control the onset of flower development in a partially redundant manner. This redundancy is thought to be mediated, at least in part, through the regulation of a shared set of target genes. However, whether these genes are independently or cooperatively regulated by LFY and AP1/CAL is currently unknown. To better understand the regulatory relationship between LFY and AP1/CAL and to obtain deeper insights into the control of floral initiation, we monitored the activity of LFY in the absence of AP1/CAL function. We found that the regulation of several known LFY target genes is unaffected by AP1/CAL perturbation, while others appear to require AP1/CAL activity. Furthermore, we obtained evidence that LFY and AP1/CAL control the expression of some genes in an antagonistic manner. Notably, these include key regulators of floral initiation such as <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TFL1</i>), which had been previously reported to be directly repressed by both LFY and AP1. We show here that <i>TFL1</i> expression is suppressed by AP1 but promoted by LFY. We further demonstrate that LFY has an inhibitory effect on flower formation in the absence of AP1/CAL activity. We propose that LFY and AP1/CAL act as part of an incoherent feed-forward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>, a network motif where two interconnected pathways or transcription factors act in opposite directions on a target gene, to control the establishment of a stable developmental program for the formation of flowers.</p>

Reconstitution of Abscisic Acid Signaling from the Receptor to DNA via bHLH Transcription Factors
<p>The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) confers drought tolerance in plants through stomatal closure and regulation of gene expression. The complex consisting of the ABA receptor PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE/REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTOR (PYR/RCAR), type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C), and SNF1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) has a key role in ABA signaling. Basic helix-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator ABA-RESPONSIVE KINASE SUBSTRATE1 (AKS1, also known as FBH3) is released from DNA by phosphorylation-induced monomerization in response to ABA in guard cells. Here we reconstituted the release of AKS1 from DNA via the ABA signaling core complex in vitro. We first obtained evidence to confirm that AKS1 is an endogenous substrate for SnRK2s. Phosphorylation of AKS1 and activation of SnRK2 showed the same time course in response to ABA in guard cells. AKS1 was bound to SnRK2.6 in vivo. Three ABA-responsive SnRK2s (SnRK2.2/SRK2D, SnRK2.3/SRK2I, and SnRK2.6/SRK2E/OST1) phosphorylated AKS1 in vitro, and the phosphorylation was eliminated by the triple mutation of SnRK2s in plants. We reconstituted the AKS1 phosphorylation in vitro via the signaling complex containing the ABA receptor PYR1, a PP2C, HYPERSENSITIVE TO ABA1 (HAB1), and a protein kinase, SnRK2.6 in response to ABA. We further reconstituted the release of AKS1 from the target gene of <i>POTASSIUM CHANNEL IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 1</i> (<i>KAT1</i>) via the complex in response to ABA. These results demonstrate that AKS1 provides a link between the signaling complex and ABA-responsive genes and furnish evidence for a minimal signaling mechanism from ABA perception to DNA.</p>

Brassinosteroid Biosynthesis Is Modulated via a Transcription Factor Cascade of COG1, PIF4, and PIF5
<p>Brassinosteroids (BRs) are essential phytohormones regulating various developmental and physiological processes during normal growth and development. <i>cog1-3D</i> (<i>cogwheel1-3D</i>) was identified as an activation-tagged genetic modifier of <i>bri1-5</i>, an intermediate BR receptor mutant in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>COG1</i> encodes a Dof-type transcription factor found previously to act as a negative regulator of the phytochrome signaling pathway. <i>cog1-3D</i> single mutants show an elongated hypocotyl phenotype under light conditions. A loss-of-function mutant or inducible expression of a dominant negative form of <i>COG1</i> in the wild type results in an opposite phenotype. A BR profile assay indicated that BR levels are elevated in <i>cog1-3D</i> seedlings. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that several key BR biosynthetic genes are significantly up-regulated in <i>cog1-3D</i> compared with those of the wild type. Two basic helix-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-helix transcription factors, <i>PIF4</i> and <i>PIF5</i>, were found to be transcriptionally up-regulated in <i>cog1-3D</i>. Genetic analysis indicated that PIF4 and PIF5 were required for COG1 to promote BR biosynthesis and hypocotyl elongation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that COG1 binds to the promoter regions of <i>PIF4</i> and <i>PIF5</i>, and PIF4 and PIF5 bind to the promoter regions of key BR biosynthetic genes, such as <i>DWF4</i> and <i>BR6ox2</i>, to directly promote their expression. These results demonstrated that COG1 regulates BR biosynthesis via up-regulating the transcription of <i>PIF4</i> and <i>PIF5</i>.</p>

The REVEILLE Clock Genes Inhibit Growth of Juvenile and Adult Plants by Control of Cell Size
<p>The circadian clock is a complex regulatory network that enhances plant growth and fitness in a constantly changing environment. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the clock is composed of numerous regulatory feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>s in which <i>REVEILLE8</i> (<i>RVE8</i>) and its homologs <i>RVE4</i> and <i>RVE6</i> act in a partially redundant manner to promote clock pace. Here, we report that the remaining members of the <i>RVE8</i> clade, <i>RVE3</i> and <i>RVE5</i>, play only minor roles in the regulation of clock function. However, we find that RVE8 clade proteins have unexpected functions in the modulation of light input to the clock and the control of plant growth at multiple stages of development. In seedlings, these proteins repress hypocotyl elongation in a daylength- and sucrose-dependent manner. Strikingly, adult <i>rve4 6 8</i> and <i>rve3 4 5 6 8</i> mutants are much larger than wild-type plants, with both increased leaf area and biomass. This size phenotype is associated with a faster growth rate and larger cell size and is not simply due to a delay in the transition to flowering. Gene expression and epistasis analysis reveal that the growth phenotypes of <i>rve</i> mutants are due to the misregulation of <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i> (<i>PIF4</i>) and <i>PIF5</i> expression. Our results show that even small changes in <i>PIF</i> gene expression caused by the perturbation of clock gene function can have large effects on the growth of adult plants.</p>

ABA Suppresses Root Hair Growth via the OBP4 Transcriptional Regulator
<p>Plants modify organ growth and tune morphogenesis in response to various endogenous and environmental cues. At the cellular level, organ growth is often adjusted by alterations in cell growth, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this control remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify the DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (DOF)-type transcription regulator OBF BINDING PROTEIN4 (OBP4) as a repressor of cell growth. Ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inhibits cell growth, resulting in severe dwarfism and the repression of genes involved in the regulation of water transport, root hair development, and stress responses. Among the basic helix-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-helix transcription factors known to control root hair growth, OBP4 binds the <i>ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE6-LIKE2</i> (<i>RSL2</i>) promoter to repress its expression. The accumulation of OBP4 proteins is detected in expanding root epidermal cells, and its expression level is increased by the application of abscisic acid (ABA) at concentrations sufficient to inhibit root hair growth. ABA-dependent induction of <i>OBP4</i> is associated with the reduced expression of <i>RSL2</i>. Furthermore, ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> or loss of <i>RSL2</i> function results in ABA-insensitive root hair growth. Taken together, our results suggest that OBP4-mediated transcriptional repression of <i>RSL2</i> contributes to the ABA-dependent inhibition of root hair growth in Arabidopsis.</p>

Capping Protein Modulates Actin Remodeling in Response to Reactive Oxygen Species during Plant Innate Immunity
<p>Plants perceive microbe-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns to activate innate immune signaling events, such as bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The actin cytoskeleton remodels during the first 5 min of innate immune signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) epidermal cells; however, the immune signals that impinge on actin cytoskeleton and its response regulators remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that rapid actin remodeling upon elicitation with diverse microbe-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns represent a conserved plant immune response. Actin remodeling requires ROS generated by the defense-associated NADPH oxidase, RBOHD. Moreover, perception of flg22 by its cognate receptor complex triggers actin remodeling through the activation of RBOHD-dependent ROS production. Our genetic studies reveal that the ubiquitous heterodimeric capping protein transduces ROS signaling to the actin cytoskeleton during innate immunity. Additionally, we uncover a negative feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong> between actin remodeling and flg22-induced ROS production.</p>

Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Rice atypical HLH protein <i>Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1</i>-<i>LIKE1</i> (<i>OsBUL1</i>) is preferentially expressed in the lamina joint where it controls cell elongation and positively affects leaf angles. <i>OsBUL1</i> knockout mutant (<i>osbul1</i>) and transgenic rice for double-stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) of <i>OsBUL1</i> produced erect leaves with smaller grains, whereas <i>OsBUL1</i> overexpressors and an activation tagging line of <i>OsBUL1</i> exhibited increased lamina inclination and grain size. Moreover, <i>OsBUL1</i> expression was induced by brassinolide (BL) and <i>osbul1</i> did not respond to BL treatment. To understand the molecular network of OsBUL1 function in rice, we isolated a novel OsBUL1-interacting protein, LO9-177, an uncharacterized protein containing a KxDL motif, and functionally studied it with respect to the lamina inclination and grain size of rice. OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic helix-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the lamina joint of rice. Expression of <i>OsBC1</i> is also upregulated by BL and has a similar pattern to that of <i>OsBUL1</i>. Transgenic rice plants expressing <i>OsBC1</i> under the control of <i>OsBUL1</i> promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending, while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of <i>OsBC1</i> displayed reduced plant height and grain size. Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177, and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system, providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation.</p>

A Conserved cis-Regulatory Module Determines Germline Fate through Activation of the Transcription Factor DUO1 Promoter
<p>The development of the male germline within pollen relies upon the activation of numerous target genes by the transcription factor DUO POLLEN1 (DUO1). The expression of DUO1 is restricted to the male germline and is first detected shortly after the asymmetric division that segregates the germ cell lineage. Transcriptional regulation is critical in controlling DUO1 expression, since transcriptional and translational fusions show similar expression patterns. Here, we identify key promoter sequences required for the germline-specific regulation of <i>DUO1</i> transcription. Combining promoter deletion analyses with phylogenetic footprinting in eudicots and in Arabidopsis accessions, we identify a cis-regulatory module, <i>Regulatory region of DUO1</i> (<i>ROD1</i>), which replicates the expression pattern of <i>DUO1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We show that <i>ROD1</i> from the legume <i>Medicago truncatula</i> directs male germline-specific expression in Arabidopsis, demonstrating conservation of DUO1 regulation among eudicots. <i>ROD1</i> contains several short conserved cis-regulatory elements, including three copies of the motif DNGTGGV, required for germline expression and tandem repeats of the motif YAACYGY, which enhance <i>DUO1</i> transcription in a positive feedback <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>. We conclude that a cis-regulatory module conserved in eudicots directs the spatial and temporal expression of the transcription factor DUO1 to specify male germline fate and sperm cell differentiation.</p>

Ubiquitination-Related MdBT Scaffold Proteins Target a bHLH Transcription Factor for Iron Homeostasis
<p>Iron (Fe) homeostasis is crucial for plant growth and development. A network of basic helix-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loop</span></strong>-helix (bHLH) transcription factors positively regulates Fe uptake during iron deficiency. However, their up-regulation or overexpression leads to Fe overload and reactive oxygen species generation, thereby damaging the plants. Here, we found that two BTB/TAZ proteins, MdBT1 and MdBT2, interact with the MbHLH104 protein in apple. In addition, the function of MdBT2 was characterized as a regulator of MdbHLH104 degradation via ubiquitination and the 26S proteasome pathway, thereby controlling the activity of plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases and the acquisition of iron. Furthermore, MdBT2 interacted with MdCUL3 proteins, which were required for the MdBT2-mediated ubiquitination modification of MdbHLH104 and its degradation. In sum, our findings demonstrate that MdBT proteins interact with MdCUL3 to bridge the formation of the MdBTs<sup>MdCUL3</sup> complex, which negatively modulates the degradation of the MdbHLH104 protein in response to changes in Fe status to maintain iron homeostasis in plants.</p>

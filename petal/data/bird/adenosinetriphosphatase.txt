Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p>Cell motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and cancer cell invasion. It is generally thought that migrating cells grab and exert traction force onto the extracellular matrix in order to pull the cell body forward. While previous studies have shown that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> II deficient cells migrate efficiently, whether these cells exert traction forces during cell migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a force sensor and shRNA specific to each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA and IIB individually regulate cell migration and traction force generation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction force was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA deficient cells lost actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIB deficient cells maintained similar actin organization and focal adhesions as wild-type cells. Interestingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA deficient cells migrated faster than wild-type or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIB deficient cells on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA deficient cells exerted significantly less traction force at the leading edge than wild-type or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIB deficient cells. These results suggest that, in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> IIA mediated force-generating machinery, cells move with minimal traction forces at the cell periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of cells to adapt and migrate.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Myosins XI Are Involved in Exocytosis of Cellulose Synthase Complexes
<p>In plants, cellulose is synthesized at the cell surface by plasma membrane (PM)-localized cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that underpin delivery of CSCs to the PM, however, are poorly understood. Cortical microtubules have been shown to interact with CESA-containing compartments and mark the site for CSC delivery, but are not required for the delivery itself. Here, we demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> XI and the actin cytoskeleton mediate CSC delivery to the PM by coordinating the exocytosis of CESA-containing compartments. Measurement of cellulose content indicated that cellulose biosynthesis was significantly reduced in a <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> xik xi1 xi2</i> triple-knockout mutant. By combining genetic and pharmacological disruption of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> activity with quantitative live-cell imaging, we observed decreased abundance of PM-localized CSCs and reduced delivery rate of CSCs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>-deficient cells. These phenotypes correlated with a significant increase in failed vesicle secretion events at the PM as well as an abnormal accumulation of CESA-containing compartments at the cell cortex. Through high-resolution spatiotemporal assays of cortical vesicle behavior, we identified defects in CSC vesicle tethering and fusion at the PM. Furthermore, disruption of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> activity reduced the delivery of several other secretory markers to the PM and reduced constitutive and receptor-mediated endocytosis. These findings reveal a previously undescribed role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> in vesicle secretion and cellulose production at the cytoskeleton-PM-cell wall nexus.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
In <i>Drosophila</i>, RhoGEF2 cooperates with activated Ras in tumorigenesis through a pathway involving Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II and JNK signalling
<p>The <i>Ras</i> oncogene contributes to ∼30% of human cancers, but alone is not sufficient for tumorigenesis. In a <i>Drosophila</i> screen for oncogenes that cooperate with an activated allele of <i>Ras</i> (<i>Ras<sup>ACT</sup></i>) to promote tissue overgrowth and invasion, we identified the GTP exchange factor <i>RhoGEF2</i>, an activator of Rho-family signalling. Here, we show that RhoGEF2 also cooperates with an activated allele of a downstream effector of Ras, <i>Raf</i> (<i>Raf<sup>GOF</sup></i>). We dissect the downstream pathways through which RhoGEF2 cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> (and Raf<sup>GOF</sup>), and show that RhoGEF2 requires Rho1, but not Rac, for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, of the Rho1 effectors, we show that RhoGEF2 + Ras (Raf)-mediated tumorigenesis requires the Rho kinase (Rok)–Myosin-II pathway, but not Diaphanous, Lim kinase or protein kinase N. The Rho1–Rok–Myosin-II pathway leads to the activation of Jun kinase (JNK), in cooperation with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>. Moreover, we show that activation of Rok or Myosin II, using constitutively active transgenes, is sufficient for cooperative tumorigenesis with Ras<sup>ACT</sup>, and together with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> leads to strong activation of JNK. Our results show that Rok–Myosin-II activity is necessary and sufficient for Ras-mediated tumorigenesis. Our observation that activation of Myosin II, which regulates Filamentous actin (F-actin) contractility without affecting F-actin levels, cooperates with Ras<sup>ACT</sup> to promote JNK activation and tumorigenesis, suggests that increased cell contractility is a key factor in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we show that signalling via the Tumour necrosis factor (TNF; also known as Egr)-ligand–JNK pathway is most likely the predominant pathway that activates JNK upon Rok activation. Overall, our analysis highlights the need for further analysis of the Rok–Myosin-II pathway in cooperation with Ras in human cancers.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
The fraction of strongly bound cross-bridges is increased in mice that carry the myopathy-linked myosin heavy chain mutation MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>opathies have emerged as a new group of diseases and are caused by mutations in genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. One major hallmark of these diseases is skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of muscle fibers from <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i> mice, which carry a mutation that provokes an L342Q change within the catalytic domain of the type IIb skeletal muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> protein MYH4. Because homozygous animals develop rapid muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis, they must be killed by postnatal day 13, so all experiments were performed using skeletal muscles from adult heterozygous animals (<i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+). <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice contain MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup> expressed at 7% of the levels of the wild-type (WT) protein, and are overtly and histologically normal. However, mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized fibers revealed, upon maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, higher stiffness as well as altered meridional and equatorial reflections in <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice when compared with age-matched WT animals. Under rigor conditions, by contrast, no difference was observed between <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ and WT mice. Altogether, these findings prove that, in adult <i>MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup></i> heterozygous mice, the transition from weak to strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> cross-bridge binding is facilitated, increasing the number of strongly attached <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> heads, thus enhancing force production. These changes are predictably exacerbated in the type IIb fibers of homozygous mice, in which the embryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> isoform is fully replaced by MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>, leading to a hypercontraction, muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of skeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>opathies.</p>

PAR-2, LGL-1 and the CDC-42 GAP CHIN-1 act in distinct pathways to maintain polarity in the <i>C. elegans</i> embryo
<p>In the one-cell <i>C. elegans</i> embryo, polarity is maintained by mutual antagonism between the anterior cortical proteins PAR-3, PKC-3, PAR-6 and CDC-42, and the posterior cortical proteins PAR-2 and LGL-1 on the posterior cortex. The mechanisms by which these proteins interact to maintain polarity are incompletely understood. In this study, we investigate the interplay among PAR-2, LGL-1, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>, the anterior PAR proteins and CDC-42. We find that PAR-2 and LGL-1 affect cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> accumulation by different mechanisms. LGL-1 does not directly antagonize the accumulation of cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> and instead plays a role in regulating PAR-6 levels. By contrast, PAR-2 likely has separate roles in regulating cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> accumulation and preventing the expansion of the anterior cortical domain. We also provide evidence that asymmetry of active CDC-42 can be maintained independently of LGL-1 and PAR-2 by a redundant pathway that includes the CDC-42 GAP CHIN-1. Finally, we show that, in addition to its primary role in regulating the size of the anterior cortical domain via its binding to PAR-6, CDC-42 has a secondary role in regulating cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> that is not dependent on PAR-6.</p>

Molecular to organismal chirality is induced by the conserved myosin 1D
<p>The emergence of asymmetry from an initially symmetrical state is a universal transition in nature. Living organisms show asymmetries at the molecular, cellular, tissular, and organismal level. However, whether and how multilevel asymmetries are related remains unclear. In this study, we show that <i>Drosophila</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> 1D (Myo1D) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> 1C (Myo1C) are sufficient to generate de novo directional twisting of cells, single organs, or the whole body in opposite directions. Directionality lies in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>s’ motor domain and is swappable between Myo1D and Myo1C. In addition, Myo1D drives gliding of actin filaments in circular, counterclockwise paths in vitro. Altogether, our results reveal the molecular motor Myo1D as a chiral determinant that is sufficient to break symmetry at all biological scales through chiral interaction with the actin cytoskeleton.</p>

RSK2 contributes to myogenic vasoconstriction of resistance arteries by activating smooth muscle myosin and the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger
<p>Smooth muscle contraction is triggered when Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylates the regulatory light chain of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> (RLC<sub>20</sub>). However, blood vessels from <i>Mlck</i>-deficient mouse embryos retain the ability to contract, suggesting the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms. We showed that the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) also phosphorylated RLC<sub>20</sub> to promote smooth muscle contractility. Active, phosphorylated RSK2 was present in mouse resistance arteries under normal basal tone, and phosphorylation of RSK2 increased with myogenic vasoconstriction or agonist stimulation. Resistance arteries from <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice were dilated and showed reduced myogenic tone and RLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation. RSK2 phosphorylated Ser<sup>19</sup> in RLC in vitro. In addition, RSK2 phosphorylated an activating site in the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger (NHE-1), resulting in cytosolic alkalinization and an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> that promotes vasoconstriction. NHE-1 activity increased upon myogenic constriction, and the increase in intracellular pH was suppressed in <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice. In pressured arteries, RSK2-dependent activation of NHE-1 was associated with increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, which would be expected to increase MLCK activity, thereby contributing to basal tone and myogenic responses. Accordingly, <i>Rsk2</i>-deficient mice had lower blood pressure than normal littermates. Thus, RSK2 mediates a procontractile signaling pathway that contributes to the regulation of basal vascular tone, myogenic vasoconstriction, and blood pressure and may be a potential therapeutic target in smooth muscle contractility disorders.</p>

T-plastin is essential for basement membrane assembly and epidermal morphogenesis
<p>The establishment of epithelial architecture is a complex process involving cross-talk between cells and the basement membrane. Basement membrane assembly requires integrin activity but the role of the associated acto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> cytoskeleton is poorly understood. Here, we identify the actin-bundling protein T-plastin (Pls3) as a regulator of basement membrane assembly and epidermal morphogenesis. In utero depletion of <i>Pls3</i> transcripts in mouse embryos caused basement membrane and polarity defects in the epidermis but had little effect on cell adhesion and differentiation. Loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that the apicobasal polarity defects were secondary to the disruption of the basement membrane. However, the basement membrane itself was profoundly sensitive to subtle perturbations in the actin cytoskeleton. We further show that Pls3 localized to the cell cortex, where it was essential for the localization and activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> II. Inhibition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> II motor activity disrupted basement membrane organization.

Profiling the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force in B cell activation
<p>B lymphocytes use B cell receptors (BCRs) to recognize membrane-bound antigens to further initiate cell spreading and contraction responses during B cell activation. We combined traction force microscopy and live-cell imaging to profile the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force generation in these responses. We showed that B cell activation required the generation of 10 to 20 nN of traction force when encountering antigens presented by substrates with stiffness values from 0.5 to 1 kPa, which mimic the rigidity of antigen-presenting cells in vivo. Perturbation experiments revealed that F-actin remodeling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>- and dynein-mediated contractility contributed to traction force generation and B cell activation. Moreover, membrane-proximal BCR signaling molecules (including Lyn, Syk, Btk, PLC-γ2, BLNK, and Vav3) and adaptor molecules (Grb2, Cbl, and Dok-3) linking BCR microclusters and motor proteins were also required for the sustained generation of these traction forces. We found a positive correlation between the strength of the traction force and the mean fluorescence intensity of the BCR microclusters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that isotype-switched memory B cells expressing immunoglobulin G (IgG)–BCRs generated greater traction forces than did mature naive B cells expressing IgM-BCRs during B cell activation. Last, we observed that primary B cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis generated greater traction forces than did B cells from healthy donors in response to antigen stimulation. Together, these data delineate the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force during B cell activation.</p>

Exploring cytoskeletal diversity in neurons
<p>Often in biology, form follows function. For example, the ability of neurons to receive, process, and transmit information depends on their polarized organization into axons and dendrites. The cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins shape cells and establish spatial organization. Microtubules (MTs) and actin are core components of the cytoskeleton and are assembled through head-to-tail polymerization of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers and actin monomers, respectively, resulting in asymmetric, polarized polymers with two different ends, called plus and minus ends. The spatially regulated polymerization of MTs and actin can drive morphological transitions, such as local protrusion of the plasma membrane, to drive cell migration or the development of specialized extensions, such as axons or dendrites and their branches. In addition, the structural asymmetry of MTs and actin enables cytoskeletal motor proteins (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong>, kinesin, and dynein) to walk toward a specific end of the fibers. Given the extreme dimensions and functional compartmentalization of neurons, such active transport is critical to sort and distribute cellular cargoes. Recent studies have used advanced microscopy to reveal how the cytoskeleton takes many different forms to facilitate local functions in neurons (see the figure).</p>

A <i>LIMA1</i> variant promotes low plasma LDL cholesterol and decreases intestinal cholesterol absorption
<p>A high concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although LDL-C levels vary among humans and are heritable, the genetic factors affecting LDL-C are not fully characterized. We identified a rare frameshift variant in the <i>LIMA1</i> (also known as <i>EPLIN</i> or <i>SREBP3</i>) gene from a Chinese family of Kazakh ethnicity with inherited low LDL-C and reduced cholesterol absorption. In a mouse model, LIMA1 was mainly expressed in the small intestine and localized on the brush border membrane. LIMA1 bridged NPC1L1, an essential protein for cholesterol absorption, to a transportation complex containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> Vb and facilitated cholesterol uptake. Similar to the human phenotype, <i>Lima1</i>-deficient mice displayed reduced cholesterol absorption and were resistant to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Through our study of both mice and humans, we identify LIMA1 as a key protein regulating intestinal cholesterol absorption.</p>

Local amplifiers of IL-4Rα–mediated macrophage activation promote repair in lung and liver
<p>The type 2 immune response controls helminth infection and maintains tissue homeostasis but can lead to allergy and fibrosis if not adequately regulated. We have discovered local tissue-specific amplifiers of type 2–mediated macrophage activation. In the lung, surfactant protein A (SP-A) enhanced interleukin-4 (IL-4)–dependent macrophage proliferation and activation, accelerating parasite clearance and reducing pulmonary injury after infection with a lung-migrating helminth. In the peritoneal cavity and liver, C1q enhancement of type 2 macrophage activation was required for liver repair after bacterial infection, but resulted in fibrosis after peritoneal dialysis. IL-4 drives production of these structurally related defense collagens, SP-A and C1q, and the expression of their receptor, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> 18A. These findings reveal the existence within different tissues of an amplification system needed for local type 2 responses.</p>

The Wnt/JNK signaling target gene <i>alcam</i> is required for embryonic kidney development
<p>Proper development of nephrons is essential for kidney function. β-Catenin-independent Wnt signaling through Fzd8, Inversin, Daam1, RhoA and Myosin is required for nephric tubule morphogenesis. Here, we provide a novel mechanism through which non-canonical Wnt signaling contributes to tubular development. Using <i>Xenopus laevis</i> as a model system, we found that the cell-adhesion molecule Alcam is required for proper nephrogenesis and functions downstream of Fzd3 during embryonic kidney development. We found <i>alcam</i> expression to be independent of Fzd8 or Inversin, but to be transcriptionally regulated by the β-Catenin-independent Wnt/JNK pathway involving ATF2 and Pax2 in a direct manner. These novel findings indicate that several branches of Wnt signaling are independently required for proximal tubule development. Moreover, our data indicate that regulation of morphogenesis by non-canonical Wnt ligands also involves direct transcriptional responses in addition to the effects on a post-translational level.</p>

Discriminatory power for AMI, as quantified by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), was comparable for cMyC (AUC, 0.924), hs-cTnT (AUC, 0.927), and hs-cTnI (AUC, 0.922) and superior to cTnI measured by a contemporary sensitivity assay (AUC, 0.909). The combination of cMyC with hs-cTnT or standard-sensitivity cTnI (but not hs-cTnI) led to an increase in AUC to 0.931 (<i>P</i><0.0001) and 0.926 (<i>P</i>=0.003), respectively. Use of cMyC more accurately classified patients with a single blood test into rule-out or rule-in categories: Net Reclassification Improvement +0.149 versus hs-cTnT, +0.235 versus hs-cTnI (<i>P</i><0.001). In early presenters (chest pain <3 h), the improvement in rule-in/rule-out classification with cMyC was larger compared with hs-cTnT (Net Reclassification Improvement +0.256) and hs-cTnI (Net Reclassification Improvement +0.308; both <i>P</i><0.001). Comparing the C statistics, cMyC was superior to hs-cTnI and standard sensitivity cTnI (<i>P</i><0.05 for both) and similar to hs-cTnT at predicting death at 3 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>cMyC at presentation provides discriminatory power comparable to hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in the diagnosis of AMI and may perform favorably in patients presenting early after symptom onset.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Dynamic microtubules drive fibroblast spreading
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Cell spreading is a non-linear process. The fast spreading phase depends on dynamic microtubules (MTs). Rapid growth of MTs towards the cell membrane promotes the temporal relaxation of acto-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myosin</span></strong> contractility.</p>

The Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Patients at Risk of Infective Endocarditis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended stopping antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for those at risk of infective endocarditis (IE) undergoing dental procedures in the United Kingdom, citing a lack of evidence of efficacy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness. We have performed a new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">economi</span></strong>c evaluation of AP on the basis of contemporary estimates of efficacy, adverse events, and resource implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A decision analytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness model was used. Health service <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s and benefits (measured as quality-adjusted life-years) were estimated. Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to estimate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>AP was less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>ly and more effective than no AP for all patients at risk of IE. The results are sensitive to AP efficacy, but efficacy would have to be substantially lower for AP not to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective. AP was even more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective in patients at high risk of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk and 33 cases in all at-risk patients) would be required for AP to be considered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> savings of £5.5 to £8.2 million ($7.3–$10.9 million) and health gains >2600 quality-adjusted life-years could be achieved from reinstating AP in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>AP is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective for preventing IE, particularly in those at high risk.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Cost effectiveness of patellofemoral <i>versus</i> total knee arthroplasty in younger patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) has experienced significant   improvements in implant survivorship with second generation designs.   This has renewed interest in PFA as an alternative to total knee   arthroplasty (TKA) for younger active patients with isolated patellofemoral   osteoarthritis (PF OA). We analysed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness of PFA <i>versus</i> TKA   for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of isolated PF OA in the United States-based   population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used a Markov transition state model to compare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness   between PFA and TKA.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in plants could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most plants, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) plants overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects plant N use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency. The modified plants were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type plants. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing plants displayed improved N uptake or utilization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control plants. Together, these data support that engineering N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop plants with improved productivity as well as N use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in a range of N environments.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of summer droughts in the northeastern deciduous forest of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">economi</span></strong>cally important native tree species, to soil water deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of biomass, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate soil water deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under soil water deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under water deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency) decreased under soil water deficit due to shifts in biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under water deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of root biomass to enhance its water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement.</p>

Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll conductance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>encies. To improve water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, mesophyll conductance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll conductance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that mesophyll conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll conductance is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between mesophyll conductance and water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll conductance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll conductance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal conductance.</p>

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statins are effective in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Sensitivity analyses varied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness ratios and numbers needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 108.

Interplay of growth rate and xylem plasticity for optimal coordination of carbon and hydraulic economies in <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> trees
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent leaf water supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and tree growth. Renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing carbon investment while growing taller, and any deficiency of carbon availability may result in increasing hydraulic constraints to water flow. Therefore, plants need to coordinate carbon assimilation and biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to guarantee an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent and safe long-distance transport system. We tested the hypothesis that reduced branch elongation rates together with carbon-saving adjustments of xylem anatomy hydraulically compensate for the reduction in biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to xylem. We measured leaf biomass, hydraulic and anatomical properties of wood segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing (SG) and 10 fast growing (FG) <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> L. trees. Branches of SG trees had five times slower branch elongation rate (7 vs 35  cm year<sup>–1</sup>), and produced a higher leaf biomass (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). On the contrary, we found no differences between SG and FG trees in terms of leaf-specific conductivity (<i>P</i> > 0.05) and xylem safety (Ψ<sub>50</sub> ≈ −3.2  MPa). Slower elongation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s associated with growth, while maintaining similar leaf-specific conductivity and xylem safety.</p>

Carrier lifetimes of >1 μs in Sn-Pb perovskites enable efficient all-perovskite tandem solar cells
<p>All-perovskite–based polycrystalline thin-film tandem solar cells have the potential to deliver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>encies of >30%. However, the performance of all-perovskite–based tandem devices has been limited by the lack of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, low–band gap tin-lead (Sn-Pb) mixed-perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We found that the addition of guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) resulted in marked improvements in the structural and optoelectronic properties of Sn-Pb mixed, low–band gap (~1.25 electron volt) perovskite films. The films have defect densities that are lower by a factor of 10, leading to carrier lifetimes of greater than 1 microsecond and diffusion lengths of 2.5 micrometers.

Sensitivity to “sunk costs” in mice, rats, and humans
<p>Sunk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s are irrecoverable investments that should not influence decisions, because decisions should be made on the basis of expected future consequences. Both human and nonhuman animals can show sensitivity to sunk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s, but reports from across species are inconsistent. In a temporal context, a sensitivity to sunk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s arises when an individual resists ending an activity, even if it seems unproductive, because of the time already invested. In two parallel foraging tasks that we designed, we found that mice, rats, and humans show similar sensitivities to sunk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s in their decision-making. Unexpectedly, sensitivity to time invested accrued only after an initial decision had been made. These findings suggest that sensitivity to temporal sunk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s lies in a vulnerability distinct from deliberation processes and that this distinction is present across species.</p>

Giant nonlinear response at a plasmonic nanofocus drives efficient four-wave mixing
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent optical frequency mixing typically must accumulate over large interaction lengths because nonlinear responses in natural materials are inherently weak. This limits the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of mixing processes owing to the requirement of phase matching. Here, we report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent four-wave mixing (FWM) over micrometer-scale interaction lengths at telecommunications wavelengths on silicon. We used an integrated plasmonic gap waveguide that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer. The gap waveguide intensifies light by nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometers, thus generating a nonlinear response so strong that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent FWM accumulates over wavelength-scale distances. This technique opens up nonlinear optics to a regime of relaxed phase matching, with the possibility of compact, broadband, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent frequency mixing integrated with silicon photonics.</p>

Perovskite-perovskite tandem photovoltaics with optimized band gaps
<p>We demonstrate four- and two-terminal perovskite-perovskite tandem solar cells with ideally matched band gaps. We develop an infrared-absorbing 1.2–electron volt band-gap perovskite, FA<sub>0.75</sub>Cs<sub>0.25</sub>Sn<sub>0.5</sub>Pb<sub>0.5</sub>I<sub>3</sub>, that can deliver 14.8% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency. By combining this material with a wider–band gap FA<sub>0.83</sub>Cs<sub>0.17</sub>Pb(I<sub>0.5</sub>Br<sub>0.5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> material, we achieve monolithic two-terminal tandem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>encies of 17.0% with >1.65-volt open-circuit voltage. We also make mechanically stacked four-terminal tandem cells and obtain 20.3% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency. Notably, we find  that our infrared-absorbing perovskite cells exhibit excellent thermal and atmospheric stability, not previously achieved for Sn-based perovskites. This device architecture and materials set will enable “all-perovskite” thin-film solar cells to reach the highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>encies in the long term at the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle contraction increases propulsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture size, which reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

Free-swimming northern elephant seals have low field metabolic rates that are sensitive to an increased cost of transport
<p>Widely ranging marine predators often adopt stereotyped, energy-saving behaviours to minimize the energetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of transport while maximizing energy gain. Environmental and anthropogenic disturbances can disrupt energy balance by prompting avoidance behaviours that increase transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s, thereby decreasing foraging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency. We examined the ability of 12 free-ranging, juvenile northern elephant seals (<i>Mirounga angustirostris</i>) to mitigate the effects of experimentally increased transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s by modifying their behaviour and/or energy use in a compensatory manner. Under normal locomotion, elephant seals had low energy requirements (106.5±28.2 kJ kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>), approaching or even falling below predictions of basal requirements. Seals responded to a small increase in locomotion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s by spending more time resting between dives (149±44 s) compared with matched control treatments (102±11 s; <i>P</i><0.01). Despite incurred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s, most other dive and transit behaviours were conserved across treatments, including fixed, rhythmic swimming gaits. Because of this, and because each flipper stroke had a predictable effect on total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s (<i>P</i><0.001), total energy expenditure was strongly correlated with time spent at sea under both treatments (<i>P</i><0.0001). These results suggest that transiting elephant seals have a limited capacity to modify their locomotory behaviour without increasing their transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s. Based on this, we conclude that elephant seals and other ocean predators occupying similar niches may be particularly sensitive to increased transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s incurred when avoiding unanticipated disturbances.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In addition, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour.</p>

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely based on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of diagnosis of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (hazard ratio amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard ratio death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-intensity statins with lower amputation and death risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-intensity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-based study to show that high-intensity statin use at the time of PAD diagnosis is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and mortality in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with low-to-moderate–intensity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as well.</p></sec>

Atrial Fibrillation and Ventricular Arrhythmias
<p>Sex-specific differences in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, clinical treatment, and clinical outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF), sustained ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death are recognized. Sex hormones cause differences in cardiac electrophysiological parameters between men and women that may affect the risk for arrhythmias. The incidence and prevalence of AF is lower in women than in men. However, because women live longer and AF prevalence increases with age, the absolute number of women with AF exceeds that of men. Women with AF are more symptomatic, present with more atypical symptoms, and report worse quality of life in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with men. Female sex is an independent risk factor for death or stroke attributable to AF. Oral anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention has similar efficacy for men and women, but older women treated with warfarin have a higher residual risk of stroke in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with men. Women with AF are less likely to receive rhythm control antiarrhythmic drug therapy, electric cardioversion, or catheter ablation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with men.

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to both reproductive and vegetative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in fruiting and non-fruiting trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of reproduction on C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to vegetative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting trees, fruiting reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting trees than non-fruiting trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Tantalum-doped tungsten oxide (Ta-WO<i><sub>x</sub></i>)/conjugated polymer multilayers offer a surprisingly small interface barrier and form quasi-ohmic contacts universally with various scalable conjugated polymers. In a simple device with regular planar architecture and a self-assembled monolayer, Ta-WO<i><sub>x</sub></i>–doped interface–based perovskite solar cells achieve maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>encies of 21.2% and offer more than 1000 hours of light stability. By eliminating additional ionic dopants, these findings open up the entire class of organics as scalable hole-transporting materials for perovskite solar cells.</p>

The long-run poverty and gender impacts of mobile money
<p>Mobile money, a service that allows monetary value to be stored on a mobile phone and sent to other users via text messages, has been adopted by the vast majority of Kenyan households. We estimate that access to the Kenyan mobile money system M-PESA increased per capita consumption levels and lifted 194,000 households, or 2% of Kenyan households, out of poverty. The impacts, which are more pronounced for female-headed households, appear to be driven by changes in financial behavior—in particular, increased financial resilience and saving—and labor market outcomes, such as occupational choice, especially for women, who moved out of agriculture and into business. Mobile money has therefore increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of consumption over time while allowing a more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of labor, resulting in a meaningful reduction of poverty in Kenya.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major mineral types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these minerals and the control that the leaf exerts over mineral deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the mineral locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the minerals, and mineral volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D mineral distribution that is preserved in different environments. The mineral distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
High Fitness Costs and Instability of Gene Duplications Reduce Rates of Evolution of New Genes by Duplication-Divergence Mechanisms
<p>An important mechanism for generation of new genes is by duplication-divergence of existing genes. Duplication-divergence includes several different submodels, such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of neutral mutations the original function is distributed between two partially functional and complementary genes, and neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the fitness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> and genetic stability of the duplications. Here, we determined the fitness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> and stability of defined gene duplications/amplifications on a low copy number plasmid. Our experimental results show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each additional kilo base pairs of DNA reduces fitness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene amplifications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the fitness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s and instability strongly reduces the likelihood of both sub- and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial functions.</p>

Clinical Outcomes and Cost-Effectiveness of Fractional Flow Reserve–Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies found that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not improve outcome compared with medical therapy (MT) in patients with stable coronary artery disease, but PCI was guided by angiography alone.

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement were captured and used to generate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255).

An Efficient System for <i>Ds</i> Transposon Tagging in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Transposon tagging is a powerful tool that has been widely applied in several species for insertional mutagenesis in plants. Several efforts have aimed to create transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutant populations in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot plant used as a model system to study temperate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at using transposon strategies. Here, we describe the application of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociation</i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging system in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> element were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> plants. The <i>Ds</i> element was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the function of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, and segregation, the <i>Ds</i> element separated from the <i>Ac</i> element. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only plants using G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> lines, some of which were highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only plants. Furthermore, we identified a large collection of mutants with visible developmental phenotypes via this transposon tagging system. The system is relatively simple and rapid in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> to traditional T-DNA insertion strategies, because once <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency lines are obtained they can be reused to generate more lines from nontransposed plants without the use of time-consuming tissue culture steps.</p>

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring seed oils to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low seed oil content and poor seedling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced abundant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of seed HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more abundant than any other fatty acid in these seeds, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in seeds following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent utilization of hydroxy-containing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-oil phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage lipid available for mobilization during seedling development, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in seedling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified oils in plants.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a dispersed downward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ently identify insertion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-genome sequencing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

Current mapping tools are often not user friendly, are complicated, or require extensive preparation steps. To simplify the process of mapping new mutations, we developed a pipeline that takes next-generation sequencing fastq files as input, calls on several well-established and freely available genome-analysis tools, and outputs the most likely causal DNA changes. The pipeline has been validated in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (Arabidopsis) and can be readily applied to other species, with the possibility of mapping either dominant or recessive mutations.</p>

Optimization of Light-Harvesting Pigment Improves Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>Maximizing light capture by light-harvesting pigment optimization represents an attractive but challenging strategy to improve photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency. Here, we report that loss of a previously uncharacterized gene, <i>HIGH PHOTOSYNTHETIC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ENCY1</i> (<i>HPE1</i>), optimizes light-harvesting pigments, leading to improved photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency and biomass production. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>hpe1</i> mutants show faster electron transport and increased contents of carbohydrates. <i>HPE1</i> encodes a chloroplast protein containing an RNA recognition motif that directly associates with and regulates the splicing of target RNAs of plastid genes. HPE1 also interacts with other plastid RNA-splicing factors, including CAF1 and OTP51, which share common targets with HPE1. Deficiency of HPE1 alters the expression of nucleus-encoded chlorophyll-related genes, probably through plastid-to-nucleus signaling, causing decreased total content of chlorophyll (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>) in a limited range but increased chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> ratio. Interestingly, this adjustment of light-harvesting pigment reduces antenna size, improves light capture, decreases energy loss, mitigates photodamage, and enhances photosynthetic quantum yield during photosynthesis. Our findings suggest a novel strategy to optimize light-harvesting pigments that improves photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency and biomass production in higher plants.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016).

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify any progression between   benign osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD), OFD-like adamantinoma and malignant   adamantinoma, and to investigate the rates of local recurrence,   metastases and survival, in order to develop treatment algorithms   for each.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single institution retrospective review of all patients presenting   with OFD, OFD-like adamantinoma and adamantinoma between 1973 and   2012 was undertaken. Complete data were available for 73 patients   (42 with OFD; ten with an OFD-like adamantinoma and 21 with an adamantinoma).   The mean follow-up was 10.3 years (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 years (3.0   to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 years (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at diagnosis for OFD was 13.5 years (1 to 49), 10.5   years (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 years (14 to 86) for adamantinoma.   A total of 24 of the 42 patients with OFD (57%) have not required   any treatment and have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with observation. A total of   18 of the 42 patients with OFD underwent surgery, 13 with curettage   and five with resection. In all, three patients developed recurrence   following curettage (23%) but none following resection. All these   patients were cured with further limited surgery. A total of six   patients initially diagnosed with OFD were subsequently found to   have OFD-like adamantinoma. Of the ten patients initially diagnosed   with OFD-like adamantinoma, three (30%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with observation   alone and seven underwent surgery, two with curettage and five with   resection. Local recurrence arose in two patients, one each after   curettage and resection. No patients with either OFD or an OFD-like   adamantinoma developed metastases or had progression to adamantinoma.   All patients with an adamantinoma were treated by surgery, three   with curettage, six with amputation and 12 with excision. In all,   two of the three treated with curettage developed local recurrence, requiring   further surgery. Late development of both local recurrence and metastases   led to a ten year disease specific survival of 93% which had dropped   to 39% by 20 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found no evidence of progression from OFD to adamantinoma.   Conservative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement with observation or curettage is often successful   for patients with OFD and OFD-like adamantinoma. Resection with   clear margins is required for patients with adamantinoma. Late tumour   recurrence is not uncommon in adamantinoma and prolonged follow-up   should be considered.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:409–16.</p></sec>

Do higher-volume hospitals provide better value in revision hip and knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study is to determine if higher volume hospitals   have lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s in revision hip and knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We questioned the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services   (CMS) Inpatient Charge Data and identified 789 hospitals performing   a total of 29 580 revision arthroplasties in 2014. Centres were   dichotomised into high-volume (performing over 50 revision cases   per year) and low-volume. Mean total hospital-specific charges and   inpatient payments were obtained from the database and stratified   based on Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) codes. Patient satisfaction   scores were obtained from the multiyear CMS Hospital Compare database.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>High-volume hospitals comprised 178 (30%) of the total but performed   15 068 (51%) of all revision cases, including 509 of 522 (98%) of   the most complex DRG 466 cases. While high-volume hospitals had   higher Medicare inpatient payments for DRG 467 ($21 458 <i>versus</i> $20 632,   p = 0.038) and DRG 468 ($17 003 <i>versus</i> $16 120,   p = 0.011), there was no difference in hospital specific charges   between the groups. Higher-volume facilities had a better CMS hospital   star rating (3.63 <i>versus</i> 3.35, p < 0.001). When   controlling for hospital geographic and demographic factors, high-volume   revision hospitals are less likely to be in the upper quartile of   inpatient Medicare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s for DRG 467 (odds ratio (OR) 0.593, 95%   confidence intervals (CI) 0.374 to 0.941, p = 0.026) and DRG 468   (OR 0.451, 95% CI 0.297 to 0.687, p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While a high-volume hospital is less likely to be a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>   outlier, the higher mean Medicare reimbursements at these facilities   may be due to increased case complexity.

Cemented total hip arthroplasty following acetabular fracture
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the outcomes of cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA)   following a fracture of the acetabulum, with evaluation of risk   factors and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with a patient group with no history of fracture. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 1992 and 2016, 49 patients (33 male) with mean age of   57 years (25 to 87) underwent cemented THA at a mean of 6.5 years   (0.1 to 25) following acetabular fracture. A total of 38 had undergone   surgical fixation and 11 had been treated non-operatively; 13 patients   died at a mean of 10.2 years after THA (0.6 to 19). Patients were   assessed pre-operatively, at one year and at final follow-up (mean   9.1 years, 0.5 to 23) using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS). Implant   survivorship was assessed. An age and gender-matched cohort of THAs   performed for non-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) or avascular necrosis   (AVN) (n = 98) were used to compare complications and patient-reported outcome   measures (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean time from fracture to THA was significantly shorter   for patients with AVN    (2.2 years) or protrusio (2.2 years) than those with post-traumatic   OA (9.4 years) or infection (8.0 years) (p = 0.03). Nine contained   and four uncontained defects were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with autograft (n = 11),   bulk allograft (n = 1), or trabecular metal augment (n = 1). Initial   fracture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement (open reduction and internal fixation or non-operative),   timing of THA    (>/< one year), and age (>/< 55 years) had no significant   effect on OHS or ten-year survival. Six THAs were revised at mean   of 12 years (5 to 23) with ten-year all-cause survival of 92% (95%   confidence interval 80.8 to 100). THA complication rates (all complications,   heterotopic ossification, leg length discrepancy > 10 mm) were significantly higher   following acetabular fracture compared with atraumatic OA/AVN and   OHSs were inferior: one-year OHS    (35.7 v<i>ersus</i> 40.2, p = 0.026); and final follow-up   OHS (33.6 v<i>ersus</i> 40.9, p = 0.008). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Cemented THA is a reasonable option for the sequelae of acetabular   fracture.

Proximal femoral resection without post-operative traction for the painful dislocated hip in young patients with cerebral palsy
<p>Proximal femoral resection (PFR) is a proven   pain-relieving procedure for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of patients with severe cerebral   palsy and a painful displaced hip. Previous authors have recommended   post-operative traction or immobilisation to prevent a recurrence   of pain due to proximal migration of the femoral stump. We present   a series of 79 PFRs in 63 patients, age 14.7 years (10 to 26; 35   male, 28 female), none of whom had post-operative traction or immobilisation.</p><p>A total of 71 hips (89.6%) were reported to be pain free or to   have mild pain following surgery. Four children underwent further   resection for persistent pain; of these, three had successful resolution   of pain and one had no benefit. A total of 16 hips (20.2%) showed   radiographic evidence of heterotopic ossification, all of which   had formed within one year of surgery. Four patients had a wound   infection, one of which needed debridement; all recovered fully.   A total of 59 patients (94%) reported improvements in seating and   hygiene.</p><p>The results are as good as or better than the historical results   of using traction or immobilisation. We recommend that following   PFR, children can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed without traction or immobilisation,   and can be discharged earlier and with fewer complications. However,   care should be taken with severely dystonic patients, in whom more   extensive femoral resection should be considered in combination   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of the increased tone.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:701–6.</p>

Fractures of the femoral shaft in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of closed   isolated fractures of the femoral shaft in children, and to compare   the treatment and length of stay (LOS) between major trauma centres   (MTCs) and trauma units (TUs) in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>National data were obtained from the Trauma and Audit Research   Network for all isolated, closed fractures of the femoral shaft   in children from birth to 15 years of age, between 2012 and 2015.   Age, gender, the season in which the fracture occurred, non-accidental   injury, the mechanism of injury, hospital trauma status, LOS and   type of treatment were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1852 fractures were identified. The mean annual incidence   was 5.82 per 100 000 children (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.20   to 6.44). The age of peak incidence was two years for both boys   and girls; this decreased with increasing age. Children aged four   to six years treated in MTCs were more likely to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with   open reduction and internal fixation compared with those treated   in TUs (odds ratio 3.20; 95% CI 1.12 to 9.14; p = 0.03). The median LOS   was significantly less in MTCs than in TUs for children aged between   18 months and three years treated in both a spica (p = 0.005) and   traction (p = 0.0004). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study highlights the current national trends in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement   of closed isolated fractures of the femoral shaft in children following   activation of major trauma networks in 2012.

Genetics, Lifestyle, and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in Young and Apparently Healthy Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerosis starts in childhood but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a causal risk factor, is mostly studied and dealt with when clinical events have occurred. Women are usually affected later in life than men and are underdiagnosed, undertreated, and understudied in cardiovascular trials and research. This study aims at a better understanding of lifestyle and genetic factors that affect LDL-C in young women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We randomly selected for every year of age 8 women with LDL-C ≤1st percentile (≤50 mg/dL) and 8 women with LDL-C ≥99th percentile (≥186 mg/dL) from 28 000 female participants aged between 25 to 40 years of a population-based cohort study. The resulting groups include 119 and 121 women, respectively, of an average 33 years of age. A gene-sequencing panel was used to assess established monogenic and polygenic origins of these phenotypes. Information on lifestyle was extracted from questionnaires. A healthy lifestyle score was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alloc</span></strong>ated based on a recently developed algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the women with LDL-C ≤1st percentile, 19 (15.7%) carried mutations that are causing monogenic hypocholesterolemia and 60 (49.6%) were genetically predisposed to low LDL-C on the basis of an extremely low weighted genetic risk score. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with control groups, a healthier lifestyle was not associated with low LDL-C in women without genetic predispositions. Among women with LDL-C ≥99th percentile, 20 women (16.8%) carried mutations that cause familial hypercholesterolemia, whereas 25 (21%) were predisposed to high LDL-C on the basis of a high-weighted genetic risk score. The women in whom no genetic origin for hypercholesterolemia could be identified were found to exhibit a significantly unfavorable lifestyle in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study highlights the need for early assessment of the cardiovascular risk profile in apparently healthy young women to identify those with LDL-C ≥99th percentile for their age: first, because, in this study, 17% of the cases were molecularly diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia, which needs further attention; second, because our data indicate that an unfavorable lifestyle is significantly associated with severe hypercholesterolemia in genetically unaffected women, which may also need further attention.</p></sec>

Diagnostic Accuracy of the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score Plus D-Dimer for Acute Aortic Syndromes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are rare and severe cardiovascular emergencies with unspecific symptoms. For AASs, both misdiagnosis and overtesting are key concerns, and standardized diagnostic strategies may help physicians to balance these risks. D-dimer (DD) is highly sensitive for AAS but is inadequate as a stand-alone test. Integration of pretest probability assessment with DD testing is feasible, but the safety and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of such a diagnostic strategy are currently unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter prospective observational study involving 6 hospitals in 4 countries from 2014 to 2016, consecutive outpatients were eligible if they had ≥1 of the following: chest/abdominal/back pain, syncope, perfusion deficit, and if AAS was in the differential diagnosis. The tool for pretest probability assessment was the aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS, 0–3) per current guidelines. DD was considered negative (DD−) if <500 ng/mL. Final case adjudication was based on conclusive diagnostic imaging, autopsy, surgery, or 14-day follow-up. Outcomes were the failure rate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of a diagnostic strategy for ruling out AAS in patients with ADD-RS=0/DD− or ADD-RS ≤1/DD−.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1850 patients were analyzed. Of these, 438 patients (24%) had ADD-RS=0, 1071 patients (58%) had ADD-RS=1, and 341 patients (18%) had ADD-RS >1. Two hundred forty-one patients (13%) had AAS: 125 had type A aortic dissection, 53 had type B aortic dissection, 35 had intramural aortic hematoma, 18 had aortic rupture, and 10 had penetrating aortic ulcer. A positive DD test result had an overall sensitivity of 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.6–98.6) and a specificity of 64% (95% CI, 61.6–66.4) for the diagnosis of AAS; 8 patients with AAS had DD−. In 294 patients with ADD-RS=0/DD−, 1 case of AAS was observed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1.9) and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of 15.9% (95% CI, 14.3–17.6) for the ADD-RS=0/DD− strategy. In 924 patients with ADD-RS ≤1/DD−, 3 cases of AAS were observed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1) and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of 49.9% (95% CI, 47.7–52.2) for the ADD-RS ≤1/DD− strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Integration of ADD-RS (either ADD-RS=0 or ADD-RS ≤1) with DD may be considered to standardize diagnostic rule out of AAS.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Nicotinamide Riboside Preserves Cardiac Function in a Mouse Model of Dilated Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial metabolic impairment is a major feature in chronic heart failure. As the major coenzyme in fuel oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and a substrate for enzymes signaling energy stress and oxidative stress response, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is emerging as a metabolic target in a number of diseases including heart failure. Little is known on the mechanisms regulating homeostasis of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the failing heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To explore possible alterations of NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in the failing heart, we quantified the expression of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes in the human failing heart and in the heart of a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) triggered by Serum Response Factor transcription factor depletion in the heart (SRF<sup>HKO</sup>) or of cardiac hypertrophy triggered by transverse aorta constriction. We studied the impact of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor supplementation on cardiac function in both mouse models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed a 30% loss in levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the murine failing heart of both DCM and transverse aorta constriction mice that was accompanied by a decrease in expression of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme that recycles the nicotinamide precursor, whereas the nicotinamide riboside kinase 2 (NMRK2) that phosphorylates the nicotinamide riboside precursor is increased, to a higher level in the DCM (40-fold) than in transverse aorta constriction (4-fold). This shift was also observed in human failing heart biopsies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">comparison</span></strong> with nonfailing controls. We show that the <i>Nmrk2</i> gene is an AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α responsive gene that is activated by energy stress and NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Nicotinamide riboside <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ently rescues NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis in response to FK866-mediated inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and stimulates glycolysis in cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, we show that nicotinamide riboside supplementation in food attenuates the development of heart failure in mice, more robustly in DCM, and partially after transverse aorta constriction, by stabilizing myocardial NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the failing heart. Nicotinamide riboside treatment also robustly increases the myocardial levels of 3 metabolites, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, methylnicotinamide, and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, that can be used as validation biomarkers for the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data show that nicotinamide riboside, the most energy-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent among NAD precursors, could be useful for treatment of heart failure, notably in the context of DCM, a disease with few therapeutic options.</p></sec>

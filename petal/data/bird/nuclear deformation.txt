Extraordinary plasticity of an inorganic semiconductor in darkness
<p>Inorganic semiconductors generally tend to fail in a brittle manner. Here, we report that extraordinary “plasticity” can take place in an inorganic semiconductor if the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation is carried out “in complete darkness.” Room-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation tests of zinc sulfide (ZnS) were performed under varying light conditions. ZnS crystals immediately fractured when they <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed under light irradiation. In contrast, it was found that ZnS crystals can be plastically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed up to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation strain of ε<sub>t</sub> = 45% in complete darkness. In addition, the optical bandgap of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed ZnS crystals was distinctly decreased after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation. These results suggest that dislocations in ZnS become mobile in complete darkness and that multiplied dislocations can affect the optical bandgap over the whole crystal. Inorganic semiconductors are not necessarily intrinsically brittle.</p>

Computer hexapod-assisted orthopaedic surgery provides a predictable and safe method of femoral deformity correction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Computer hexapod assisted orthopaedic surgery (CHAOS), is a method   to achieve the intra-operative correction of long bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ities   using a hexapod external fixator before definitive internal fixation   with minimally invasive stabilisation techniques.</p><p>The aims of this study were to determine the reliability of this   method in a consecutive case series of patients undergoing femoral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ity correction, with a minimum six-month follow-up, to assess   the complications and to define the ideal group of patients for   whom this treatment is appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The medical records and radiographs of all patients who underwent   CHAOS for femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ity at our institution between 2005 and   2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Records were available for all   55 consecutive procedures undertaken in 49 patients with a mean   age of 35.6 years (10.9 to 75.3) at the time of surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients were assessed at a mean interval of 44 months (6 to   90) following surgery. The indications were broad; the most common   were vitamin D resistant rickets (n = 10), growth plate arrest (n   = 6) and post-traumatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ity (n = 20).</p><p>Multi-planar correction was required in 33 cases. A single level   osteotomy was performed in 43 cases. Locking plates were used to   stabilise the osteotomy in 33 cases and intramedullary nails in   the remainder. Complications included two nonunions, one death,   one below-knee deep vein thrombosis, one deep infection and one   revision procedure due to initial under-correction. There were no   neurovascular injuries or incidence of compartment syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the largest reported series of femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ity corrections   using the CHAOS technique. This series demonstrates that precise   intra-operative realignment is possible with a hexapod external   fixator prior to definitive stabilisation with contemporary internal   fixation. This combination allows reproducible correction of complex femoral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ity from a wide variety of diagnoses and age range with a   low complication rate.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:283–8.</p></sec>

Inflation-predictable behavior and co-eruption deformation at Axial Seamount
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation of the ground surface at active volcanoes provides information about magma movements at depth. Improved seafloor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation measurements between 2011 and 2015 documented a fourfold increase in magma supply and confirmed that Axial Seamount’s eruptive behavior is inflation-predictable, probably triggered by a critical level of magmatic pressure. A 2015 eruption was successfully forecast on the basis of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation pattern and marked the first time that deflation and tilt were captured in real time by a new seafloor cabled observatory, revealing the timing, location, and volume of eruption-related magma movements. Improved modeling of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation suggests a steeply dipping prolate-spheroid pressure source beneath the eastern caldera that is consistent with the location of the zone of highest melt within the subcaldera magma reservoir determined from multichannel seismic results.</p>

Enhanced thermal stability of nanograined metals below a critical grain size
<p>The limitation of nanograined materials is their strong tendency to coarsen at elevated temperatures. As grain size decreases into the nanoscale, grain coarsening occurs at much lower temperatures, as low as ambient temperatures for some metals. We discovered that nanometer-sized grains in pure copper and nickel produced from plastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation at low temperatures exhibit notable thermal stability below a critical grain size. The instability temperature rises substantially at smaller grain sizes, and the nanograins remain stable even above the recrystallization temperatures of coarse grains. The inherent thermal stability of nanograins originates from an autonomous grain boundary evolution to low-energy states due to activation of partial dislocations in plastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation.</p>

Ultralarge elastic deformation of nanoscale diamond
<p>Diamonds have substantial hardness and durability, but attempting to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong> diamonds usually results in brittle fracture. We demonstrate ultralarge, fully reversible elastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation of nanoscale (~300 nanometers) single-crystalline and polycrystalline diamond needles. For single-crystalline diamond, the maximum tensile strains (up to 9%) approached the theoretical elastic limit, and the corresponding maximum tensile stress reached ~89 to 98 gigapascals. After combining systematic computational simulations and characterization of pre- and post<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation structural features, we ascribe the concurrent high strength and large elastic strain to the paucity of defects in the small-volume diamond nanoneedles and to the relatively smooth surfaces compared with those of microscale and larger specimens. The discovery offers the potential for new applications through optimized design of diamond nanostructure, geometry, elastic strains, and physical properties.</p>

Capillarity-induced folds fuel extreme shape changes in thin wicked membranes
<p>Soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>able materials are needed for applications such as stretchable electronics, smart textiles, or soft biomedical devices. However, the design of a durable, cost-effective, or biologically compatible version of such a material remains challenging. Living animal cells routinely cope with extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ations by unfolding preformed membrane reservoirs available in the form of microvilli or membrane folds. We synthetically mimicked this behavior by creating nanofibrous liquid-infused tissues that spontaneously form similar reservoirs through capillarity-induced folding. By understanding the physics of membrane buckling within the liquid film, we developed proof-of-concept conformable chemical surface treatments and stretchable basic electronic circuits.</p>

High dislocation density–induced large ductility in deformed and partitioned steels
<p>A wide variety of industrial applications require materials with high strength and ductility. Unfortunately, the strategies for increasing material strength, such as processing to create line defects (dislocations), tend to decrease ductility. We developed a strategy to circumvent this in inexpensive, medium manganese steel. Cold rolling followed by low-temperature tempering developed steel with metastable austenite grains embedded in a highly dislocated martensite matrix. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed and partitioned (D and P) process produced dislocation hardening but retained high ductility, both through the glide of intensive mobile dislocations and by allowing us to control martensitic transformation. The D and P strategy should apply to any other alloy with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation-induced martensitic transformation and provides a pathway for the development of high-strength, high-ductility materials.</p>

Seasonal water storage, stress modulation, and California seismicity
<p>Establishing what controls the timing of earthquakes is fundamental to understanding the nature of the earthquake cycle and critical to determining time-dependent earthquake hazard. Seasonal loading provides a natural laboratory to explore the crustal response to a quantifiable transient force. In California, water storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>s the crust as snow and water accumulates during the wet winter months. We used 9 years of global positioning system (GPS) vertical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation time series to constrain models of monthly hydrospheric loading and the resulting stress changes on fault planes of small earthquakes. The seasonal loading analysis reveals earthquakes occurring more frequently during stress conditions that favor earthquake rupture. We infer that California seismicity rates are modestly modulated by natural hydrological loading cycles.</p>

Global drainage patterns and the origins of topographic relief on Earth, Mars, and Titan
<p>Rivers have eroded the topography of Mars, Titan, and Earth, creating diverse landscapes. However, the dominant processes that generated topography on Titan (and to some extent on early Mars) are not well known. We analyzed drainage patterns on all three bodies and found that large drainages, which record interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation and erosional modification, conform much better to long-wavelength topography on Titan and Mars than on Earth. We use a numerical landscape evolution model to demonstrate that short-wavelength <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation causes drainage directions to diverge from long-wavelength topography, as observed on Earth. We attribute the observed differences to ancient long-wavelength topography on Mars, recent or ongoing generation of long-wavelength relief on Titan, and the creation of short-wavelength relief by plate tectonics on Earth.</p>

Imaging the distribution of transient viscosity after the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.1 Kumamoto earthquake
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation of mantle and crustal rocks in response to stress plays a crucial role in the distribution of seismic and volcanic hazards, controlling tectonic processes ranging from continental drift to earthquake triggering. However, the spatial variation of these dynamic properties is poorly understood as they are difficult to measure. We exploited the large stress perturbation incurred by the 2016 earthquake sequence in Kumamoto, Japan, to directly image localized and distributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation. The earthquakes illuminated distinct regions of low effective viscosity in the lower crust, notably beneath the Mount Aso and Mount Kuju volcanoes, surrounded by larger-scale variations of viscosity across the back-arc. This study demonstrates a new potential for geodesy to directly probe rock rheology in situ across many spatial and temporal scales.</p>

Grain boundary stability governs hardening and softening in extremely fine nanograined metals
<p>Conventional metals become harder with decreasing grain sizes, following the classical Hall-Petch relationship. However, this relationship fails and softening occurs at some grain sizes in the nanometer regime for some alloys. In this study, we discovered that plastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation mechanism of extremely fine nanograined metals and their hardness are adjustable through tailoring grain boundary (GB) stability. The electrodeposited nanograined nickel-molybdenum (Ni–Mo) samples become softened for grain sizes below 10 nanometers because of GB-mediated processes. With GB stabilization through relaxation and Mo segregation, ultrahigh hardness is achieved in the nanograined samples with a plastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation mechanism dominated by generation of extended partial dislocations. Grain boundary stability provides an alternative dimension, in addition to grain size, for producing novel nanograined metals with extraordinary properties.</p>

Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite infection of developing honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) pupae
<p>The ectoparasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. <i>Varroa</i> interacts with honey bee viruses, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring viruses, immunosuppression of the developing honey bee hosts by <i>Varroa</i> has been proposed to explain the synergy between viruses and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee immune suppression by <i>V. destructor</i> is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced <i>V. destructor</i> mites on immune gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed wing virus in the developing bees. Our data on different immune genes show little evidence for immunosuppression of honey bees by <i>V. destructor</i>. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative immune gene expression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed wing virus titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not immunosuppression may contribute to the synergy between viruses and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee immune genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple immune genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee immune system.</p>

A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and neurological status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB.

The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late neurological deterioration at a mean of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial drug treatment. The causes of neurological   deterioration were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without neurological deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no neurological deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from neurological deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial drug treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.

The rise, collapse, and compaction of Mt. Mantap from the 3 September 2017 North Korean nuclear test
<p>Surveillance of clandestine nuclear tests relies on a global seismic network, but the potential of spaceborne monitoring has been underexploited. We used satellite radar imagery to determine the complete surface displacement field of up to 3.5 meters of divergent horizontal motion with 0.5 meters of subsidence associated with North Korea’s largest underground nuclear test. Combining insight from geodetic and seismological remote sensing, we found that the aftermath of the initial explosive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation involved subsidence associated with subsurface collapse and aseismic compaction of the damaged rocks of the test site. The explosive yield from the nuclear detonation with best-fitting source parameters for 450-meter depth was 191 kilotonnes of TNT equivalent. Our results demonstrate the capability of spaceborne remote sensing to help characterize large underground nuclear tests.</p>

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor ductility owing to pyramidal [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made ductile by specific dilute solute additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued plastic straining during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for ductility as a function of alloy composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium alloys, and the solute-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium. The mechanistic theory can quickly screen for alloy compositions favoring conditions for high ductility and may help in the development of high-formability magnesium alloys.</p>

Observations and modeling of the elastogravity signals preceding direct seismic waves
<p>After an earthquake, the earliest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation signals are not expected to be carried by the fastest (<i>P</i>) elastic waves but by the speed-of-light changes of the gravitational field. However, these perturbations are weak and, so far, their detection has not been accurate enough to fully understand their origins and to use them for a highly valuable rapid estimate of the earthquake magnitude. We show that gravity perturbations are particularly well observed with broadband seismometers at distances between 1000 and 2000 kilometers from the source of the 2011, moment magnitude 9.1, Tohoku earthquake. We can accurately model them by a new formalism, taking into account both the gravity changes and the gravity-induced motion. These prompt elastogravity signals open the window for minute time-scale magnitude determination for great earthquakes.</p>

Three-dimensional mechanical metamaterials with a twist
<p>Rationally designed artificial materials enable mechanical properties that are inaccessible with ordinary materials. Pushing on an ordinary linearly elastic bar can cause it to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed in many ways. However, a twist, the counterpart of optical activity in the static case, is strictly zero. The unavailability of this degree of freedom hinders applications in terms of mode conversion and the realization of advanced mechanical designs using coordinate transformations. Here, we aim at realizing microstructured three-dimensional elastic chiral mechanical metamaterials that overcome this limitation. On overall millimeter-sized samples, we measure twists per axial strain exceeding 2°/%. Scaling up the number of unit cells for fixed sample dimensions, the twist is robust due to metamaterial stiffening, indicating a characteristic length scale and bringing the aforementioned applications into reach.</p>

Structure-property relationships from universal signatures of plasticity in disordered solids
<p>When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed beyond their elastic limits, crystalline solids flow plastically via particle rearrangements localized around structural defects. Disordered solids also flow, but without obvious structural defects. We link structure to plasticity in disordered solids via a microscopic structural quantity, “softness,” designed by machine learning to be maximally predictive of rearrangements. Experimental results and computations enabled us to measure the spatial correlations and strain response of softness, as well as two measures of plasticity: the size of rearrangements and the yield strain. All four quantities maintained remarkable commonality in their values for disordered packings of objects ranging from atoms to grains, spanning seven orders of magnitude in diameter and 13 orders of magnitude in elastic modulus. These commonalities link the spatial correlations and strain response of softness to rearrangement size and yield strain, respectively.</p>

Structures of the CRISPR genome integration complex
<p>CRISPR-Cas systems depend on the Cas1-Cas2 integrase to capture and integrate short foreign DNA fragments into the CRISPR locus, enabling adaptation to new viruses. We present crystal structures of Cas1-Cas2 bound to both donor and target DNA in intermediate and product integration complexes, as well as a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the full CRISPR locus integration complex, including the accessory protein IHF (integration host factor). The structures show unexpectedly that indirect sequence recognition dictates integration site selection by favoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation of the repeat and the flanking sequences. IHF binding bends the DNA sharply, bringing an upstream recognition motif into contact with Cas1 to increase both the specificity and efficiency of integration. These results explain how the Cas1-Cas2 CRISPR integrase recognizes a sequence-dependent DNA structure to ensure site-selective CRISPR array expansion during the initial step of bacterial adaptive immunity.</p>

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally transmitted Zika virus has been documented in the United States this year, a reflection of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with efforts to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid spread of the virus through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population immune. This so-called "herd immunity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika virus to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of transmission between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a vaccine against Zika, which caused widespread alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the virus while they were pregnant. But with transmission in the region becoming scarce, it does complicate efforts of clinical trials that hope to show lower rates of transmission and disease in vaccinated people. One such trial is underway right now.</p>

A unified continental thickness from seismology and diamonds suggests a melt-defined plate
<p>Thick, rigid continents move over the weaker underlying mantle, although geophysical and geochemical constraints on the exact thickness and defining mechanism of the continental plates are widely discrepant. Xenoliths suggest a chemical continental lithosphere ~175 kilometers thick, whereas seismic tomography supports a much thicker root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled <i>SS</i> precursor waveforms from continental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at depths of 130 to 190 kilometers. The discontinuity depth is well correlated with the origin depths of diamond-bearing xenoliths and corresponds to the transition from coarse to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ed xenoliths. At this depth, the xenolith-derived geotherm also intersects the carbonate-silicate solidus, suggesting that partial melt defines the plate boundaries beneath the continental interior.</p>

Complex multifault rupture during the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.8 Kaikōura earthquake, New Zealand
<p>On 14 November 2016, northeastern South Island of New Zealand was struck by a major moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 7.8 earthquake. Field observations, in conjunction with interferometric synthetic aperture radar, Global Positioning System, and seismology data, reveal this to be one of the most complex earthquakes ever recorded. The rupture propagated northward for more than 170 kilometers along both mapped and unmapped faults before continuing offshore at the island’s northeastern extent. Geodetic and field observations reveal surface ruptures along at least 12 major faults, including possible slip along the southern Hikurangi subduction interface; extensive uplift along much of the coastline; and widespread anelastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation, including the ~8-meter uplift of a fault-bounded block. This complex earthquake defies many conventional assumptions about the degree to which earthquake ruptures are controlled by fault segmentation and should motivate reevaluation of these issues in seismic hazard models.</p>

Distortion of histone octamer core promotes nucleosome mobilization by a chromatin remodeler
<p>Adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes play essential biological roles by mobilizing nucleosomal DNA. Yet, how DNA is mobilized despite the steric constraints placed by the histone octamer remains unknown. Using methyl transverse relaxation–optimized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a 450-kilodalton complex, we show that the chromatin remodeler, SNF2h, distorts the histone octamer. Binding of SNF2h in an activated ATP state changes the dynamics of buried histone residues. Preventing octamer distortion by site-specific disulfide linkages inhibits nucleosome sliding by SNF2h while promoting octamer eviction by the SWI-SNF complex, RSC. Our findings indicate that the histone core of a nucleosome is more plastic than previously imagined and that octamer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation plays different roles based on the type of chromatin remodeler. Octamer plasticity may contribute to chromatin regulation beyond ATP-dependent remodeling.</p>

Command of active matter by topological defects and patterns
<p>Self-propelled bacteria are marvels of nature with a potential to power dynamic materials and microsystems of the future. The challenge lies in commanding their chaotic behavior. By dispersing swimming <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> in a liquid crystalline environment with spatially varying orientation of the anisotropy axis, we demonstrate control over the distribution of bacterial concentration, as well as the geometry and polarity of their trajectories. Bacteria recognize subtle differences in liquid crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ations, engaging in bipolar swimming in regions of pure splay and bend but switching to unipolar swimming in mixed splay-bend regions. They differentiate topological defects, heading toward defects of positive topological charge and avoiding negative charges. Sensitivity of bacteria to preimposed orientational patterns represents a previously unknown facet of the interplay between hydrodynamics and topology of active matter.</p>

Dynamic creation and evolution of gradient nanostructure in single-crystal metallic microcubes
<p>We demonstrate the dynamic creation and subsequent static evolution of extreme gradient nanograined structures in initially near–defect-free single-crystal silver microcubes. Extreme nanostructural transformations are imposed by high strain rates, strain gradients, and recrystallization in high-velocity impacts of the microcubes against an impenetrable substrate. We synthesized the silver microcubes in a bottom-up seed-growth process and use an advanced laser-induced projectile impact testing apparatus to selectively launch them at supersonic velocities (~400 meters per second). Our study provides new insights into the fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation mechanisms and the effects of crystal and sample-shape symmetries resulting from high-velocity impacts. The nanostructural transformations produced in our experiments show promising pathways to developing gradient nanograined metals for engineering applications requiring both high strength and high toughness—for example, in structural components of aircraft and spacecraft.</p>

Localized seismic deformation in the upper mantle revealed by dense seismic arrays
<p>Seismicity along continental transform faults is usually confined to the upper half of the crust, but the Newport-Inglewood fault (NIF), a major fault traversing the Los Angeles basin, is seismically active down to the upper mantle. We use seismic array analysis to illuminate the seismogenic root of the NIF beneath Long Beach, California, and identify seismicity in an actively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ing localized zone penetrating the lithospheric mantle. Deep earthquakes, which are spatially correlated with geochemical evidence of a fluid pathway from the mantle, as well as with a sharp vertical offset in the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, exhibit narrow size distribution and weak temporal clustering. We attribute these characteristics to a transition from strong to weak interaction regimes in a system of seismic asperities embedded in a ductile fault zone matrix.</p>

High-resolution lithosphere viscosity and dynamics revealed by magnetotelluric imaging
<p>An accurate viscosity structure is critical to truthfully modeling lithosphere dynamics. Here, we report an attempt to infer the effective lithospheric viscosity from a high-resolution magnetotelluric (MT) survey across the western United States. The high sensitivity of MT fields to the presence of electrically conductive fluids makes it a promising proxy for determining mechanical strength variations throughout the lithosphere. We demonstrate how a viscosity structure, approximated from electrical resistivity, results in a geodynamic model that successfully predicts short-wavelength surface topography, lithospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation, and mantle upwelling beneath recent volcanism. We further show that this viscosity is physically consistent with and better constrained than that derived from laboratory-based rheology. We conclude that MT imaging provides a practical observational constraint for quantifying the dynamic evolution of the continental lithosphere.</p>

Reversible Leaf Xylem Collapse: A Potential “Circuit Breaker” against Cavitation
<p>We report a novel form of xylem dysfunction in angiosperms: reversible collapse of the xylem conduits of the smallest vein orders that demarcate and intrusively irrigate the areoles of red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy revealed gradual increases in collapse from approximately −2 MPa down to −3 MPa, saturating thereafter (to −4 MPa). Over this range, cavitation remained negligible in these veins. Imaging of rehydration experiments showed spatially variable recovery from collapse within 20 s and complete recovery after 2 min. More broadly, the patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation induced by desiccation in both mesophyll and xylem suggest that cell wall collapse is unlikely to depend solely on individual wall properties, as mechanical constraints imposed by neighbors appear to be important. From the perspective of equilibrium leaf water potentials, petioles, whose vessels extend into the major veins, showed a vulnerability to cavitation that overlapped in the water potential domain with both minor vein collapse and buckling (turgor loss) of the living cells. However, models of transpiration transients showed that minor vein collapse and mesophyll capacitance could effectively buffer major veins from cavitation over time scales relevant to the rectification of stomatal wrong-way responses. We suggest that, for angiosperms, whose subsidiary cells give up large volumes to allow large stomatal apertures at the cost of potentially large wrong-way responses, vein collapse could make an important contribution to these plants’ ability to transpire near the brink of cavitation-inducing water potentials.</p>

Strain data have been collected during feeding across a wide range of mammals; in contrast, <i>in vivo</i> cranial bone strain data have been collected from few sauropsid taxa. Here we present bone strain data recorded from the jugal of the herbivorous agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> along with simultaneously recorded bite force. Principal and shear strain magnitudes in <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> were lower than cranial bone strains recorded in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, but higher than those reported from herbivorous mammals. Our results suggest that variations in principal strain orientations in the facial skeleton are largely due to differences in feeding behavior and bite location, whereas food type has little impact on strain orientations. Furthermore, mean principal strain orientations differ between male and female <i>Uromastyx</i> during feeding, potentially because of sexual dimorphism in skull morphology.</p>

Biomechanics of substrate boring by fig wasps
<p>Female insects of diverse orders bore into substrates to deposit their eggs. Such insects must overcome several biomechanical challenges to successfully oviposit, which include the selection of suitable substrates through which the ovipositor can penetrate without itself fracturing. In many cases, the insect may also need to steer and manipulate the ovipositor within the substrate to deliver eggs at desired locations before rapidly retracting her ovipositor to avoid predation. In the case of female parasitoid ichneumonid wasps, this process is repeated multiple times during her lifetime, thus testing the ability of the ovipositioning apparatus to endure fracture and fatigue. What specific adaptations does the ovipositioning apparatus of a female ichneumonoid wasp possess to withstand these challenges? We addressed this question using a model system composed of parasitoid and pollinator fig wasps. First, we show that parasitoid ovipositor tips have teeth-like structures, preferentially enriched with zinc, unlike the smooth morphology of pollinator ovipositors. We describe sensillae present on the parasitoid ovipositor tip that are likely to aid in the detection of chemical species and mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ations and sample microenvironments within the substrate. Second, using atomic force microscopy, we show that parasitoid tip regions have a higher modulus compared with regions proximal to the abdomen in parasitoid and pollinator ovipositors. Finally, we use videography to film wasps during substrate boring and analyse buckling of the ovipositor to estimate the forces required for substrate boring. Together, these results allow us to describe the biomechanical principles underlying substrate boring in parasitoid ichneumonid wasps. Such studies may be useful for the biomimetic design of surgical tools and in the use of novel mechanisms to bore through hard substrates.</p>

Ankle joint pressure changes in high tibial and distal femoral osteotomies
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>To assess the effect of high tibial and distal femoral osteotomies   (HTO and DFO) on the pressure characteristics of the ankle joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Varus and valgus malalignment of the knee was simulated in human   cadaver full-length legs. Testing included four measurements: baseline   malalignment, 5° and 10° re-aligning osteotomy, and control baseline   malalignment. For HTO, testing was rerun with the subtalar joint   fixed. In order to represent half body weight, a 300 N force was applied   onto the femoral head. Intra-articular sensors captured ankle pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the absence of restriction of subtalar movement, insignificant   migration of the centre of force and changes of maximal pressure   were seen at the ankle joint. With restricted subtalar motion, more   significant lateralisation of the centre of force were seen with   the subtalar joint in varus than in valgus position. Changes in   maximum pressure were again not significant. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The re-alignment of coronal plane knee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ities by HTO and   DFO altered ankle pressure characteristics. When the subtalar joint   was fixed in the varus position, migration of centre of force after   HTO was more significant than when the subtalar joint was fixed   in valgus.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:59–65.</p></sec>

Instability of the hip after anatomical  re-alignment in patients with a slipped capital femoral epiphysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Several studies have reported the safety and efficacy of subcapital   re-alignment for patients with slipped capital femoral epiphysis   (SCFE) using surgical dislocation of the hip and an extended retinacular   flap. Instability of the hip and dislocation as a consequence of   this surgery has only recently gained attention. We discuss this   problem with some illustrative cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We explored the literature on the possible pathophysiological   causes and surgical steps associated with the risk of post-operative   instability and articular damage. In addition, we describe supplementary   steps that could be used to avoid these problems.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The causes of instability may be divided into three main groups:   the first includes causes directly related to SCFE (acetabular labral   damage, severe abrasion of the acetabular cartilage, flattening   of the acetabular roof and a bell-shaped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ity of the epiphysis);   the second, causes not related to the SCFE (acetabular orientation   and poor quality of the soft tissues); the third, causes directly   related to the surgery (capsulotomy, division of the ligamentum teres,   shortening of the femoral neck, pelvi-trochanteric impingement,   previous proximal femoral osteotomy and post-operative positioning   of the leg).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present examples drawn from our clinical practice, as well   as possible ways of reducing the risks of these complications, and   of correcting them if they happen.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:16–21.</p></sec>

The quality of Achilles tendon repair five to eight years after percutaneous tenotomy in the treatment of clubfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to describe the mid-term appearances of the repair   process of the Achilles tendon after tenotomy in children with a   clubfoot treated using the Ponseti method.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 15 children (ten boys, five girls) with idiopathic   clubfoot were evaluated at a mean of 6.8 years (5.4 to 8.1) after   complete percutaneous division of the Achilles tendon. The contour   and subjective thickness of the tendon were recorded, and superficial   defects and its strength were assessed clinically. The echogenicity,   texture, thickness, peritendinous irregularities and potential for   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation of the tendon were evaluated by ultrasonography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The appearance of the Achilles tendon was slightly abnormal,   with more thickening and less conspicuous contours than a normal   tendon. Its strength was grossly normal, with no insufficiency of   the triceps surae. Ultrasonographic findings revealed a mild fusiform   thickening in 12 children (80%). The tissue at the site of the repair   had a slightly hypoechoic, fibrillar quality with hyperechoic striation   and the anterior contour was irregular and blurred. There was a   focal narrowing within the healing tissue in two children.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This mid-term evaluation of the ability of the Achilles tendon   to repair after division suggests a combination of intrinsic and   extrinsic mechanisms. There were minor abnormalities which did not   appear to affect function.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:139–44.</p></sec>

Quantifying the ‘law of diminishing returns’ in magnetically controlled growing rods
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) allow non-invasive   correction of the spinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ity in the treatment of early-onset   scoliosis. Conventional growing rod systems (CGRS) need repeated   surgical distractions: these are associated with the effect of the   ‘law of diminishing returns’.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to quantify this effect in   MCGRs over sequential distractions. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 35 patients with a maximum follow-up of 57 months   were included in the study. There were 17 boys and 18 girls with   a mean age of 7.4 years (2 to 14). True Distraction (TD) was determined   by measuring the expansion gap on fluoroscopy. This was compared   with Intended Distraction (ID) and expressed as the ‘T/I’ ratio.   The T/I ratio and the Cobb angle were calculated at several time   points during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 30 months (6 to 57). There was a significant   decrease in the mean T/I ratio over time (convex rod at 3 months   0.81, <sc>sd</sc> 0.58 <i>vs</i> 51 months 0.17, <sc>sd </sc>0.16,    p = 0.0001; concave rod at 3 months 0.93, <sc>sd</sc> 0.67 <i>vs</i> 51   months 0.18, <sc>sd</sc> 0.15, p = 0.0001). A linear decline of   the mean T/I ratios was noted for both convex rods (r<sup>2</sup> =   0.90, p = 0.004) and concave rods (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.81, p = 0.015)   over 51 months. At the 24-month follow-up stage, there was a significant   negative correlation between the mean T/I ratio of the concave rod   with weight (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), age (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), and   BMI of the child (r = -0.54,    p = 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ‘law of diminishing returns’ is also seen after serial distraction   using MCGR. Compared to previously published data for CGRS, there   is a gradual linear decline rather than a rapid initial decline   in lengthening. In older, heavier children a reduced distraction   ratio in the concave rod of the MCGR device is noted over time.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1658–64.</p></sec>

Persistent Long-Term Structural, Functional, and Metabolic Changes After Stress-Induced (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly recognized acute heart failure syndrome precipitated by intense emotional stress. Although there is an apparent rapid and spontaneous recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction, the long-term clinical and functional consequences of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are ill-defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In an observational case-control study, we recruited 37 patients with prior (>12-month) takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and 37 age-, sex-, and comorbidity-matched control subjects. Patients completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. All participants underwent detailed clinical phenotypic characterization, including serum biomarker analysis, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, echocardiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance including cardiac <sup>31</sup>P-spectroscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Participants were predominantly middle-age (64±11 years) women (97%). Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurred 20 (range 13–39) months before the study, the majority (88%) of patients had persisting symptoms compatible with heart failure (median of 13 [range 0–76] in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) and cardiac limitation on exercise testing (reduced peak oxygen consumption, 24±1.3 versus 31±1.3 mL/kg/min, <i>P</i><0.001; increased VE/V<sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> slope, 31±1 versus 26±1, <i>P</i>=0.002). Despite normal left ventricular ejection fraction and serum biomarkers, patients with prior takotsubo cardiomyopathy had impaired cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deform</span></strong>ation indices (reduced apical circumferential strain, −16±1.0 versus −23±1.5%, <i>P</i><0.001; global longitudinal strain, −17±1 versus −20±1%, <i>P</i>=0.006), increased native T1 mapping values (1264±10 versus 1184±10 ms, <i>P</i><0.001), and impaired cardiac energetic status (phosphocreatine/γ-adenosine triphosphate ratio, 1.3±0.1 versus 1.9±0.1, <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In contrast to previous perceptions, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has long-lasting clinical consequences, including demonstrable symptomatic and functional impairment associated with persistent subclinical cardiac dysfunction. Taken together our findings demonstrate that after takotsubo cardiomyopathy, patients develop a persistent, long-term heart failure phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Multimessenger observations of a flaring blazar coincident with high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A
<p>Previous detections of individual astrophysical sources of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong>s are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong>s remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong>, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera–electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray–emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong>s.</p>

Neutrino emission from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056 prior to the IceCube-170922A alert
<p>A high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> observations to search for excess emission at the position of the blazar. We found an excess of high-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5σ evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode. This suggests that blazars are identifiable sources of the high-energy astrophysical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> flux.</p>

Observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
<p>The coherent elastic scattering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong>s off nuclei has eluded detection for four decades, even though its predicted cross section is by far the largest of all low-energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> couplings. This mode of interaction offers new opportunities to study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> properties and leads to a miniaturization of detector size, with potential technological applications. We observed this process at a 6.7σ confidence level, using a low-background, 14.6-kilogram CsI[Na] scintillator exposed to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> emissions from the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Characteristic signatures in energy and time, predicted by the standard model for this process, were observed in high signal-to-background conditions. Improved constraints on nonstandard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutrino</span></strong> interactions with quarks are derived from this initial data set.</p>

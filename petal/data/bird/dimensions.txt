Unsatisfactory outcomes following unicompartmental knee arthroplasty in patients with partial thickness cartilage loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>While medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is indicated   for patients with full-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss, it is occasionally   used to treat those with partial-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss. The aim of this   study was to investigate the five-year outcomes in a consecutive   series of UKAs used in patients with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage   loss in the medial compartment of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 94 consecutive UKAs were undertaken in   90 patients with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss and followed up   independently for a mean of six years (1 to 13). These patients   had partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss either on both femur and tibia   (13 knees), or on either the femur or the tibia, with full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness   loss on the other surface of the joint (18 and 63 knees respectively).   Using propensity score analysis, these patients were matched 1:2 based   on age, gender and pre-operative Oxford Knee Score (OKS) with knees   with full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss on both the femur and tibia. The functional   outcomes, implant survival and incidence of re-operations were assessed   at one, two and five years post-operatively. A subgroup of 36 knees   in 36 patients with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss, who had pre-operative   MRI scans, was assessed to identify whether there were any factors   identified on MRI that predicted the outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Knees with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss had significantly   worse functional outcomes at one, two and five years post-operatively   compared with those with full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss. A quarter of knees   with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss had a fair or poor result and a fifth   failed to achieve a clinically significant improvement in OKS from   a baseline of four points or more; double that seen in knees with   full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss. Whilst there was no difference in implant survival between   the groups, the rate of re-operation in knees with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness   loss was three times higher. Most of the re-operations (three-quarters),   were arthroscopies for persistent pain.</p><p>Compared with those achieving good or excellent outcomes, patients   with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss who achieved fair or poor   outcomes were younger and had worse pre-operative functional scores.   However, there were no other differences in the baseline demographics.   MRI findings of full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness cartilage loss, subchondral oedema,   synovitis or effusion did not provide additional prognostic information.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Medial UKA should be reserved for patients with full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness   cartilage loss on both the femur and tibia. Whilst some patients   with partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness loss achieve a good result we cannot currently   identify which these will be and in this situation MRI is unhelpful   and misleading.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:475–82.</p></sec>

Tree Physiology
Root diameter variations explained by anatomy and phylogeny of 50 tropical and temperate tree species
<p>Root <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er, a critical indicator of root physiological function, varies greatly among tree species, but the underlying mechanism of this high variability is unclear. Here, we sampled 50 tree species across tropical and temperate zones in China, and measured root morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between root <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er, cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and stele <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er among tree species in tropical and temperate forests, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both root morphological and anatomical traits with divergence time during species radiation. The results showed that root <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er was strongly affected by cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness but less by stele <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er in both tropical and temperate species. Changes in cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness explained over 90% of variation in root <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er for the first order, and ∼74–87% for the second and third orders. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>er roots displayed greater cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and more cortical cell layers than thinner roots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that root <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er, cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with divergence time at the family level, showing similar variation trends in geological time. The results also suggested that trees tend to decrease their root cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness rather than stele <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er during species radiation. The close linkage of variations in root morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 tree species should provide some insights into the mechanism of root <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er variability among tree species.</p>

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome measures were (1) process measures at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study these associations with hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process measures than higher-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e hospitals. Higher hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10). There was a weak association of higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>es with lower 6-month mortality (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; <i>P</i>=0.001) and lower 6-month all-cause readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95%, CI 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.025).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis of a large contemporary prospective national quality improvement registry of older patients with HF indicates that hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e as a structural metric correlates with process measures, but not with 30-day outcomes, and only marginally with outcomes up to 6 months of follow-up.

Topological insulator laser: Theory
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators are phases of matter characterized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder. These attributes make <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical effects in a unique way: the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser. These are lasers whose lasing mode exhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport without magnetic fields. The underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties lead to a highly efficient laser, robust to defects and disorder, with single-mode lasing even at very high gain values. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and at the same time opens exciting possibilities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical physics, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser provides a route to arrays of semiconductor lasers that operate as one single-mode high-power laser coupled efficiently into an output port.</p>

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p>Proteins fold into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined computational protein <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and stability in uncharted protein space. Iteration between <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> and experiment increased the <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ies where <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> into a data-driven science.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Genetic Architecture and Molecular Networks Underlying Leaf Thickness in Desert-Adapted Tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>er leaves allow plants to grow in water-limited conditions. However, our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this highly functional leaf shape trait is poor. We used a custom-built confocal profilometer to directly measure leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness in a set of introgression lines (ILs) derived from the desert tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i> and identified quantitative trait loci. We report evidence of a complex genetic architecture of this trait and roles for both genetic and environmental factors. Several ILs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> leaves have dramatically elongated palisade mesophyll cells and, in some cases, increased leaf ploidy. We characterized the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> IL2-5 and IL4-3 in detail and found increased mesophyll cell size and leaf ploidy levels, suggesting that endoreduplication underpins leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness in tomato. Next, we queried the transcriptomes and inferred dynamic Bayesian networks of gene expression across early leaf ontogeny in these lines to compare the molecular networks that pattern leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> ILs share <i>S. pennellii</i>-like expression profiles for putative regulators of cell shape and meristem determinacy as well as a general signature of cell cycle-related gene expression. However, our network data suggest that leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness in these two lines is patterned at least partially by distinct mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, double homozygote lines combining introgression segments from these two ILs show additive phenotypes, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> leaves, higher ploidy levels, and larger palisade mesophyll cells. Collectively, these data establish a framework of genetic, anatomical, and molecular mechanisms that pattern leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness in desert-adapted tomato.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">height</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> and stem <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">height</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-based Plant <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">height</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate plant <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">height</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Experiments
<p>Physical systems exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical invariants are naturally endowed with robustness against perturbations, as manifested in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulators—materials exhibiting robust electron transport, immune from scattering by defects and disorder. Recent years have witnessed intense efforts toward exploiting these phenomena in photonics. Here we demonstrate a nonmagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulator laser system exhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected transport in the cavity. Its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties give rise to single-mode lasing, robustness against defects, and considerably higher slope efficiencies compared to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically trivial counterparts. We further exploit the properties of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical platforms by assembling the system from <i>S</i>-chiral microresonators, enforcing predetermined unidirectional lasing without magnetic fields. This work paves the way toward active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical devices with exciting properties and functionalities.</p>

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

Cryo–electron microscopy structures of six <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s are close to the computational <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> models. The filament building blocks are idealized repeat proteins, and thus the <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er of the filaments can be systematically tuned by varying the number of repeat units.

The ability to generate dynamic, highly ordered structures that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> micrometers from protein monomers opens up possibilities for the fabrication of new multiscale metamaterials.</p>

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries
<p>Resonant cavities are essential building blocks governing many wave-based phenomena, but their geometry and reciprocity fundamentally limit the integration of optical devices. We report, at telecommunication wave<strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">length</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s, geometry-independent and integrated nonreciprocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical cavities that couple stimulated emission from one-way photonic edge states to a selected waveguide output with an isolation ratio in excess of 10 decibels. Nonreciprocity originates from unidirectional edge states at the boundary between photonic structures with distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical invariants. Our experimental demonstration of lasing from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical cavities provides the opportunity to develop complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical circuitry of arbitrary <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>es for the integrated and robust generation and transport of photons in classical and quantum regimes.</p>

A unified continental thickness from seismology and diamonds suggests a melt-defined plate
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>, rigid continents move over the weaker underlying mantle, although geophysical and geochemical constraints on the exact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and defining mechanism of the continental plates are widely discrepant. Xenoliths suggest a chemical continental lithosphere ~175 kilometers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>, whereas seismic tomography supports a much <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>er root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled <i>SS</i> precursor waveforms from continental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s of 130 to 190 kilometers.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased soil strength due to soil compaction or soil drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in soils of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er influences root elongation under different levels of soil strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased soil strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in soil columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high soil strength. Under moderate and high soil strength, smaller root tip radius-to-<strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">length</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-<strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">length</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in soils with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased soil strength. Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ening was bounded by a maximum <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased soil strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in soils of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high soil strength.</p>

Predictors and Association With Clinical Outcomes of the Changes in Exercise Capacity After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>At present, there are no objective data specifically examining the clinical impact of variations in exercise capacity post–transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We describe the changes in exercise capacity between baseline and 6 months post-TAVR, and ascertain factors associated with and clinical implications of a lack of improvement in exercise capacity post-TAVR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 305 patients (mean age, 79±9 years; 44% men; Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk mortality score, 6.7±4.2%) undergoing TAVR completed both baseline and follow-up exercise capacity assessments at 6 months post-TAVR.

Partitioning of vessel resistivity in three liana species
<p>Vessels with simple perforation plates, found in the majority of angiosperms, are considered the evolutionarily most advanced conduits, least impeding the xylem sap flow. Nevertheless, when measured, their hydraulic resistivity (<i>R</i>, i.e., inverse value of hydraulic conductivity) is significantly higher than resistivity predicted using Hagen–Poiseuille equation (<i>R</i><sub>HP</sub>). In our study we aimed (i) to quantify two basic components of the total vessel resistivity – vessel lumen resistivity and end wall resistivity, and (ii) to analyze how the variable inner <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er of the vessel along its longitudinal axis affects resistivity. We measured flow rates through progressively shortened stems of hop (<i>Humulus lupulus</i> L.), grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i> L.), and clematis (<i>Clematis vitalba</i> L.) and used elastomer injection for identification of open vessels and for measurement of changing vessel inner <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ers along its axis. The relative contribution of end wall resistivity to total vessel resistivity was 0.46 for hop, 0.55 for grapevine, and 0.30 for clematis. Vessel lumen resistivity calculated from our measurements was substantially higher than theoretical resistivity – about 43% for hop, 58% for grapevine, and 52% for clematis. We identified variation in the vessel inner <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er as an important source of vessel resistivity. The coefficient of variation of vessel inner <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er was a good predictor for the increase of the ratio of integral <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> to <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> calculated from the mean value of inner vessel <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er. We discuss the fact that we dealt with the longest vessels in a given stem sample, which may lead to the overestimation of vessel lumen resistivity, which consequently precludes decision whether the variable vessel inner <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er explains fully the difference between vessel lumen resistivity and <i>R</i><sub>HP</sub> we observed.</p>

To probe their interplay, we synthesized one-dimensional chiral symmetric wires with controllable disorder via spectroscopic Hamiltonian engineering, based on the laser-driven coupling of discrete momentum states of ultracold atoms. Measuring the bulk evolution of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical indicator after a sudden quench, we observed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical Anderson insulator phase, in which added disorder drives the band structure of a wire from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically trivial to nontrivial. In addition, we observed the robustness of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically nontrivial wires to weak disorder and measured the transition to a trivial phase in the presence of strong disorder. Atomic interactions in this quantum simulation platform may enable realizations of strongly interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical fluids.</p>

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the structural space <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary structures and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local structures not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable structures that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s predicted to fold into single stable structures, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of 9 of 12 <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of structures possible for short peptide macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> and library selection methods.</p>

Quantized electric multipole insulators
<p>The Berry phase provides a modern formulation of electric polarization in crystals. We extend this concept to higher electric multipole moments and determine the necessary conditions and minimal models for which the quadrupole and octupole moments are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically quantized electromagnetic observables. Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical phases. Furthermore, they host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating phases of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical behavior that can be immediately tested. Our work opens a venue for the expansion of the classification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical phases of matter.</p>

Principles for designing proteins with cavities formed by curved β sheets
<p>Active sites and ligand-binding cavities in native proteins are often formed by curved β sheets, and the ability to control β-sheet curvature would allow <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> of binding proteins with cavities customized to specific ligands. Toward this end, we investigated the mechanisms controlling β-sheet curvature by studying the geometry of β sheets in naturally occurring protein structures and folding simulations. The principles emerging from this analysis were used to <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>, de novo, a series of proteins with curved β sheets topped with α helices. Nuclear magnetic resonance and crystal structures of the <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s closely match the computational models, showing that β-sheet curvature can be controlled with atomic-level accuracy.

Large Crown Root Number Improves Topsoil Foraging and Phosphorus Acquisition
<p>Suboptimal phosphorus (P) availability is a primary constraint to plant growth on Earth. We tested the hypothesis that maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) genotypes with large crown root number (CN) will have shallower rooting <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> and improved P acquisition from low-P soils. Maize recombinant inbred lines with contrasting CN were evaluated under suboptimal P availability in greenhouse mesocosms and the field. Under P stress in mesocosms, the large-CN phenotype had 48% greater root respiration, 24% shallower rooting <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>, 32% greater root <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">length</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> density in the topsoil, 37% greater leaf P concentration, 48% greater leaf photosynthesis, 33% greater stomatal conductance, and 44% greater shoot biomass than the small-CN phenotype. Under P stress in the field, the large-CN phenotype had 32% shallower rooting <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>, 51% greater root <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">length</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> density in the topsoil, 44% greater leaf P concentration, 18% greater leaf photosynthesis, 21% greater stomatal conductance, 23% greater shoot biomass at anthesis, and 28% greater yield than the small-CN phenotype. These results support the hypothesis that large CN improves plant P acquisition from low-P soils by reducing rooting <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> and increasing topsoil foraging. The large-CN phenotype merits consideration as a selection target to improve P capture in maize and possibly other cereal crops.</p>

Cold acclimation alters the connective tissue content of the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) heart
<p>Thermal acclimation can alter cardiac function and morphology in a number of fish species, but little is known about the regulation of these changes. The purpose of the present study was to determine how cold acclimation affects zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) cardiac morphology, collagen composition and connective tissue regulation. Heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the compact myocardium, collagen content and collagen fiber composition were compared between control (27°C) and cold-acclimated (20°C) zebrafish using serially sectioned hearts stained with Picrosirius Red. Collagen content and fiber composition of the pericardial membrane were also examined. Cold acclimation did not affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e of the contracted heart; however, there was a significant decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the compact myocardium. There was also a decrease in the collagen content of the compact myocardium and in the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> collagen fibers throughout the heart. Cold-acclimated zebrafish also increased expression of the gene transcript for matrix metalloproteinase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and collagen Type I α1. We propose that the reduction in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness of the compact myocardium as well as the change in collagen content may help to maintain the compliance of the ventricle as temperatures decrease. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the zebrafish heart undergoes significant remodeling in response to cold acclimation.</p>

Tunable intrinsic strain in two-dimensional transition metal electrocatalysts
<p>Tuning surface strain is a powerful strategy for tailoring the reactivity of metal catalysts. Traditionally, surface strain is imposed by external stress from a heterogeneous substrate, but the effect is often obscured by interfacial reconstructions and nanocatalyst <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>es. Here, we report on a strategy to resolve these problems by exploiting intrinsic surface stresses in two-dimensional transition metal nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations indicate that attractive interactions between surface atoms lead to tensile surface stresses that exert a pressure on the order of 10<sup>5</sup> atmospheres on the surface atoms and impart up to 10% compressive strain, with the exact <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">magnitud</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>e inversely proportional to the nanosheet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness. Atomic-level control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness thus enables generation and fine-tuning of intrinsic strain to optimize catalytic reactivity, which was confirmed experimentally on Pd(110) nanosheets for the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, with activity enhancements that were more than an order of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">magnitud</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>e greater than those of their nanoparticle counterparts.</p>

Electrically tunable low-density superconductivity in a monolayer topological insulator
<p>Turning on superconductivity in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ically nontrivial insulator may provide a route to search for non-Abelian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical states.

Fabricated into a van der Waals field-effect transistor, the monolayer’s ground state can be continuously gate-tuned from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical insulating to the superconducting state, with critical temperatures <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> up to ~1 kelvin.

Oklahoma's induced seismicity strongly linked to wastewater injection depth
<p>The sharp rise in Oklahoma seismicity since 2009 is due to wastewater injection. The role of injection <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> is an open, complex issue, yet critical for hazard assessment and regulation.

We found that injection <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> relative to crystalline basement most strongly correlates with seismic moment release. The joint effects of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e are critical, as injection rate becomes more influential near the basement interface.

Observation of bulk Fermi arc and polarization half charge from paired exceptional points
<p>The ideas of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>y have found tremendous success in closed physical systems, but even richer properties exist in the more general open or dissipative framework. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a bulk Fermi arc that develops from non-Hermitian radiative losses in an open system of photonic crystal slabs. Moreover, we discover half-integer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical charges in the polarization of far-field radiation around the bulk Fermi arc. Both phenomena are shown to be direct consequences of the non-Hermitian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical properties of exceptional points, where resonances coincide in their frequencies and line<strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">width</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s.

Topological origin of equatorial waves

We show a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">topolog</span></strong>ical origin for two well-known equatorially trapped waves, the Kelvin and Yanai modes, owing to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by Earth’s rotation. The nontrivial structure of the bulk PoincaréÉééé wave modes encoded through the first Chern number of value 2 guarantees the existence of these waves.

Structure-property relationships from universal signatures of plasticity in disordered solids
<p>When deformed beyond their elastic limits, crystalline solids flow plastically via particle rearrangements localized around structural defects. Disordered solids also flow, but without obvious structural defects. We link structure to plasticity in disordered solids via a microscopic structural quantity, “softness,” <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ed by machine learning to be maximally predictive of rearrangements. Experimental results and computations enabled us to measure the spatial correlations and strain response of softness, as well as two measures of plasticity: the size of rearrangements and the yield strain. All four quantities maintained remarkable commonality in their values for disordered packings of objects ranging from atoms to grains, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ning seven orders of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">magnitud</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>e in <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er and 13 orders of <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">magnitud</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>e in elastic modulus.

Nanoscale-length control of the flagellar driveshaft requires hitting the tethered outer membrane
<p>The bacterial flagellum exemplifies a system where even small deviations from the highly regulated flagellar assembly process can abolish motility and cause negative physiological outcomes. Consequently, bacteria have evolved elegant and robust regulatory mechanisms to ensure that flagellar morphogenesis follows a defined path, with each component self-assembling to predetermined dimensions. The flagellar rod acts as a driveshaft to transmit torque from the cytoplasmic rotor to the external filament. The rod self-assembles to a defined <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">length</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> of ~25 nanometers. Here, we provide evidence that rod <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">length</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> is limited by the <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">width</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> of the periplasmic space between the inner and outer membranes.

Sc2.0 chromosome <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> was implemented with BioStudio, an open-source framework developed for eukaryotic genome <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>, which coordinates <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> modifications from nucleotide to genome scales and enforces version control to systematically track edits. To achieve complete Sc2.0 genome synthesis, individual synthetic chromosomes built by Sc2.0 Consortium teams around the world will be consolidated into a single strain by “endoreduplication intercross.” Chemically synthesized genomes like Sc2.0 are fully customizable and allow experimentalists to ask otherwise intractable questions about chromosome structure, function, and evolution with a bottom-up <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> strategy.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient availability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e per root <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">length</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> (an indicator of RCS) decreased with <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e per root <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">length</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

Apparent Overinvestment in Leaf Venation Relaxes Leaf Morphological Constraints on Photosynthesis in Arid Habitats
<p>Leaf veins supply the mesophyll with water that evaporates when stomata are open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Theoretical analyses suggest that water is optimally distributed in the mesophyll when the lateral <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">distanc</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>e between veins (<i>d</i><sub>x</sub>) is equal to the <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">distanc</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>e from these veins to the epidermis (<i>d</i><sub>y</sub>), expressed as <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ≈ 1. Although this theory is supported by observations of many derived angiosperms, we hypothesize that plants in arid environments may reduce <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> below unity owing to climate-specific functional adaptations of increased leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and increased vein density. To test our hypothesis, we assembled leaf hydraulic, morphological, and photosynthetic traits of 68 species from the <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Corymbia</i> genera (termed eucalypts) along an aridity gradient in southwestern Australia. We inferred the potential gas-exchange advantage of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> using a model that links leaf morphology and hydraulics to photosynthesis. Our observations reveal that eucalypts in arid environments have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong> amphistomatous leaves with high vein densities, resulting in <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ratios that range from 1.6 to 0.15 along the aridity gradient. Our model suggests that, as leaves become <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>er, the effect of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> is to offset the reduction in leaf gas exchange that would result from maintaining <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> at unity. This apparent overinvestment in leaf venation may be explained from the selective pressure of aridity, under which traits associated with long leaf life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>, high hydraulic and thermal capacitances, and high potential rates of leaf water transport confer a competitive advantage.</p>

Global Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Hypertension Associated With Heart Failure and Preserved or Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We hypothesized that pulmonary venous hypertension in heart failure (HF) leads to predominate remodeling of pulmonary veins and that the severity of venous remodeling is associated with the severity of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with HF (n=108; 53 preserved and 55 reduced ejection fraction) with PH (HF-PH; pulmonary artery systolic pressure [PASP] ≥40 mm Hg) were compared to normal controls (n=12) and patients with primary pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD; n=17). In lung specimens from autopsy (control, HF-PH, and 7 PVOD) or surgery (10 PVOD), quantitative histomorphometry was performed in all analyzable arteries (n=4949), veins (n=7630), and small indeterminate vessels (IV; n=2168) to define percent medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (arteries) and percent intimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (%IT) (arteries, veins, and IV) relative to external <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average arterial percent medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (control, 6.9; HF-PH, 11.0; PVOD, 15.0), arterial %IT (control, 4.9; HF-PH, 14.9; PVOD, 31.1), venous %IT (control, 14.0; HF-PH, 24.9; PVOD, 43.9), and IV %IT (control, 10.6; HF-PH, 25.8; PVOD, 50.0) in HF-PH were higher than controls (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but lower than PVOD (<i>P</i>≤0.005 for all). PASP (mm Hg) was lower in HF-PH (median, 59 [interquartile range, 50–70]) than in PVOD (median, 91 [interquartile range, 82–103]). PASP correlated with arterial percent medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness (<i>r</i>=0.41) and arterial %IT (<i>r</i>=0.35) but more strongly with venous %IT (<i>r</i>=0.49) and IV %IT (<i>r</i>=0.55) (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all). Associations between PASP and venous or IV %IT remained significant after adjusting for arterial percent medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ness and %IT and did not vary by HF type. In patients with right heart catheterization (30 HF-PH, 14 PVOD), similar associations between the transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular remodeling existed, with numerically stronger associations for venous and IV %IT. Although the PASP was slightly higher in patients with HF-PH with right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary vascular remodeling was not more severe. Pulmonary vascular remodeling severity was associated with reductions in the diffusing capacity of the lungs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In HF, PH is associated with global pulmonary vascular remodeling, but the severity of PH correlates most strongly with venous and small IV intimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ening, similar to the pattern observed in PVOD. These findings expand our understanding of the pathobiology of PH in HF.</p></sec>

Relationship Between Lifelong Exercise Volume and Coronary Atherosclerosis in Athletes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of physical activity are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, there is debate on the dose-response relationship of exercise and cardiovascular disease outcomes and whether high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>es of exercise may accelerate coronary atherosclerosis. We aimed to determine the relationship between lifelong exercise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>es and coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Middle-aged men engaged in competitive or recreational leisure sports underwent a noncontrast and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan to assess coronary artery calcification (CAC) and plaque characteristics. Participants reported lifelong exercise history patterns. Exercise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>es were multiplied by metabolic equivalent of task (MET) scores to calculate MET-minutes per week. Participants’ activity was categorized as <1000, 1000 to 2000, or >2000 MET-min/wk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 284 men (age, 55±7 years) were included. CAC was present in 150 of 284 participants (53%) with a median CAC score of 35.8 (interquartile range, 9.3–145.8). Athletes with a lifelong exercise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e >2000 MET-min/wk (n=75) had a significantly higher CAC score (9.4 [interquartile range, 0–60.9] versus 0 [interquartile range, 0–43.5]; <i>P</i>=0.02) and prevalence of CAC (68%; adjusted odds ratio [OR<sub>adjusted</sub>]=3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6–6.6) and plaque (77%; OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=3.3; 95% CI, 1.6–7.1) compared with <1000 MET-min/wk (n=88; 43% and 56%, respectively). Very vigorous intensity exercise (≥9 MET) was associated with CAC (OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=1.47; 95% CI, 1.14–1.91) and plaque (OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=1.56; 95% CI, 1.17–2.08). Among participants with CAC>0, there was no difference in CAC score (<i>P</i>=0.20), area (<i>P</i>=0.21), density (<i>P</i>=0.25), and regions of interest (<i>P</i>=0.20) across exercise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e groups. Among participants with plaque, the most active group (>2000 MET-min/wk) had a lower prevalence of mixed plaques (48% versus 69%; OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=0.35; 95% CI, 0.15–0.85) and more often had only calcified plaques (38% versus 16%; OR<sub>adjusted</sub>=3.57; 95% CI, 1.28–9.97) compared with the least active group (<1000 MET-min/wk).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Participants in the >2000 MET-min/wk group had a higher prevalence of CAC and atherosclerotic plaques. The most active group, however, had a more benign composition of plaques, with fewer mixed plaques and more often only calcified plaques. These observations may explain the increased longevity typical of endurance athletes despite the presence of more coronary atherosclerotic plaque in the most active participants.</p></sec>

The Fluid Mechanics of Transcatheter Heart Valve Leaflet Thrombosis in the Neosinus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transcatheter heart valve (THV) thrombosis has been increasingly reported. In these studies, thrombus quantification has been based on a 2-dimensional assessment of a 3-dimensional phenomenon.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Postprocedural, 4-dimensional, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e-rendered CT data of patients with CoreValve, Evolut R, and SAPIEN 3 transcatheter aortic valve replacement enrolled in the RESOLVE study (Assessment of Transcatheter and Surgical Aortic Bioprosthetic Valve Dysfunction With Multimodality Imaging and Its Treatment with Anticoagulation) were included in this analysis. Patients on anticoagulation were excluded. SAPIEN 3 and CoreValve/Evolut R patients with and without hypoattenuated leaflet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ening were included to study differences between groups. Patients were classified as having THV thrombosis if there was any evidence of hypoattenuated leaflet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thick</span></strong>ening. Anatomic and THV deployment <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>es were analyzed, and thrombus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>es were computed through manual 3-dimensional reconstruction. We aimed to identify and evaluate risk factors that contribute to THV thrombosis through the combination of retrospective clinical data analysis and in vitro imaging in the space between the native and THV leaflets (neosinus).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAPIEN 3 valves with leaflet thrombosis were on average 10% further expanded (by <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">diamet</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er) than those without (95.5±5.2% versus 85.4±3.9%; <i>P</i><0.001). However, this relationship was not evident with the CoreValve/Evolut R. In CoreValve/Evolut Rs with thrombosis, the thrombus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volum</span></strong>e increased linearly with implant <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.7, <i>P</i><0.001). This finding was not seen in the SAPIEN 3. The in vitro analysis showed that a supraannular THV deployment resulted in a nearly 7-fold decrease in stagnation zone size (velocities <0.1 m/s) when compared with an intraannular deployment. In addition, the in vitro model indicated that the size of the stagnation zone increased as cardiac output decreased.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement thrombosis is a multifactorial process involving foreign materials, patient-specific blood chemistry, and complex flow patterns, our study indicates that deployed THV geometry may have implications on the occurrence of thrombosis. In addition, a supraannular neosinus may reduce thrombosis risk because of reduced flow stasis. Although additional prospective studies are needed to further develop strategies for minimizing thrombus burden, these results may help identify patients at higher thrombosis risk and aid in the development of next-generation devices with reduced thrombosis risk.</p></sec>

Drag, but not buoyancy, affects swim speed in captive Steller sea lions
<p>Swimming at an optimal speed is critical for breath-hold divers seeking to maximize the time they can spend foraging underwater. Theoretical studies have predicted that the optimal swim speed for an animal while transiting to and from <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> is independent of buoyancy, but is dependent on drag and metabolic rate. However, this prediction has never been experimentally tested. Our study assessed the effects of buoyancy and drag on the swim speed of three captive Steller sea lions (<i>Eumetopias jubatus</i>) that made 186 dives. Our study animals were trained to dive to feed at fixed <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s (10–50 m) under artificially controlled buoyancy and drag conditions. Buoyancy and drag were manipulated using a pair of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes attached to harnesses worn by the sea lions, and buoyancy conditions were <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ed to fall within the natural range of wild animals (∼12–26% subcutaneous fat). Drag conditions were changed with and without the PVC tubes, and swim speeds were recorded and compared during descent and ascent phases using an accelerometer attached to the harnesses. Generalized linear mixed-effect models with the animal as the random variable and five explanatory variables (body mass, buoyancy, dive <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>, dive phase, and drag) showed that swim speed was best predicted by two variables, drag and dive phase (AIC = −139). Consistent with a previous theoretical prediction, the results of our study suggest that the optimal swim speed of Steller sea lions is a function of drag, and is independent of dive <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">depth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> and buoyancy.</p>

DREADD technology posits the use of “<strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er receptors,” which are exclusively activated by the “<strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>er drug” clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Nevertheless, the in vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed. CNO does not enter the brain after systemic drug injections and shows low affinity for DREADDs. Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency. Upon systemic CNO injections, converted clozapine readily enters the brain and occupies central nervous system–expressed DREADDs, whereas systemic subthreshold clozapine injections induce preferential DREADD-mediated behaviors.</p>

We present <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> rules for constructing megadalton-scale DNA-protein hybrid shapes; introduce various structural motifs, such as custom curvature, corners, and vertices; and describe principles for creating multilayer DNA-protein objects with enhanced rigidity. We demonstrate self-assembly of our hybrid nanostructures in one-pot mixtures that include the genetic information for the <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">design</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ed proteins, the template DNA, RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and cofactors for transcription and translation.</p>

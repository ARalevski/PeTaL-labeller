Pinstatic Acid Promotes Auxin Transport by Inhibiting PIN Internalization
<p>Polar auxin transport plays a pivotal role in plant growth and development. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>-FORMED (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>) auxin efflux carriers regulate directional auxin movement by establishing local auxin maxima, minima, and gradients that drive multiple developmental processes and responses to environmental signals. Auxin has been proposed to modulate its own transport by regulating subcellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong> trafficking via processes such as clathrin-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong> endocytosis and constitutive recycling. Here, we further investigated the mechanisms by which auxin affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong> trafficking by screening auxin analogs and identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>static acid (PISA) as a positive modulator of polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). PISA had an auxin-like effect on hypocotyl elongation and adventitious root formation via positive regulation of auxin transport. PISA did not activate SCF<sup>TIR1/AFB</sup> signaling and yet induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong> accumulation at the cell surface by inhibiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong> internalization from the plasma membrane. This work demonstrates PISA to be a promising chemical tool to dissect the regulatory mechanisms behind subcellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong> trafficking and auxin transport.</p>

<i>PINOID</i> Is Required for Formation of the Stigma and Style in Rice
<p>The stigma is the entry point for sexual reproduction in plants, but the mechanisms underlying stigma development are largely unknown. Here, we disrupted putative auxin biosynthetic and signaling genes to evaluate their roles in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) development. Disruption of the rice <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>OID</i> (<i>OsPID</i>) gene completely eliminated the development of stigmas, and overexpression of <i>OsPID</i> led to overproliferation of stigmas, suggesting that <i>OsPID</i> is a key determinant for stigma development. Interestingly, <i>ospid</i> mutants did not display defects in flower initiation, nor did they develop any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>-like inflorescences, a characteristic phenotype observed in <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We constructed double mutants of <i>OsPID</i> and its closest homolog, <i>OsPIDb</i>, yet the double mutants still did not develop any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>-like inflorescences, indicating that either <i>ospid</i> is compensated by additional homologous genes or <i>OsPID</i> has different functions in rice compared with <i>PID</i> in other organisms. We then knocked out one of the <i>NAKED <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>S IN YUC MUTANTS</i> (<i>NPY</i>) genes, which cause the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>-like inflorescences in Arabidopsis when compromised, in the <i>ospid</i> background. The <i>ospid osnpy2</i> double mutants developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>-like inflorescences, which were phenotypically similar to <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis and maize, demonstrating that the roles of <i>OsPID</i> in inflorescence development are likely masked by redundant partners. This work identified a key determinant for stigma development in rice and revealed a complex picture of the <i>PID</i> gene in rice development. Furthermore, the stigma-less <i>ospid</i> mutants are potentially useful in producing hybrid rice.</p>

Mitochondrial Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Contributes to Auxin-Regulated Organ Development
<p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme (E1) of the PDH complex (PDC). This multienzyme complex contains E1, E2, and E3 components and controls the entry of carbon into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle to enable cellular energy production. The E1 component of the PDC is composed of an E1α catalytic subunit and an E1β regulatory subunit. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are two mitochondrial E1α homologs encoded by <i>IAA-CONJUGATE-RESISTANT 4</i> (<i>IAR4</i>) and <i>IAR4-LIKE</i> (<i>IAR4L</i>), and one mitochondrial E1β homolog. Although IAR4 was reported to be involved in auxin conjugate sensitivity and auxin homeostasis in root development, its precise role remains unknown. Here, we provide experimental evidence that mitochondrial PDC E1 contributes to polar auxin transport during organ development. We performed genetic screens for factors involved in cotyledon development and identified an uncharacterized mutant, <i>macchi-bou 1</i> (<i>mab1</i>). <i>MAB1</i> encodes a mitochondrial PDC E1β subunit that can form both a homodimer and a heterodimer with IAR4. The <i>mab1</i> mutation impaired MAB1 homodimerization, reduced the abundance of IAR4 and IAR4L, weakened PDC enzymatic activity, and diminished mitochondrial respiration. A metabolomics analysis showed significant changes in metabolites including amino acids in <i>mab1</i> and, in particular, identified an accumulation of Ala. These results suggest that MAB1 is a component of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial PDC E1. Furthermore, in <i>mab1</i> mutants and seedlings where the TCA cycle was pharmacologically blocked, we found reduced abundance of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers, possibly due to impaired PIN recycling and enhanced PIN degradation in vacuoles. Therefore, we suggest that <i>mab1</i> induces defective polar auxin transport via metabolic abnormalities.</p>

Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that span the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>

K63-linked polyubiquitin chains bind to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair
<p>Polyubiquitylation is canonically viewed as a posttranslational modification that governs protein stability or protein-protein interactions, in which distinct polyubiquitin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>es ultimately determine the fate of modified protein(s). We explored whether polyubiquitin chains have any nonprotein-related function. Using in vitro pull-down assays with synthetic materials, we found that polyubiquitin chains with the Lys<sup>63</sup> (K63) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e bound to DNA through a motif we called the “DNA-interacting patch” (DIP), which is composed of the adjacent residues Thr<sup>9</sup>, Lys<sup>11</sup>, and Glu<sup>34</sup>. Upon DNA damage, the binding of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains to DNA enhanced the recruitment of repair factors through their interaction with an Ile<sup>44</sup> patch in ubiquitin to facilitate DNA repair. Furthermore, experimental or cancer patient–derived mutations within the DIP impaired the DNA binding capacity of ubiquitin and subsequently attenuated K63-linked polyubiquitin chain accumulation at sites of DNA damage, thereby resulting in defective DNA repair and increased cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Our results therefore highlight a critical physiological role for K63-linked polyubiquitin chains in binding to DNA to facilitate DNA damage repair.</p>

Catastrophic Unbalanced Genome Rearrangements Cause Somatic Loss of Berry Color in Grapevine
<p>Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) color somatic variants that can be used to develop new grapevine cultivars occasionally appear associated with deletion events of uncertain origin. To understand the mutational mechanisms generating somatic structural variation in grapevine, we compared the Tempranillo Blanco (TB) white berry somatic variant with its black berry ancestor, Tempranillo Tinto. Whole-genome sequencing uncovered a catastrophic genome rearrangement in TB that caused the hemizygous deletion of 313 genes, including the loss of the functional copy for the <i>MYB</i> transcription factors required for anthocyanin pigmentation in the berry skin. Loss of heterozygosity and decreased copy number delimited interspersed monosomic and disomic regions in the right arm of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e groups 2 and 5. At least 11 validated clustered breakpoints involving intrachromosomal and interchromosomal translocations between three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e groups flanked the deleted fragments, which, according to segregation analyses, are phased in a single copy of each of the affected chromosomes. These hallmarks, along with the lack of homology between breakpoint joins and the randomness of the order and orientation of the rearranged fragments, are all consistent with a chromothripsis-like pattern generated after chromosome breakage and illegitimate rejoining. This unbalanced genome reshuffling has additional consequences in reproductive development. In TB, lack of sexual transmission of rearranged chromosomes associates with low gamete viability, which compromises fruit set and decreases fruit production. Our findings show that catastrophic genome rearrangements arise spontaneously and stabilize during plant somatic growth. These dramatic rearrangements generate new interesting phenotypes that can be selected for the improvement of vegetatively propagated plant species.</p>

Expansion of Secretin-Like G Protein-Coupled Receptors and Their Peptide Ligands via Local Duplications Before and After Two Rounds of Whole-Genome Duplication
<p>In humans, the secretin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family comprises 15 members with 18 corresponding peptide ligand genes. Although members have been identified in a large variety of vertebrate and nonvertebrate species, the origin and relationship of these proteins remain unresolved. To address this issue, we employed large-scale genome comparisons to identify genome fragments with conserved synteny and matched these fragments to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e groups in reconstructed early gnathostome ancestral chromosomes (<i>GAC</i>). This genome comparison revealed that most receptor and peptide genes were clustered in three <i>GAC</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e groups and suggested that the ancestral forms of five peptide subfamilies (corticotro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>-releasing hormone-like, calcitonin-like, parathyroid hormone-like, glucagon-like, and growth hormone-releasing hormone-like) and their cognate receptor families emerged through tandem local gene duplications before two rounds (2R) of whole-genome duplication. These subfamily genes have, then, been amplified by 2R whole-genome duplication, followed by additional local duplications and gene loss prior to the divergence of land vertebrates and teleosts. This study delineates a possible evolutionary scenario for whole secretin-like peptide and receptor family members and may shed light on evolutionary mechanisms for expansion of a gene family with a large number of paralogs.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p>Oil palm is the world’s leading source of vegetable oil and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of oil palm. The genome sequence of <i>Pisifera</i> is available whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been sequenced yet. We sequenced the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-sequenced 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome sequence of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the oil palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-sequencing of 17 additional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high genetic variation among palms from different geographical regions, but lower variation among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We mapped 10,000 SNPs on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e map of oil palm. In addition, high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the oil palms used in breeding populations of Southeast Asia, suggesting that LD map<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g is likely to be practical in this important oil crop. Our data provide a valuable resource for accelerating genetic improvement and studying the mechanism underlying phenotypic variations of important oil palm traits.</p>

Genome-Wide Development and Use of Microsatellite Markers for Large-Scale Genotyping Applications in Foxtail Millet [<i>Setaria italica</i> (L.)]
<p>The availability of well-validated informative co-dominant microsatellite markers and saturated genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e map has been limited in foxtail millet (<i>Setaria italica</i> L.). In view of this, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and identified 28 342 microsatellite repeat-motifs spanning 405.3 Mb of foxtail millet genome. The trinucleotide repeats (∼48%) was prevalent when compared with dinucleotide repeats (∼46%). Of the 28 342 microsatellites, 21 294 (∼75%) primer pairs were successfully designed, and a total of 15 573 markers were physically mapped on 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet. About 159 markers were validated successfully in 8 accessions of <i>Setaria</i> sp. with ∼67% polymorphic potential. The high percentage (89.3%) of cross-genera transferability across millet and non-millet species with higher transferability percentage in bioenergy grasses (∼79%, Switchgrass and ∼93%, Pearl millet) signifies their importance in studying the bioenergy grasses. <i>In silico</i> comparative map<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g of 15 573 foxtail millet microsatellite markers against the map<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g data of sorghum (16.9%), maize (14.5%) and rice (6.4%) indicated syntenic relationships among the chromosomes of foxtail millet and target species.

Integrated Consensus Map of Cultivated Peanut and Wild Relatives Reveals Structures of the A and B Genomes of <i>Arachis</i> and Divergence of the Legume Genomes

The aim of this study is to understand the genome structure of <i>Arachis</i> by develo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g a high-density integrated consensus map. Three recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses between the A genome diploid species, <i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis stenosperma</i>; the B genome diploid species, <i>Arachis ipaënsis</i> and <i>Arachis magna</i>; and between the AB genome tetraploids, <i>A. hypogaea</i> and an artificial amphidiploid (<i>A. ipaënsis</i> × <i>A. duranensis</i>)<sup>4×</sup>, were used to construct genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e maps: 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e groups (LGs) of 544 cM with 597 loci for the A genome; 10 LGs of 461 cM with 798 loci for the B genome; and 20 LGs of 1442 cM with 1469 loci for the AB genome. The resultant maps plus 13 published maps were integrated into a consensus map covering 2651 cM with 3693 marker loci which was anchored to 20 consensus LGs corresponding to the A and B genomes. The comparative genomics with genome sequences of <i>Cajanus cajan</i>, <i>Glycine max</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and <i>Medicago truncatula</i> revealed that the <i>Arachis</i> genome has segmented synteny relationship to the other legumes. The comparative maps in legumes, integrated tetraploid consensus maps, and genome-specific diploid maps will increase the genetic and genomic understanding of <i>Arachis</i> and should facilitate molecular breeding.</p>

Germline Loss-of-Function Mutations in EPHB4 Cause a Second Form of Capillary Malformation-Arteriovenous Malformation (CM-AVM2) Deregulating RAS-MAPK Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are localized and occur sporadically. However, they also can be multifocal in autosomal-dominant disorders, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and capillary malformation (CM)-AVM.

The dual frontier: Patented inventions and prior scientific advance
<p>The extent to which scientific advances support marketplace inventions is largely unknown. We study 4.8 million U.S. patents and 32 million research articles to determine the minimum citation distance between patented inventions and prior scientific advances. We find that most cited research articles (80%) link forward to a future patent. Similarly, most patents (61%) link backward to a prior research article. Linked papers and patents typically stand 2 to 4 degrees distant from the other domain. Yet, advances directly along the patent-paper boundary are notably more impactful within their own domains. The distance metric further provides a typology of the fields, institutions, and individuals involved in science-to-technology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>es. Overall, the findings are consistent with theories that emphasize substantial and fruitful connections between patenting and prior scientific inquiry.</p>

Sparse lens materials form via low-valence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>es between disordered loops protruding from the protein surface. The loops are polydisperse and bind via a set of hydrogen bonds between disordered side chains. Peripheral lens regions with low particle valence form stable, volume-spanning gels at low density, whereas central regions with higher average valence gel at higher densities. The proteins demonstrate an evolved set of linkers for self-assembly of nanoparticles into volumetric materials.</p>

Atomic structure of the human cytomegalovirus capsid with its securing tegument layer of pp150
<p>Herpesviruses possess a genome-pressurized capsid. The 235-kilobase genome of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is by far the largest of any herpesvirus, yet it has been unclear how its capsid, which is similar in size to those of other herpesviruses, is stabilized. Here we report a HCMV atomic structure consisting of the herpesvirus-conserved capsid proteins MCP, Tri1, Tri2, and SCP and the HCMV-specific tegument protein pp150—totaling ~4000 molecules and 62 different conformers. MCPs manifest as a complex of insertions around a bacteriophage HK97 gp5–like domain, which gives rise to three classes of capsid floor–defining interactions; triplexes, composed of two “embracing” Tri2 conformers and a “third-wheeling” Tri1, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fasten</span></strong> the capsid floor. HCMV-specific strategies include using hexon channels to accommodate the genome and pp150 helix bundles to secure the capsid via cysteine tetrad–to-SCP interactions. Our structure should inform rational design of countermeasures against HCMV, other herpesviruses, and even HIV/AIDS.</p>

Negative selection in humans and fruit flies involves synergistic epistasis
<p>Negative selection against deleterious alleles produced by mutation influences within-population variation as the most pervasive form of natural selection. However, it is not known whether deleterious alleles affect fitness independently, so that cumulative fitness loss depends exponentially on the number of deleterious alleles, or synergistically, so that each additional deleterious allele results in a larger decrease in relative fitness. Negative selection with synergistic epistasis should produce negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e disequilibrium between deleterious alleles and, therefore, an underdispersed distribution of the number of deleterious alleles in the genome. Indeed, we detected underdispersion of the number of rare loss-of-function alleles in eight independent data sets from human and fly populations. Thus, selection against rare protein-disrupting alleles is characterized by synergistic epistasis, which may explain how human and fly populations persist despite high genomic mutation rates.</p>

The applied value of public investments in biomedical research

We find that about 10% of NIH grants generate a patent directly but 30% generate articles that are subsequently cited by patents. Although policy-makers often focus on direct patenting by academic scientists, the bulk of the effect of NIH research on patenting appears to be indirect. We also find no systematic relationship between the “basic” versus “applied” research focus of a grant and its propensity to be cited by a patent.</p>

Improving election prediction internationally
<p>This study reports the results of a multiyear program to predict direct executive elections in a variety of countries from globally pooled data. We developed prediction models by means of an election data set covering 86 countries and more than 500 elections, and a separate data set with extensive polling data from 146 election rounds. We also participated in two live forecasting experiments. Our models correctly predicted 80 to 90% of elections in out-of-sample tests. The results suggest that global elections can be successfully modeled and that they are likely to become more predictable as more information becomes available in future elections. The results provide strong evidence for the impact of political institutions and incumbent advantage. They also provide evidence to support contentions about the importance of international <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e and aid. Direct evidence for economic indicators as predictors of election outcomes is relatively weak. The results suggest that, with some adjustments, global polling is a robust predictor of election outcomes, even in develo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g states. Implications of these findings after the latest U.S. presidential election are discussed.</p>

Distortion of histone octamer core promotes nucleosome mobilization by a chromatin remodeler
<p>Adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes play essential biological roles by mobilizing nucleosomal DNA. Yet, how DNA is mobilized despite the steric constraints placed by the histone octamer remains unknown. Using methyl transverse relaxation–optimized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on a 450-kilodalton complex, we show that the chromatin remodeler, SNF2h, distorts the histone octamer. Binding of SNF2h in an activated ATP state changes the dynamics of buried histone residues. Preventing octamer distortion by site-specific disulfide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>es inhibits nucleosome sliding by SNF2h while promoting octamer eviction by the SWI-SNF complex, RSC. Our findings indicate that the histone core of a nucleosome is more plastic than previously imagined and that octamer deformation plays different roles based on the type of chromatin remodeler. Octamer plasticity may contribute to chromatin regulation beyond ATP-dependent remodeling.</p>

Mass seasonal bioflows of high-flying insect migrants
<p>Migrating animals have an impact on ecosystems directly via influxes of predators, prey, and competitors and indirectly by vectoring nutrients, energy, and pathogens. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>es between vertebrate movements and ecosystem processes have been established, the effects of mass insect “bioflows” have not been described. We quantified biomass flux over the southern United Kingdom for high-flying (>150 meters) insects and show that ~3.5 trillion insects (3200 tons of biomass) migrate above the region annually. These flows are not randomly directed in insects larger than 10 milligrams, which exploit seasonally beneficial tailwinds. Large seasonal differences in the southward versus northward transfer of biomass occur in some years, although flows were balanced over the 10-year period. Our long-term study reveals a major transport process with implications for ecosystem services, processes, and biogeochemistry.</p>

Formaldehyde stabilization facilitates lignin monomer production during biomass depolymerization
<p>Practical, high-yield lignin depolymerization methods could greatly increase biorefinery productivity and profitability. However, development of these methods is limited by the presence of interunit carbon-carbon bonds within native lignin, and further by formation of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>es during lignin extraction. We report that adding formaldehyde during biomass pretreatment produces a soluble lignin fraction that can be converted to guaiacyl and syringyl monomers at near theoretical yields during subsequent hydrogenolysis (47 mole % of Klason lignin for beech and 78 mole % for a high-syringyl transgenic poplar). These yields were three to seven times those obtained without formaldehyde, which prevented lignin condensation by forming 1,3-dioxane structures with lignin side-chain hydroxyl groups. By depolymerizing cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin separately, monomer yields were between 76 and 90 mole % for these three major biomass fractions.</p>

Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse polar behaviors in response to directional and nondirectional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic behaviors is well understood, but it is less well understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the polarity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally programmed polarity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>OID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in polarization of the auxin transporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf polarity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and polar transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental sha<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g of polar auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental programming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

OsPINOID Regulates Stigma and Ovule Initiation through Maintenance of the Floral Meristem by Auxin Signaling
<p>Stigma and ovule initiation is essential for sexual reproduction in flowering plants. However, the mechanism underlying the initiation of stigma and ovule primordia remains elusive. We identified a stigma-less mutant of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and revealed that it was caused by the mutation in the <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>OID</i> (<i>OsPID</i>) gene. Unlike the <i>pid</i> mutant that shows typical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>-like inflorescences in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the <i>ospid</i> mutant does not display any defects in inflorescence development and flower initiation, and fails to develop normal ovules in most spikelets. The auxin activity in the young pistil of <i>ospid</i> was lower than that in the wild-type pistil. Furthermore, the expression of most auxin response factor genes was down-regulated, and <i>OsETTIN1</i>, <i>OsETTIN2</i>, and <i>OsMONOPTEROS</i> lost their rearrangements of expression patterns during pistil and stamen primordia development in <i>ospid</i>. Moreover, the transcription of the floral meristem marker gene, <i>OSH1</i>, was down-regulated and <i>FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4</i>, the putative ortholog of Arabidopsis <i>CLAVATA3</i>, was up-regulated in the pistil primordium of <i>ospid</i>. These results suggested that the meristem proliferation in the pistil primordium might be arrested prematurely in <i>ospid</i>. Based on these results, we propose that the OsPID-mediated auxin signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of rice stigma and ovule initiation by maintaining the floral meristem.</p>

Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p>Auxin controls body plan patterning in land plants and has been proposed to play a similar role in the development of brown algae (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with land plants. The mechanism of auxin action in brown algae remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model system to show that auxin plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown algae. Indole-3-acetic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally develop a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meristem from the other, addition of exogenous auxins to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo developed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when variable extrinsic informational cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an inhibitor of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of transporters in land plants, affected rhizoid formation by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of auxin genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and transport genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) transporters from land plants have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>. Together with reports on auxin function in basal lineages of green algae, these results suggest that auxin function predates the divergence between the green and brown lineage and the transition toward land plants.</p>

A Trihelix Family Transcription Factor Is Associated with Key Genes in Mixed-Linkage Glucan Accumulation
<p>Mixed-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e glucan (MLG) is a polysaccharide that is highly abundant in grass endosperm cell walls and present at lower amounts in other tissues. <i>Cellulose synthase-like F</i> (<i>CSLF</i>) and <i>cellulose synthase-like H</i> genes synthesize MLG, but it is unknown if other genes participate in the production and restructuring of MLG. Using <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> transcriptional profiling data, we identified a <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> trihelix family transcription factor (<i>BdTHX1</i>) that is highly coexpressed with the <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon CSLF6</i> gene (<i>BdCSLF6</i>), which suggests that BdTHX1 is involved in the regulation of MLG biosynthesis. To determine the genes regulated by this transcription factor, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments using immature <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> seeds and an anti-BdTHX1 polyclonal antibody. The ChIP-seq experiment identified the second intron of <i>BdCSLF6</i> as one of the most enriched sequences. The binding of BdTHX1 to the <i>BdCSLF6</i> intron sequence was confirmed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). ChIP-seq also showed that a gene encoding a grass-specific glycoside hydrolase family 16 endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (<i>BdXTH8</i>) is bound by BdTHX1, and the binding was confirmed by EMSA. Radiochemical transglucanase assays showed that BdXTH8 exhibits predominantly MLG:xyloglucan endotransglucosylase activity, a hetero-transglycosylation reaction, and can thus produce MLG-xyloglucan covalent bonds; it also has a lower xyloglucan:xyloglucan endotransglucosylase activity. <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> shoots regenerated from transformed calli overexpressing <i>BdTHX1</i> showed an abnormal arrangement of vascular tissue and seedling-lethal phenotypes. These results indicate that the transcription factor BdTHX1 likely plays an important role in MLG biosynthesis and restructuring by regulating the expression of <i>BdCSLF6</i> and <i>BdXTH8</i>.</p>

Root Gravitropism Is Regulated by a Crosstalk between <i>para</i>-Aminobenzoic Acid, Ethylene, and Auxin
<p>Plants respond to gravitational force through directional growth along the gravity vector. Although auxin is the central component of the root graviresponse, it works in concert with other plant hormones. Here, we show that the folate precursor <i>para</i>-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a key modulator of the auxin-ethylene interplay during root gravitropism in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In gravistimulated roots, PABA promotes an asymmetric auxin response, which causes the asymmetric growth responsible for root curvature. This activity requires the auxin response transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 as well as ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, indicating that PABA activity requires both auxin and ethylene pathways. Similar to ethylene, exogenous PABA reverses the agravitropic root growth of the auxin transport mutant <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>-formed2</i> (<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>2</i>) and the auxin biosynthetic double mutant with loss of function of <i>weak ethylene insensitive</i> (<i>wei</i>) genes, <i>wei8wei2</i>, but not the <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>2wei8wei2</i> triple mutant. This finding suggests that PABA regulates the ethylene-dependent reciprocal compensation between auxin transport and biosynthesis. Furthermore, manipulation of endogenous free PABA levels by modulating the expression of the gene encoding its glucosylation enzyme, UDP-GLYCOSYL TRANSFERASE75B1, impacts the root graviresponse, suggesting that endogenous free PABA levels may play a crucial role in modulating the auxin-ethylene cross talk necessary for root gravitropism.</p>

Metabolome Analysis of Multi-Connected Biparental Chromosome Segment Substitution Line Populations
<p>Metabolomic analysis coupled with advanced genetic populations represents a powerful tool with which to investigate the plant metabolome. However, genetic analyses of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) metabolome have been conducted mainly using natural accessions or a single biparental population. Here, the flag leaves from three interconnected chromosome segment substitution line populations with a common recurrent genetic background were used to dissect rice metabolic diversity. We effectively used multiple interconnected biparental populations, constructed by introducing genomic segments into Zhenshan 97 from ACC10 (A/Z), Minghui 63 (M/Z), and Nipponbare (N/Z), to map metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTL). A total of 1,587 mQTL were generated, of which 684, 479, and 722 were obtained from the A/Z, M/Z, and N/Z chromosome segment substitution line populations, respectively, and we designated 99 candidate genes for 367 mQTL. In addition, 1,001 mQTL were generated specifically from joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e analysis with 25 candidate genes assigned. Several of these candidates were validated, such as <i>LOC_Os07g01020</i> for the in vivo content of pyridoxine and its derivative and <i>LOC_Os04g25980</i> for cis-zeatin glucosyltransferase activity. We propose a novel biosynthetic pathway for <i>O</i>-methylapigenin <i>C</i>-pentoside and demonstrated that <i>LOC_Os04g11970</i> encodes a component of this pathway through fine-map<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g. We postulate that the methylated apigenin may confer plant disease resistance. This study demonstrates the power of using multiple interconnected populations to generate a large number of veritable mQTL. The combined results are discussed in the context of functional metabolomics and the possible features of assigned candidates underlying respective metabolites.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p>Plant growth and water use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving plant water use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance agricultural sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenoty<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g platform to quantify plant size and water use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-watered and water-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of plant size and water use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of plant size given water use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing plant size, water use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil water availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of plant WUE under different watering treatments. Linkage map<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>-formed2</i> [<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>2-based polar auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

Cytokinin Targets Auxin Transport to Promote Shoot Branching
<p>Cytokinin promotes shoot branching by activating axillary buds, but its mechanism of action in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in this process is unclear. We have shown previously that a hextuple mutant lacking a clade of type-A Arabidopsis Response Regulators (ARRs) known to act in cytokinin signaling has reduced shoot branching compared with the wild type. Since these proteins typically act as negative regulators of cytokinin signaling, this is an unexpected result. To explore this paradox more deeply, we characterized the effects of loss of function of the type-B ARR, ARR1, which positively regulates cytokinin-induced gene expression. The <i>arr1</i> mutant has increased branching, consistent with a role antagonistic to the type-A ARRs but in apparent conflict with the known positive role for cytokinin in bud activation. We show that the <i>arr</i> branching phenotypes correlate with increases in stem auxin transport and steady-state levels of the auxin export proteins PIN3 and PIN7 on the plasma membrane of xylem-associated cells in the main stem. Cytokinin treatment results in an increased accumulation of PIN3, PIN7, and the closely related PIN4 within several hours, and loss of <i>PIN3</i>, <i>PIN4</i>, and <i>PIN7</i> can partially rescue the <i>arr1</i> branching phenotype. This suggests that there are multiple signaling pathways for cytokinin in bud outgrowth; one of these pathways regulates PIN proteins in shoots, independently of the canonical signaling function of the <i>ARR</i> genes tested here. A hypothesis consistent with the <i>arr</i> shoot phenotypes is that feedback control of biosynthesis leads to altered cytokinin accumulation, driving cytokinin signaling via this pathway.</p>

PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our perception of the functional impacts of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the biological significance of the observed DEGs using established biological concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on biological processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA.

The sHSP22 Heat Shock Protein Requires the ABI1 Protein Phosphatase to Modulate Polar Auxin Transport and Downstream Responses
<p>The phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) response pathways interact synergistically or antagonistically to regulate plant development and environmental adaptation. Here, we show that <i>ABI1</i>, a key negative regulator of ABA signaling, is essential for auxin-modulated root development. We performed a microarray analysis using the loss-of-function mutant <i>abi1-3</i> and Col-0 seedlings treated with IAA. For <i>sHSP22</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) small heat shock protein-encoding gene, the induction by IAA was dependent on <i>ABI1</i>. <i>shsp22</i> displayed enhanced sensitivity to ABA in primary root growth. In contrast, overexpression of full-length, but not truncated sHSP22 lacking signal peptide and ER-retention sequences, resulted in decreased ABA sensitivity. Overexpressed (OX) <i>sHSP22</i> partially rescued the ABA hypersensitivity of <i>abi1-3</i>. In addition, <i>sHSP22</i> is involved in auxin-regulated hypocotyl elongation at high temperature treatment. <i>sHSP22</i> also affected accumulation of auxin efflux carrier PIN proteins due to potentiated intracellular trafficking. And <i>sHSP22 OX</i> lines initiated more lateral roots after auxin application. Our results suggest that sHSP22 regulates auxin response through modulating auxin polar transport, and ABI1-sHSP22 provides a novel module orchestrating ABA and auxin signaling crosstalk in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Thioredoxin-Mediated ROS Homeostasis Explains Natural Variation in Plant Regeneration
<p>Plant regeneration is fundamental to basic research and agricultural applications. The regeneration capacity of plants varies largely in different genotypes, but the reason for this variation remains elusive. Here, we identified a novel thioredoxin DCC1 in determining the capacity of shoot regeneration among Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural variation. Loss of function of <i>DCC1</i> resulted in inhibited shoot regeneration. <i>DCC1</i> was expressed mainly in the inner tissues of the callus and encoded a functional thioredoxin that was localized in the mitochondria. DCC1 protein interacted directly with CARBONIC ANHYDRASE2 (CA2), which is an essential subunit of the respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase complex (Complex I). DCC1 regulated Complex I activity via redox modification of CA2 protein. Mutation of <i>DCC1</i> or <i>CA2</i> led to reduced Complex I activity and triggered mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The increased ROS level regulated shoot regeneration by repressing expression of the genes involved in multiple pathways. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e disequilibrium analysis indicated that DCC1 was a major determinant of the natural variation in shoot regeneration among Arabidopsis ecotypes. Thus, our study uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism by which thioredoxin-dependent redox modification regulates de novo shoot initiation via the modulation of ROS homeostasis and provides new insights into improving the capacity of plant regeneration.</p>

RopGEF1 Plays a Critical Role in Polar Auxin Transport in Early Development
<p>Polar auxin transport, facilitated by the combined activities of auxin influx and efflux carriers to maintain asymmetric auxin distribution, is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>RopGEF1</i>, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs), is critically involved in polar distribution of auxin influx carrier AUX1 and differential accumulation of efflux carriers PIN7 and PIN2 and is important for embryo and early seedling development when RopGEF1 is prevalently expressed. Knockdown or knockout of <i>RopGEF1</i> induces embryo defects, cotyledon vein breaks, and delayed root gravity responses. Altered expression from the auxin response reporter <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in the root pole of <i>RopGEF1</i>-deficient embryos and loss of asymmetric distribution of <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in their gravistimulated root tips suggest that auxin distribution is affected in <i>ropgef1</i> mutants. This is reflected by the polarity of AUX1 being altered in <i>ropgef1</i> embryos and roots, shifting from the normal apical membrane location to a basal location in embryo central vascular and root protophloem cells and also reduced PIN7 accumulation at embryos and altered PIN2 distribution in gravistimulated roots of mutant seedlings. In establishing that RopGEF1 is critical for AUX1 localization and PIN differential accumulation, our results reveal a role for RopGEF1 in cell polarity and polar auxin transport whereby it imapcts auxin-mediated plant growth and development.</p>

Synthesis and Self-Assembly of Cellulose Microfibrils from Reconstituted Cellulose Synthase
<p>Cellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, can be converted to bioethanol and is thus highly studied. In plants, cellulose is produced by cellulose synthase, a processive family-2 glycosyltransferase. In plant cell walls, individual β-1,4-glucan chains polymerized by CesA are assembled into microfibrils that are frequently bundled into macrofibrils. An in vitro system in which cellulose is synthesized and assembled into fibrils would facilitate detailed study of this process. Here, we report the heterologous expression and partial purification of His-tagged CesA5 from <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Immunoblot analysis and mass spectrometry confirmed enrichment of PpCesA5. The recombinant protein was functional when reconstituted into liposomes made from yeast total lipid extract. The functional studies included incorporation of radiolabeled Glc, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e analysis, and imaging of cellulose microfibril formation using transmission electron microscopy. Several microfibrils were observed either inside or on the outer surface of proteoliposomes, and strikingly, several thinner fibrils formed ordered bundles that either covered the surfaces of proteoliposomes or were spawned from liposome surfaces. We also report this arrangement of fibrils made by proteoliposomes bearing CesA8 from hybrid aspen. These observations describe minimal systems of membrane-reconstituted CesAs that polymerize β-1,4-glucan chains that coalesce to form microfibrils and higher-ordered macrofibrils. How these micro- and macrofibrils relate to those found in primary and secondary plant cell walls is uncertain, but their presence enables further study of the mechanisms that govern the formation and assembly of fibrillar cellulosic structures and cell wall composites during or after the polymerization process controlled by CesA proteins.</p>

Monophyletic Origin and Evolution of the Largest Crucifer Genomes
<p>Clade E, or the <i>Hesperis</i> clade, is one of the major Brassicaceae (Crucifereae) clades, comprising some 48 genera and 351 species classified into seven tribes and is distributed predominantly across arid and montane regions of Asia. Several taxa have socioeconomic significance, being important ornamental but also weedy and invasive species. From the comparative genomic perspective, the clade is noteworthy as it harbors species with the largest crucifer genomes but low numbers of chromosomes (<i>n</i> = 5–7). By applying comparative cytogenetic analysis and whole-chloroplast phylogenetics, we constructed, to our knowledge, the first partial and complete cytogenetic maps for selected representatives of clade E tribes and investigated their relationships in a family-wide context. The <i>Hesperis</i> clade is a well-supported monophyletic lineage comprising seven tribes: Anchonieae, Buniadeae, Chorisporeae, Dontostemoneae, Euclidieae, Hesperideae, and Shehbazieae. The clade diverged from other Brassicaceae crown-group clades during the Oligocene, followed by subsequent Miocene tribal diversifications in central/southwestern Asia. The inferred ancestral karyotype of clade E (CEK; <i>n</i> = 7) originated from an older <i>n</i> = 8 genome, which also was the purported progenitor of tribe Arabideae (KAA genome). In most taxa of clade E, the seven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e groups of CEK either remained conserved (Chorisporeae) or were reshuffled by chromosomal translocations (Euclidieae). In 50% of Anchonieae and Hesperideae species, the CEK genome has undergone descending dysploidy toward <i>n</i> = 6 (−5). These genomic data elucidate early genome evolution in Brassicaceae and pave the way for future whole-genome sequencing and assembly efforts in this as yet genomically neglected group of crucifer plants.</p>

<p>Daurichromenic acid (DCA) synthase catalyzes the oxidative cyclization of grifolic acid to produce DCA, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid isolated from <i>Rhododendron dauricum</i>. We identified a novel cDNA encoding DCA synthase by transcriptome-based screening from young leaves of <i>R. dauricum</i>. The gene coded for a 533-amino acid polypeptide with moderate homologies to flavin adenine dinucleotide oxidases from other plants. The primary structure contained an amino-terminal signal peptide and conserved amino acid residues to form bicovalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e to the flavin adenine dinucleotide isoalloxazine ring at histidine-112 and cysteine-175. In addition, the recombinant DCA synthase, purified from the culture supernatant of transgenic <i>Pichia pastoris</i>, exhibited structural and functional properties as a flavoprotein. The reaction mechanism of DCA synthase characterized herein partly shares a similarity with those of cannabinoid synthases from <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, whereas DCA synthase catalyzes a novel cyclization reaction of the farnesyl moiety of a meroterpenoid natural product of plant origin. Moreover, in this study, we present evidence that DCA is biosynthesized and accumulated specifically in the glandular scales, on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants, based on various analytical studies at the chemical, biochemical, and molecular levels. The extracellular localization of DCA also was confirmed by a confocal microscopic analysis of its autofluorescence. These data highlight the unique feature of DCA: the final step of biosynthesis is completed in apoplastic space, and it is highly accumulated outside the scale cells.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under control and water-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with control conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under control conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (control), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e disequilibrium blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping and QTL Mapping Reveals the Genetic Architecture of Maize Plant Growth
<p>With increasing demand for novel traits in crop breeding, the plant research community faces the challenge of quantitatively analyzing the structure and function of large numbers of plants. A clear goal of high-throughput phenoty<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g is to bridge the gap between genomics and phenomics. In this study, we quantified 106 traits from a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) recombinant inbred line population (<i>n</i> = 167) across 16 developmental stages using the automatic phenoty<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g platform. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) map<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g with a high-density genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e map, including 2,496 recombinant bins, was used to uncover the genetic basis of these complex agronomic traits, and 988 QTLs have been identified for all investigated traits, including three QTL hotspots. Biomass accumulation and final yield were predicted using a combination of dissected traits in the early growth stage. These results reveal the dynamic genetic architecture of maize plant growth and enhance ideotype-based maize breeding and prediction.</p>

VPS36-Dependent Multivesicular Bodies Are Critical for Plasmamembrane Protein Turnover and Vacuolar Biogenesis
<p>Most eukaryotic cells target ubiquitinated plasma membrane (PM) proteins for vacuolar degradation in response to environmental and developmental cues. This process involves endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT). However, little is known about the cellular mechanisms of ESCRTs in plants. Here, we studied the function of one ESCRT-II component, VPS36, which shows ubiquitin-binding activity and may form a putative ESCRT-II with VPS22 and VPS25 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Recessive mutation of the ubiquitously expressed <i>VPS36</i> causes multiple defects, including delayed embryogenesis, defective root elongation, and limited expansion of cotyledons, and these effects can be complemented by its genomic DNA. Abnormal intracellular compartments containing several membrane transporters, including members of the PIN-FORMEDs, AUXIN RESISTANT 1, and PIP1 families, were found in <i>vps36-1</i> plants. Employing a genetic approach to cross <i>vps36-1/+</i> with transgenic plants harboring various fluorescent protein-tagged organelle markers, as well as fluorescent probe and ultrastructural approaches, revealed PM proteins in microsomal fractions from <i>vps36-1</i> seedlings and demonstrated that VPS36 is critical for forming multivesicular bodies and vacuolar biogenesis for protein degradation. Our study shows that functional VPS36 is essential for a proper endosomal sorting pathway and for vacuolar biogenesis in Arabidopsis.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>Brachypodium</i> Links Vernalization and Flowering Time Loci as Major Flowering Determinants
<p>The domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favorable developmental traits, including flowering time, which resulted in the creation of varieties with altered growth habits. Research into the pathways underlying these growth habits in cereals has highlighted the role of three main flowering regulators: <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>VRN1</i>), <i>VRN2</i>, and <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>). Previous reverse genetic studies suggested that the roles of <i>VRN1</i> and <i>FT</i> are conserved in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> yet identified considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of <i>VRN2</i>. To investigate the natural diversity governing flowering time pathways in a nondomesticated grass, the reference <i>B. distachyon</i> accession Bd21 was crossed with the vernalization-dependent accession ABR6. Resequencing of ABR6 allowed the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic map at the F4 stage of the map<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g population. Flowering time was evaluated in F4:5 families in five environmental conditions, and three major loci were found to govern flowering time. Interestingly, two of these loci colocalize with the <i>B. distachyon</i> homologs of the major flowering pathway genes <i>VRN2</i> and <i>FT</i>, whereas no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e was observed at <i>VRN1</i>. Characterization of these candidates identified sequence and expression variation between the two parental genotypes, which may explain the contrasting growth habits. However, the identification of additional quantitative trait loci suggests that greater complexity underlies flowering time in this nondomesticated system. Studying the interaction of these regulators in <i>B. distachyon</i> provides insights into the evolutionary context of flowering time regulation in the Poaceae as well as elucidates the way humans have utilized the natural variation present in grasses to create modern temperate cereals.</p>

The Genetics of Leaf Flecking in Maize and Its Relationship to Plant Defense and Disease Resistance
<p>Physiological leaf spotting, or flecking, is a mild-lesion phenotype observed on the leaves of several commonly used maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines and has been anecdotally linked to enhanced broad-spectrum disease resistance. Flecking was assessed in the maize nested association map<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pin</span></strong>g (NAM) population, comprising 4,998 recombinant inbred lines from 25 biparental families, and in an association population, comprising 279 diverse maize inbreds. Joint family <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e analysis was conducted with 7,386 markers in the NAM population. Genome-wide association tests were performed with 26.5 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NAM population and with 246,497 SNPs in the association population, resulting in the identification of 18 and three loci associated with variation in flecking, respectively. Many of the candidate genes colocalizing with associated SNPs are similar to genes that function in plant defense response via cell wall modification, salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-dependent pathways, redox homeostasis, stress response, and vesicle trafficking/remodeling. Significant positive correlations were found between increased flecking, stronger defense response, increased disease resistance, and increased pest resistance. A nonlinear relationship with total kernel weight also was observed whereby lines with relatively high levels of flecking had, on average, lower total kernel weight. We present evidence suggesting that mild flecking could be used as a selection criterion for breeding programs trying to incorporate broad-spectrum disease resistance.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Male–Female Sexual Dimorphism Predates the Gender-Based Divergence of the Mating Locus Gene <i>MAT3/RB</i>
<p>The molecular bases for the evolution of male–female sexual dimorphism are possible to study in volvocine algae because they encompass the entire range of reproductive morphologies from isogamy to oogamy. In 1978, Charlesworth suggested the model of a gamete size gene becoming linked to the sex-determining or mating type locus (<i>MT</i>) as a mechanism for the evolution of anisogamy. Here, we carried out the first comprehensive study of a candidate <i>MT-</i>linked oogamy gene, <i>MAT3/RB</i>, across the volvocine lineage. We found that evolution of anisogamy/oogamy predates the extremely high male–female divergence of <i>MAT3</i> that characterizes the <i>Volvox carteri</i> lineage. These data demonstrate very little sex-linked sequence divergence of <i>MAT3</i> between the two sexes in other volvocine groups, though <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e between <i>MAT3</i> and the mating locus appears to be conserved. These data implicate genetic determinants other than or in addition to <i>MAT3</i> in the evolution of anisogamy in volvocine algae.</p>

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease was obtained through a hospital discharge registry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linkag</span></strong>e. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart disease, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

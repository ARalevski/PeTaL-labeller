[C <sc>ii</sc>] 158-μm emission from the host galaxies of damped Lyman-alpha systems
<p>Gas surrounding high-redshift <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es has been studied through observations of absorption line systems toward background quasars for decades. However, it has proven difficult to identify and characterize the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es associated with these absorbers due to the intrinsic faintness of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es compared with the quasars at optical wavelengths. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, we report on detections of [C <sc>ii</sc>] 158-μm line and dust-continuum emission from two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es associated with two such absorbers at a redshift of <i>z</i> ~ 4. Our results indicate that the hosts of these high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>licity absorbers have physical properties similar to massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es and are embedded in enriched neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> gas reservoirs that extend well beyond the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-forming interstellar medium of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> becomes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the atomic density. The properties are those of an atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington dissociative transition to atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> in the laboratory.</p>

Fast molecular outflow from a dusty star-forming galaxy in the early Universe
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es grow inefficiently, with only a small percentage of the available gas converted into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s each free-fall time. Feedback processes, such as outflowing winds driven by radiation pressure, supernovae, or supermassive black hole accretion, can act to halt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation if they heat or expel the gas supply. We report a molecular outflow launched from a dust-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-forming galaxy at redshift 5.3, 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The outflow reaches velocities up to 800 kilometers per second relative to the galaxy, is resolved into multiple clumps, and carries mass at a rate within a factor of 2 of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation rate. Our results show that molecular outflows can remove a large fraction of the gas available for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es at high redshift.</p>

Synthesis of FeH<sub>5</sub>: A layered structure with atomic hydrogen slabs

Molecular gas in the halo fuels the growth of a massive cluster galaxy at high redshift
<p>The largest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es in the universe reside in galaxy clusters. Using sensitive observations of carbon monoxide, we show that the Spiderweb galaxy—a massive galaxy in a distant protocluster—is forming from a large reservoir of molecular gas. Most of this molecular gas lies between the protocluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es and has low velocity dispersion, indicating that it is part of an enriched intergalactic medium. This may constitute the reservoir of gas that fuels the widespread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation seen in earlier ultraviolet observations of the Spiderweb galaxy. Our results support the notion that giant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es in clusters formed from extended regions of recycled gas at high redshift.</p>

These   patients all had one measurement of the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluation)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluation).

Photochemical Route for Accessing Amorphous Metal Oxide Materials for Water Oxidation Catalysis

Heavy Metals Induce Iron Deficiency Responses at Different Hierarchic and Regulatory Levels
<p>In plants, the excess of several heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s mimics iron (Fe) deficiency-induced chlorosis, indicating a disturbance in Fe homeostasis. To examine the level at which heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s interfere with Fe deficiency responses, we carried out an in-depth characterization of Fe-related physiological, regulatory, and morphological responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exposed to heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s. Enhanced zinc (Zn) uptake closely mimicked Fe deficiency by leading to low chlorophyll but high ferric-chelate reductase activity and coumarin release. These responses were not caused by Zn-inhibited Fe uptake via IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER (IRT1). Instead, Zn simulated the transcriptional response of typical Fe-regulated genes, indicating that Zn affects Fe homeostasis at the level of Fe sensing. Excess supplies of cobalt and nickel altered root traits in a different way from Fe deficiency, inducing only transient Fe deficiency responses, which were characterized by a lack of induction of the ethylene pathway. Cadmium showed a rather inconsistent influence on Fe deficiency responses at multiple levels. By contrast, manganese evoked weak Fe deficiency responses in wild-type plants but strongly exacerbated chlorosis in <i>irt1</i> plants, indicating that manganese antagonized Fe mainly at the level of transport. These results show that the investigated heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s modulate Fe deficiency responses at different hierarchic and regulatory levels and that the interaction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s with physiological and morphological Fe deficiency responses is uncoupled. Thus, this study not only emphasizes the importance of assessing heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> toxicities at multiple levels but also provides a new perspective on how Fe deficiency contributes to the toxic action of individual heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) proteins play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ protein transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ protein expression patterns and transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ protein transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ protein mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of several TJ proteins significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ proteins in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ proteins in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Cells alter their tRNA abundance to selectively regulate protein synthesis during stress conditions
<p>Decoding the information in mRNA during protein synthesis relies on tRNA adaptors, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of which can affect the decoding rate and translation efficiency. To determine whether cells alter tRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance to selectively regulate protein expression, we quantified changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of individual tRNAs at different time points in response to diverse stress conditions in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We found that the tRNA pool was dynamic and rearranged in a manner that facilitated selective translation of stress-related transcripts. Through genomic analysis of multiple data sets, stochastic simulations, and experiments with designed sequences of proteins with identical amino acids but altered codon usage, we showed that changes in tRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance affected protein expression independently of factors such as mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance. We suggest that cells alter their tRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance to selectively affect the translation rates of specific transcripts to increase the amounts of required proteins under diverse stress conditions.</p>

RORγt limits the amount of the cytokine receptor γc through the prosurvival factor Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in developing thymocytes
<p>The cytokine receptor subunit γc provides critical signals for T cell survival and differentiation. We investigated the molecular mechanism that controls the cell surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of γc during T cell development in the thymus. We found that the amount of γc was low on CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) thymocytes before their positive selection to become mature T cells. The transcription factor RORγt was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in immature DP thymocytes, and its loss resulted in an increase in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of surface γc, specifically on preselection DP cells. Rather than directly repressing expression of the gene encoding γc, RORγt acted through the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> to reduce the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of surface γc, which resulted in decreased cytokine signaling and was associated with inhibition of cell metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, overexpression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in RORγt-deficient thymocytes restored the amount of surface γc to that present on normal preselection DP cells. Together, these data highlight a previously unappreciated role for RORγt and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> in limiting γc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance at the cell surface and reveal a signaling circuit in which survival factors control cytokine signaling by limiting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and surface distribution of a receptor subunit shared by several cytokines.</p>

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth’s deep mantle

Coordination-induced weakening of ammonia, water, and hydrazine X–H bonds in a molybdenum complex

Here, we characterized the regulatory effects of the β<sub>4</sub> subunit in H9c2 rat cardiac cells on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of <i>Ifnb</i> mRNA [which encodes interferon-β (IFN-β)] and of the IFN-β–related genes <i>Ddx58</i>, <i>Ifitm3</i>, <i>Irf7</i>, <i>Stat2</i>, <i>Ifih1</i>, and <i>Mx1</i>, as well as on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of the antiviral proteins DDX58, IRF7, STAT2, and IFITM3. Knocking down the β<sub>4</sub> subunit in H9c2 cells reduced the expression of IFN-β–stimulated genes. In response to inhibition of the kinase JAK1, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of β<sub>4</sub> subunit mRNA and protein were decreased. β<sub>4</sub> subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance was increased, and it translocated to the nucleus, in cells treated with IFN-β, infected with dengue virus (DENV), or transfected with poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA. Cells that surrounded the virus-infected cells showed translocation of β<sub>4</sub> subunit proteins to nuclei in response to spreading infection. We showed that the β<sub>4</sub> subunit interacted with the transcriptional regulator IRF7 and that the activity of an <i>Irf7</i> promoter–driven reporter was increased in cells overexpressing the β<sub>4</sub> subunit. Last, overexpressing β<sub>4</sub> in undifferentiated and differentiated H9c2 cells reduced DENV infection and decreased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the viral proteins NS1, NS3, and E-protein. DENV infection and poly(I:C) also increased the concentration of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in these cells. These findings suggest that the β<sub>4</sub> subunit plays a role in promoting the expression of IFN-related genes, thereby reducing viral infection.</p>

PSMA redirects cell survival signaling from the MAPK to the PI3K-AKT pathways to promote the progression of prostate cancer
<p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate epithelium is a hallmark of advanced metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) and correlates negatively with prognosis. However, direct evidence that PSMA functionally contributes to PCa progression remains elusive. We generated mice bearing PSMA-positive or PSMA-negative PCa by crossing PSMA-deficient mice with transgenic PCa (TRAMP) models, enabling direct assessment of PCa incidence and progression in the presence or absence of PSMA. Compared with PSMA-positive tumors, PSMA-negative tumors were smaller, lower-grade, and more apoptotic with fewer blood vessels, consistent with the recognized proangiogenic function of PSMA. Relative to PSMA-positive tumors, tumors lacking PSMA had less than half the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), less activity in the survival pathway mediated by PI3K-AKT signaling, and more activity in the proliferative pathway mediated by MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. Biochemically, PSMA interacted with the scaffolding protein RACK1, disrupting signaling between the β<sub>1</sub> integrin and IGF-1R complex to the MAPK pathway, enabling activation of the AKT pathway instead. Manipulation of PSMA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in PCa cell lines recapitulated this signaling pathway switch. Analysis of published databases indicated that IGF-1R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance, cell proliferation, and expression of transcripts for antiapoptotic markers positively correlated with PSMA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in patients, suggesting that this switch may be relevant to human PCa. Our findings suggest that increase in PSMA in prostate tumors contributes to progression by altering normal signal transduction pathways to drive PCa progression and that enhanced signaling through the IGF-1R/β<sub>1</sub> integrin axis may occur in other tumors.</p>

The multiple merger assembly of a hyperluminous obscured quasar at redshift 4.6
<p>Galaxy mergers and gas accretion from the cosmic web drove the growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es and their central black holes at early epochs. We report spectroscopic imaging of a multiple merger event in the most luminous known galaxy, WISE J224607.56−052634.9 (W2246−0526), a dust-obscured quasar at redshift 4.6, 1.3 billion years after the Big Bang. Far-infrared dust continuum observations show three galaxy companions around W2246−0526 with disturbed morphologies, connected by streams of dust likely produced by the dynamical interaction. The detection of tidal dusty bridges shows that W2246−0526 is accreting its neighbors, suggesting that merger activity may be a dominant mechanism through which the most luminous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es simultaneously obscure and feed their central supermassive black holes.</p>

A whirling plane of satellite galaxies around Centaurus A challenges cold dark matter cosmology
<p>The Milky Way and Andromeda <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es are each surrounded by a thin plane of satellite dwarf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es that may be corotating. Cosmological simulations predict that most satellite galaxy systems are close to isotropic with random motions, so those two well-studied systems are often interpreted as rare statistical outliers. We test this assumption using the kinematics of satellite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">galaxi</span></strong>es around the Centaurus A galaxy. Our statistical analysis reveals evidence for corotation in a narrow plane: Of the 16 Centaurus A satellites with kinematic data, 14 follow a coherent velocity pattern aligned with the long axis of their spatial distribution. In standard cosmological simulations, <0.5% of Centaurus A–like systems show such behavior. Corotating satellite systems may be common in the universe, challenging small-scale structure formation in the prevailing cosmological paradigm.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> accumulation in seeds is a prerequisite for germination and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> transport processes and their interactions in seeds, we focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast transporter of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 transports Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe transport function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe transport. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjecting seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this transporter plays an important role in the generation of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> stores as well as for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

Claudin-6, -10d and -10e contribute to seawater acclimation in the euryhaline puffer fish <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i>
<p>Expression profiles of <i>claudin-6, -10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> in the euryhaline teleost fish <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i> revealed <i>claudin-6</i> in brain, eye, gill and skin tissue, while <i>claudin-10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> were found in brain, gill and skin only. In fishes, the gill and skin are important tissue barriers that interface directly with surrounding water, but these organs generally function differently in osmoregulation. Therefore, roles for gill and skin claudin-6, -10d and -10e in the osmoregulatory strategies of <i>T. nigroviridis</i> were investigated. In the gill epithelium, claudin-6, -10d and -10e co-localized with Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase immunoreactive (NKA-ir) ionocytes, and differences in sub-cellular localization could be observed in hypoosmotic (freshwater, FW) versus hyperosmotic (seawater, SW) environments. Claudin-10d and -10e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance increased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW versus FW, while claudin-6 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance decreased in the gills of fish acclimated to SW. Taken together with our knowledge of claudin-6 and -10 function in other vertebrates, data support the idea that in SW-acclimated <i>T. nigroviridis</i>, these claudins are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in gill ionocytes, where they contribute to the formation of a Na<sup>+</sup> shunt and ‘leaky’ epithelium, both of which are characteristic of salt-secreting SW fish gills. Skin claudin-10d and -10e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance also increased in fish acclimated to SW versus those in FW, but so did claudin-6. In skin, claudin-6 was found to co-localize with NKA-ir cells, but claudin-10d and -10e did not. This study provides direct evidence that the gill epithelium contains salinity-responsive tight junction proteins that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant primarily in ionocytes. These same proteins also appear to play a role in the osmoregulatory physiology of the epidermis.</p>

Extracellular Matrix Proteomics Reveals Interplay of Aggrecan and Aggrecanases in Vascular Remodeling of Stented Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling contributes to in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Despite its important clinical implications, little is known about ECM changes post–stent implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Bare-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> and drug-eluting stents were implanted in pig coronary arteries with an overstretch under optical coherence tomography guidance. Stented segments were harvested 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-stenting for proteomics analysis of the media and neointima.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 151 ECM and ECM-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. After stent implantation, proteins involved in regulating calcification were upregulated in the neointima of drug-eluting stents. The earliest changes in the media were proteins involved in inflammation and thrombosis, followed by changes in regulatory ECM proteins. By day 28, basement membrane proteins were reduced in drug-eluting stents in comparison with bare-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> stents. In contrast, the large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was increased. Aggrecanases of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>loproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family contribute to the catabolism of vascular proteoglycans. An increase in ADAMTS-specific aggrecan fragments was accompanied by a notable shift from <i>ADAMTS1</i> and <i>ADAMTS5</i> to <i>ADAMTS4</i> gene expression after stent implantation. Immunostaining in human stented coronary arteries confirmed the presence of aggrecan and aggrecan fragments, in particular, at the contacts of the stent struts with the artery. Further investigation of aggrecan presence in the human vasculature revealed that aggrecan and aggrecan cleavage were more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ant in human arteries than in human veins. In addition, aggrecan synthesis was induced on grafting a vein into the arterial circulation, suggesting an important role for aggrecan in vascular plasticity. Finally, lack of ADAMTS-5 activity in mice resulted in an accumulation of aggrecan and a dilation of the thoracic aorta, confirming that aggrecanase activity regulates aggrecan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in the arterial wall and contributes to vascular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant differences were identified by proteomics in the ECM of coronary arteries after bare-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> and drug-eluting stent implantation, most notably an upregulation of aggrecan, a major ECM component of cartilaginous tissues that confers resistance to compression. The accumulation of aggrecan coincided with a shift in <i>ADAMTS</i> gene expression. This study provides the first evidence implicating aggrecan and aggrecanases in the vascular injury response after stenting.</p></sec>

Decreased abundance of TRESK two-pore domain potassium channels in sensory neurons underlies the pain associated with bone metastasis
<p>Cancer-associated pain is debilitating. Understanding the mechanisms that cause it can inform drug development that may improve quality of life in patients. Here, we found that the reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of potassium channels called TRESK in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons sensitized nociceptive sensory neurons and cancer-associated pain. Overexpressing TRESK in DRG neurons suppressed tumor-induced neuronal hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in bone metastasis model rats, whereas knocking down TRESK increased neuronal hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in normal rats. Mechanistically, tumor-associated production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activated the receptor VEGFR2 on DRGs, which increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the calcineurin inhibitor DSCR1, which, in turn, decreased calcineurin-mediated activation of the transcription factor NFAT, thereby reducing the transcription of the gene encoding TRESK. Intrathecal application of exogenous calcineurin to tumor-bearing rats rescued TRESK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and abrogated both DRG hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity, whereas either inhibition or knockdown of calcineurin in normal rats reduced TRESK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and increased DRG excitability and pain sensitivity. These findings identify a potentially targetable mechanism that may cause bone metastasis–associated pain in cancer patients.</p>

MEG3-4 is a miRNA decoy that regulates IL-1β abundance to initiate and then limit inflammation to prevent sepsis during lung infection
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression. We investigated the role of lncRNAs in the inflammatory response to bacterial infection in the lungs. We identified the lncRNA MEG3 as a tissue-specific modulator of inflammatory responses during bacterial infection. Among the 10 transcript isoforms of MEG3, transcript 4 (referred to as MEG3-4) encodes the isoform with the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in mouse lungs. Nonetheless, we found that MEG3-4 bound to the microRNA miR-138 in a competitive manner with mRNA encoding the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), thereby increasing IL-1β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and intensifying inflammatory responses to bacterial infection in alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells in culture and in lung tissue in mice. MEG3-4–mediated sponging of miR-138 in the cytoplasm increased the autocrine activity of IL-1β that subsequently induced a negative feedback mechanism mediated by nuclear factor κB that decreased MEG3-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and inflammatory cytokine production. This timely reduction in MEG3-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance tempered proinflammatory responses in mice with pulmonary bacterial infection, preventing the progression to sepsis. Together, these findings reveal that MEG3-4 dynamically modulates pulmonary inflammatory responses through transcriptional regulation of immune response genes, extending the decoy and sponge mechanism associated with lncRNAs to antibacterial immunity, which affects both response and disease progression.</p>

Microtubules tune mechanotransduction through NOX2 and TRPV4 to decrease sclerostin abundance in osteocytes
<p>The adaptation of the skeleton to its mechanical environment is orchestrated by mechanosensitive osteocytes, largely by regulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of sclerostin, a secreted inhibitor of bone formation. We defined a microtubule-dependent mechanotransduction pathway that linked fluid shear stress to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals that led to a reduction in sclerostin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance in cultured osteocytes. We demonstrated that microtubules stabilized by detyrosination, a reversible posttranslational modification of polymerized α-tubulin, determined the stiffness of the cytoskeleton, which set the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to fluid shear stress. We showed that fluid shear stress through the microtubule network activated NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)–generated ROS that target the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel TRPV4 to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Furthermore, tuning the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of detyrosinated tubulin affected cytoskeletal stiffness to define the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to fluid shear stress. Finally, we demonstrated that NOX2-ROS elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that activated the kinase CaMKII to decrease the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of sclerostin protein. Together, these discoveries may identify potentially druggable targets for regulating osteocyte mechanotransduction to affect bone quality.</p>

Regulation of autophagy, NF-κB signaling, and cell viability by miR-124 in <i>KRAS</i> mutant mesenchymal-like NSCLC cells
<p><i>KRAS</i> mutant non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may be classified into epithelial or mesenchymal subtypes. Despite having the same “driver” mutation, mesenchymal NSCLCs are less responsive than are epithelial NSCLCs to inhibition of the RAS pathway. Identifying alternative networks that promote survival specifically in mesenchymal NSCLC may lead to more effective treatments for this subtype. Through their numerous targets in cellular signaling pathways, noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) often function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. In particular, some miRNAs regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We derived an EMT-related miRNA signature by profiling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of miRNAs in a panel of epithelial (KE) or mesenchymal (KM) <i>KRAS</i> mutant NSCLC cell lines. This signature revealed a number of suppressed miRNAs in KM cell lines, including members of the miR-200 family, which can suppress tumor progression by inhibiting EMT. Reconstituting KM cells with one of these miRNAs, miR-124, disrupted autophagy and decreased cell survival by reducing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of p62, which is both an adaptor for selective autophagy and a regulator of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Suppression of p62 by miR-124 correlated with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of the autophagy activator beclin 1 (BECN1), the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, and the NF-κB subunit RELA/p65. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance of miR-124 inversely correlated with the expression of <i>BECN1</i> and <i>TRAF6</i> in patient NSCLC samples. These findings reveal how the loss of miR-124 promotes cell survival networks in the aggressive mesenchymal subtype of <i>KRAS</i> mutant NSCLC, which might lead to improved subtype-selective therapeutic strategies for patients.</p>

In silico modeling identifies CD45 as a regulator of IL-2 synergy in the NKG2D-mediated activation of immature human NK cells
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells perform immunosurveillance of virally infected and transformed cells, and their activation depends on the balance between signaling by inhibitory and activating receptors. Cytokine receptor signaling can synergize with activating receptor signaling to induce NK cell activation. We investigated the interplay between the signaling pathways stimulated by the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the activating receptor NKG2D in immature (CD56<sup>bright</sup>) and mature (CD56<sup>dim</sup>) subsets of human primary NK cells using mass cytometry experiments and in silico modeling. Our analysis revealed that IL-2 changed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances of several key proteins, including NKG2D and the phosphatase CD45. Furthermore, we found differences in correlations between protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances, which were associated with the maturation state of the NK cells. The mass cytometry measurements also revealed that the signaling kinetics of key protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ances induced by NKG2D stimulation depended on the maturation state and the pretreatment condition of the NK cells. Our in silico model, which described the multidimensional data with coupled first-order reactions, predicted that the increase in CD45 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance was a major enhancer of NKG2D-mediated activation in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells but not in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells. This dependence on CD45 was verified by measurement of CD107a mobilization to the NK cell surface (a marker of activation). Our mathematical framework can be used to glean mechanisms underlying synergistic signaling pathways in other activated immune cells.</p>

Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-insulator transition in correlated materials is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition.

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy.

We prepared extremely large single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> foils by “contact-free annealing” from commercial polycrystalline foils. The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane crystal orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the crystal lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains. Industrial-scale production of single-crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> foils is possible as a result of this discovery.</p>

Probing the ultimate plasmon confinement limits with a van der Waals heterostructure
<p>The ability to confine light into tiny spatial dimensions is important for applications such as microscopy, sensing, and nanoscale lasers. Although plasmons offer an appealing avenue to confine light, Landau damping in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s imposes a trade-off between optical field confinement and losses. We show that a graphene-insulator-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> heterostructure can overcome that trade-off, and demonstrate plasmon confinement down to the ultimate limit of the length scale of one atom. This is achieved through far-field excitation of plasmon modes squeezed into an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride dielectric spacer between graphene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> rods. A theoretical model that takes into account the nonlocal optical response of both graphene and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> is used to describe the results. These ultraconfined plasmonic modes, addressed with far-field light excitation, enable a route to new regimes of ultrastrong light-matter interactions.</p>

Illuminating gravitational waves: A concordant picture of photons from a neutron star merger

<p>A correlation between giant-planet mass and atmospheric heavy elemental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance was first noted in the past century from observations of planets in our own Solar System and has served as a cornerstone of planet-formation theory. Using data from the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes from 0.5 to 5 micrometers, we conducted a detailed atmospheric study of the transiting Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-26b. We detected prominent H<sub>2</sub>O absorption bands with a maximum base-to-peak amplitude of 525 parts per million in the transmission spectrum. Using the water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance as a proxy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>licity, we measured HAT-P-26b’s atmospheric heavy element content ([Formula] times solar). This likely indicates that HAT-P-26b’s atmosphere is primordial and obtained its gaseous envelope late in its disk lifetime, with little contamination from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-rich planetesimals.</p>

Direct observation of individual hydrogen atoms at trapping sites in a ferritic steel
<p>The design of atomic-scale microstructural traps to limit the diffusion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> is one key strategy in the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-embrittlement–resistant materials. In the case of bearing steels, an effective trapping mechanism may be the incorporation of finely dispersed V-Mo-Nb carbides in a ferrite matrix. First, we charged a ferritic steel with deuterium by means of electrolytic loading to achieve a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> concentration. We then immobilized it in the microstructure with a cryogenic transfer protocol before atom probe tomography (APT) analysis. Using APT, we show trapping of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> within the core of these carbides with quantitative composition profiles. Furthermore, with this method the experiment can be feasibly replicated in any APT-equipped laboratory by using a simple cold chain.</p>

Hydrogen positions in single nanocrystals revealed by electron diffraction
<p>The localization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> atoms is an essential part of crystal structure analysis, but it is difficult because of their small scattering power. We report the direct localization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> atoms in nanocrystalline materials, achieved using the recently developed approach of dynamical refinement of precession electron diffraction tomography data. We used this method to locate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> atoms in both an organic (paracetamol) and an inorganic (framework cobalt aluminophosphate) material. The results demonstrate that the technique can reliably reveal fine structural details, including the positions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> atoms in single crystals with micro- to nanosized dimensions.</p>

Interfacial Effects in Iron-Nickel Hydroxide–Platinum Nanoparticles Enhance Catalytic Oxidation

The presence of this layer allowed the reaction to run rapidly at room temperature by bringing together different reaction sites on the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s. The addition of nickel improved catalyst lifetime, and an oxidative transformation created a more complex nanoparticle morphology that increased platinum utilization.</p></sec>

Evidence for Two Distinct Populations of Type Ia Supernovae

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty is not associated with cardiac disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Many case reports and small studies have suggested that cobalt   ions are a potential cause of cardiac complications, specifically   cardiomyopathy, after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-on-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> (MoM) total hip arthroplasty   (THA). The impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> ions on the incidence of cardiac disease   after MoM THA has not been evaluated in large studies. The aim of   this study was to compare the rate of onset of new cardiac symptoms   in patients who have undergone MoM THA with those who have undergone   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>-on-polyethylene (MoP) THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Data were extracted from the Standard Analytics Files database   for patients who underwent MoM THA between 2005 and 2012. Bearing   surface was selected using International Classification of Diseases   ninth revision codes. Patients with a minimum five-year follow-up   were selected. An age and gender-matched cohort of patients who underwent   MoP THA served as a comparison group. New diagnoses of cardiac disease   were collected during the follow-up period. Comorbidities and demographics   were identified and routine descriptive statistics were used.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We identified 29 483 patients who underwent MoM THA and 24 175   matched patients who underwent MoP THA. Both groups had a mean Charlson   comorbidity index score of 4. There were no statistically significant   differences in 30 of 31 pre-existing comorbidities. Patients undergoing   MoM THA had a slightly lower incidence of cardiac failure compared   with those undergoing MoP THA at three years (6.60% <i>versus</i> 7.06%,   odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.99)   and four years (8.73% <i>versus</i> 9.49%, OR 0.91, 95%   CI 0.86 to 0.97) postoperatively, with no difference in the incidence   of new cardiac failure in between the groups at five years. There   was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of   arrhythmia, myocardial infarction and cardiomyopathy at any time   between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MoM THA is not associated with cardiac complications.

Genotype-Dependent and -Independent Calcium Signaling Dysregulation in Human Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Aberrant calcium signaling may contribute to arrhythmias and adverse remodeling in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Mutations in sarcomere genes may distinctly alter calcium handling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed gene expression, protein levels, and functional assays for calcium regulatory pathways in human HCM surgical samples with (n=25) and without (n=10) sarcomere mutations compared with control hearts (n=8).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Gene expression and protein levels for calsequestrin, L-type calcium channel, sodium-calcium exchanger, phospholamban, calcineurin, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII) were similar in HCM samples compared with controls. CaMKII protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance was increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (<i>P</i><0.001). The CaMKII target pT17-phospholamban was 5.5-fold increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (<i>P</i>=0.01), as was autophosphorylated CaMKII (<i>P</i><0.01), suggestive of constitutive activation. Calcineurin (<i>PPP3CB</i>) mRNA was not increased, nor was <i>RCAN1</i> mRNA level, indicating a lack of calcineurin activation. Furthermore, myocyte enhancer factor 2 and nuclear factor of activated T cell transcription factor activity was not increased in HCM, suggesting that calcineurin pathway activation is not an upstream cause of increased CAMKII protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance or activation. <i>SERCA2A</i> mRNA transcript levels were reduced in HCM regardless of genotype, as was sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase 2/phospholamban protein ratio (45% reduced; <i>P</i>=0.03). <sup>45</sup>Ca sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPaseuptake assay showed reduced uptake velocity in HCM regardless of genotype (<i>P</i>=0.01). The cardiac ryanodine receptor was not altered in transcript, protein, or phosphorylated (pS2808, pS2814) protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance, and [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding was not different in HCM, consistent with no major modification of the ryanodine receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Human HCM demonstrates calcium mishandling through both genotype-specific and common pathways. Posttranslational activation of the CaMKII pathway is specific to sarcomere mutation–positive HCM, whereas sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca uptake are depressed in both sarcomere mutation–positive and –negative HCM.</p></sec>

Effect of Race and Ethnicity on Outcomes With Drug-Eluting and Bare Metal Stents
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients have been underrepresented in percutaneous coronary intervention clinical trials; therefore, there are limited data available on outcomes for these race/ethnicity groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined outcomes in 423 965 patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry database linked to Medicare claims for follow-up. Within each race/ethnicity group, we examined trends in drug-eluting stent (DES) use, 30-month outcomes, and relative outcomes of DES versus bare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> stents. Overall, 390 351 white, 20 191 black, 9342 Hispanic, and 4171 Asian patients > 65 years of age underwent stent implantation from 2004 through 2008 at 940 National Cardiovascular Data Registry participating sites.

Long-term outcomes were similar in Asians and whites (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.92–1.08).

Mechanically robust, readily repairable polymers via tailored noncovalent cross-linking
<p>Expanding the range of healable materials is an important challenge for sustainable societies. Noncrystalline, high-molecular-weight polymers generally form mechanically robust materials, which, however, are difficult to repair once they are fractured. This is because their polymer chains are heavily entangled and diffuse too sluggishly to unite fractured surfaces within reasonable time scales. Here we report that low-molecular-weight polymers, when cross-linked by dense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bonds, yield mechanically robust yet readily repairable materials, despite their extremely slow diffusion dynamics. A key was to use thiourea, which anomalously forms a zigzag <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-bonded array that does not induce unfavorable crystallization. Another key was to incorporate a structural element for activating the exchange of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong>-bonded pairs, which enables the fractured portions to rejoin readily upon compression.</p>

Light curves of the neutron star merger GW170817/SSS17a: Implications for r-process nucleosynthesis
<p>On 17 August 2017, gravitational waves (GWs) were detected from a binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the ejection of neutron-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">abund</span></strong>ance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> mergers play a role in rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

Synthesis of ultrasmall, homogeneously alloyed, bimetallic nanoparticles on silica supports
<p>Supported nanoparticles containing more than one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong> have a variety of applications in sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine. Common synthesis techniques for this type of material often result in large, unalloyed nanoparticles that lack the interactions between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s that give the particles their desired characteristics. We demonstrate a relatively simple, effective, generalizable method to produce highly dispersed, well-alloyed bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>lic nanoparticles. Ten permutations of noble and base <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s (platinum, palladium, copper, nickel, and cobalt) were synthesized with average particle sizes from 0.9 to 1.4 nanometers, with tight size distributions. High-resolution imaging and x-ray analysis confirmed the homogeneity of alloying in these ultrasmall nanoparticles.</p>

A precise measurement of the magnetic field in the corona of the black hole binary V404 Cygni
<p>Observations of binary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s containing an accreting black hole or neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> often show x-ray emission extending to high energies (>10 kilo­–electron volts), which is ascribed to an accretion disk corona of energetic particles akin to those seen in the solar corona. Despite their ubiquity, the physical conditions in accretion disk coronae remain poorly constrained. Using simultaneous infrared, optical, x-ray, and radio observations of the Galactic black hole system V404 Cygni, showing a rapid synchrotron cooling event in its 2015 outburst, we present a precise 461 ± 12 gauss magnetic field measurement in the corona. This measurement is substantially lower than previous estimates for such systems, providing constraints on physical models of accretion physics in black hole and neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> binary systems.</p>

Photoredox-catalyzed deuteration and tritiation of pharmaceutical compounds
<p>Deuterium- and tritium-labeled pharmaceutical compounds are pivotal diagnostic tools in drug discovery research, providing vital information about the biological fate of drugs and drug metabolites. Herein we demonstrate that a photoredox-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> atom transfer protocol can efficiently and selectively install deuterium (D) and tritium (T) at α-amino sp<sup>3</sup> carbon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> bonds in a single step, using isotopically labeled water (D<sub>2</sub>O or T<sub>2</sub>O) as the source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrogen</span></strong> isotope. In this context, we also report a convenient synthesis of T<sub>2</sub>O from T<sub>2</sub>, providing access to high-specific-activity T<sub>2</sub>O. This protocol has been successfully applied to the high incorporation of deuterium and tritium in 18 drug molecules, which meet the requirements for use in ligand-binding assays and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies.</p>

A liquid metal reaction environment for the room-temperature synthesis of atomically thin metal oxides
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) oxides have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many oxides are not easy to synthesize as 2D materials through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based alloys as a reaction solvent and co-alloyed desired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s into the melt. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, we predicted the composition of the self-limiting interfacial oxide. We isolated the surface oxide as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in suspension. This enabled us to produce extremely thin subnanometer layers of HfO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>–based reaction route can be used to create 2D materials that were previously inaccessible with preexisting methods. The work introduces room-temperature liquid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">metal</span></strong>s as a reaction environment for the synthesis of oxide nanomaterials with low dimensionality.</p>

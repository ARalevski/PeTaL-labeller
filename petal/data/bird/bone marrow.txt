Pericarditis as a Marker of Occult Cancer and a Prognostic Factor for Cancer Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pericarditis may be a serious complication of malignancy. Its significance as a first symptom of occult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and as a prognostic factor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> survival is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using Danish medical databases, we conducted a nationwide cohort study of all patients with a first-time diagnosis of pericarditis during 1994 to 2013. We excluded patients with previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and followed up the remaining patients for subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosis until November 30, 2013. We calculated risks and standardized incidence ratios of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> for patients with pericarditis compared with the general population. We assessed whether pericarditis predicts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> survival by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression using a matched comparison cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients without pericarditis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 13 759 patients with acute pericarditis, 1550 subsequently were diagnosed with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> during follow-up. The overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> standardized incidence ratio was 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–1.5), driven predominantly by increased rates of lung, kidney, and bladder <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, lymphoma, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukemia</span></strong>, and unspecified metastatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. The <3-month <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> risk among patients with pericarditis was 2.7%, and the standardized incidence ratio was 12.4 (95% CI, 11.2–13.7). The 3- to <12-month standardized incidence ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2–1.7), subsequently decreasing to 1.1 (95% CI, 1.0–1.2). Three-month survival after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosis was 80% and 86% among those with and without pericarditis, respectively, and the hazard ratio was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3–1.8). One-year survival was 65% and 70%, respectively, corresponding to a 3- to <12-month hazard ratio of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1–1.5).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Pericarditis may be a marker of occult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and augurs increased mortality after a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosis.</p></sec>

Osteoblasts remotely supply lung tumors with cancer-promoting SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow–derived myeloid cells can accumulate within tumors and foster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> outgrowth. Local immune-neoplastic interactions have been intensively investigated, but the contribution of the systemic host environment to tumor growth remains poorly understood. Here, we show in mice and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients (<i>n</i> = 70) that lung adenocarcinomas increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> stromal activity in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> metastasis. Animal studies reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> phenotype involves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>-resident osteocalcin-expressing (Ocn<sup>+</sup>) osteoblastic cells. These cells promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> by remotely supplying a distinct subset of tumor-infiltrating SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils, which exhibit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-promoting properties. Experimentally reducing Ocn<sup>+</sup> cell numbers suppresses the neutrophil response and lung tumor outgrowth. These observations posit osteoblasts as remote regulators of lung <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and identify SiglecF<sup>high</sup> neutrophils as myeloid cell effectors of the osteoblast-driven protumoral response.</p>

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomics is identifying “driver” mutations from the many neutral “passenger” mutations within a given tumor. To identify driver mutations that would otherwise be lost within mutational noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Cell Line Encyclopedia and The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation mutations occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 tumor-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were identified on the basis of amino acid conservation and mutational frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF mutations were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, despite its mutational frequency falling within the mutational noise for this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> type. The majority of mutations in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells harboring LOF mutations in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> driver mutations and define the JNK pathway as tumor-suppressive in gastric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Protein kinase N3 promotes bone resorption by osteoclasts in response to Wnt5a-Ror2 signaling
<p>Cytoskeletal reorganization in osteoclasts to form actin rings is necessary for these cells to attach to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> and resorb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> matrices. We delineated the pathway through which Wnt5a signaling through receptor tyrosine kinase–like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2) promoted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>-resorbing activity of osteoclasts. Wnt5a binding to Ror2 stimulated Rho, a small GTPase involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. Subsequently, the Rho effector kinase Pkn3 bound to and enhanced the activity of c-Src, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is critical for actin ring formation. Mice with an osteoclast-specific deficiency in <i>Ror2</i> (<i>Ror2</i><sup>ΔOcl/ΔOcl</sup>) had increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> mass. Osteoclasts derived from these mice exhibited impaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> resorption and actin ring formation, defects that were rescued by overexpression of constitutively active RhoA. These osteoclasts also exhibited reduced interaction between c-Src and Pkn3 and reduced c-Src kinase activity. Similar to <i>Ror2</i><sup>ΔOcl/ΔOcl</sup> mice, mice with a global deficiency of <i>Pkn3</i> (<i>Pkn3</i><sup>−/−</sup>) had increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> mass. The proline-rich region and kinase domain of Pkn3 were required to restore the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>-resorbing activity of osteoclasts derived from <i>Pkn3</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice. Thus, Pkn3 promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> resorption downstream of Wnt5a-Ror2-Rho signaling, and this pathway may be a therapeutic target for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontal disease.</p>

Load-induced changes in bone stiffness and cancellous and cortical bone mass following tibial compression diminish with age in female mice
<p>The vertebrate skeleton is an adaptive structure that responds to mechanical stimuli by increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> mass under increased mechanical loads. Although experimental animal models have shown the anabolic cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> response to applied load decreases with age, no consensus exists regarding whether this adaptive mechanism is affected by age in cancellous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>, the tissue most impacted by age-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> loss. We used an established murine <i>in vivo</i> tibial loading model to characterize the load-induced cancellous, cortical and whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> responses to mechanical stimuli in growing and mature female mice at 6, 10 and 16 weeks of age. The effects of applied load on tibial morphology and stiffness were determined using microcomputed tomography and <i>in vivo</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> strains measured at the medial tibial midshaft during applied loading. At all ages, 2 weeks of applied load produced larger midshaft cortical cross-sectional properties (+13–72%) and greater cancellous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> volume (+21–107%) and thicker trabeculae (+31–68%) in the proximal metaphyses of the loaded tibiae. The relative anabolic response decreased from 6 to 16 weeks of age in both the cancellous and cortical envelopes. Load-induced tibial stresses decreased more in 6-week-old mice following loading, which corresponded to increased <i>in vivo</i> tibial stiffness. Stiffness in the loaded tibiae of 16-week-old mice decreased despite moderately increased cortical cross-sectional geometry, suggesting load-induced changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> material properties. This study shows that the cancellous and cortical anabolic responses to mechanical stimuli decline with age into adulthood and that cortical cross-sectional geometry alone does not necessarily predict whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> functional stiffness.</p>

Mouse models of telomere dysfunction phenocopy skeletal changes found in human age-related osteoporosis
<p>A major medical challenge in the elderly is osteoporosis and the high risk of fracture. Telomere dysfunction is a cause of cellular senescence and telomere shortening, which occurs with age in cells from most human tissues, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>. Telomere defects contribute to the pathogenesis of two progeroid disorders characterized by premature osteoporosis, Werner syndrome and dyskeratosis congenital. It is hypothesized that telomere shortening contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> aging. We evaluated the skeletal phenotypes of mice with disrupted telomere maintenance mechanisms as models for human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> aging, including mutants in Werner helicase (<i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i>), telomerase (<i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i>) and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> double mutants. Compared with young wild-type (WT) mice, micro-computerized tomography analysis revealed that young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have decreased trabecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, as well as increased trabecular spacing. In cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>, young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have increased cortical thinning, and increased porosity relative to age-matched WT mice. These trabecular and cortical changes were accelerated with age in <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice compared with older WT mice. Histological quantification of osteoblasts in aged mice showed a similar number of osteoblasts in all genotypes; however, significant decreases in osteoid, mineralization surface, mineral apposition rate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> formation rate in older <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> suggest that osteoblast dysfunction is a prominent feature of precocious aging in these mice. Except in the <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i> single mutant, osteoclast number did not increase in any genotype. Significant alterations in mechanical parameters (structure model index, degree of anistrophy and moment of inertia) of the <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> femurs compared with WT mice were also observed. Young <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice had a statistically significant increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>-marrow fat content compared with young WT mice, which remained elevated in aged double mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants recapitulate the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> aging phenotype and are useful models for studying age-related osteoporosis.</p>

EMC10 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Protein Complex Subunit 10) Is a Bone Marrow–Derived Angiogenic Growth Factor Promoting Tissue Repair After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow cell–based therapies after acute myocardial infarction (MI) have produced mostly neutral results. Treatment with specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow cell–derived secreted proteins may provide an alternative biological approach to improving tissue repair and heart function after MI. We recently performed a bioinformatic secretome analysis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow cells from patients with acute MI and discovered a poorly characterized secreted protein, EMC10 (endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex subunit 10), showing activity in an angiogenic screen.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated the angiogenic potential of EMC10 and its mouse homolog (Emc10) in cultured endothelial cells and infarcted heart explants. We defined the cellular sources and function of Emc10 after MI using wild-type, <i>Emc10</i>-deficient, and <i>Emc10</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow–chimeric mice subjected to transient coronary artery ligation. Furthermore, we explored the therapeutic potential of recombinant Emc10 delivered by osmotic minipumps after MI in heart failure–prone FVB/N mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Emc10 signaled through small GTPases, p21-activated kinase, and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)–MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) pathway to promote actin polymerization and endothelial cell migration. Confirming the importance of these signaling events in the context of acute MI, Emc10 stimulated endothelial cell outgrowth from infarcted mouse heart explants via p38 MAPK-MK2. Emc10 protein abundance was increased in the infarcted region of the left ventricle and in the circulation of wild-type mice after MI. Emc10 expression was also increased in left ventricular tissue samples from patients with acute MI. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow–derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es and macrophages were the predominant sources of Emc10 in the infarcted murine heart. <i>Emc10</i> KO mice showed no cardiovascular phenotype at baseline. After MI, however, capillarization of the infarct border zone was impaired in KO mice, and the animals developed larger infarct scars and more pronounced left ventricular remodeling compared with wild-type mice. Transplanting KO mice with wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow cells rescued the angiogenic defect and ameliorated left ventricular remodeling. Treating FVB/N mice with recombinant Emc10 enhanced infarct border-zone capillarization and exerted a sustained beneficial effect on left ventricular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have identified Emc10 as a previously unknown angiogenic growth factor that is produced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow–derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es and macrophages as part of an endogenous adaptive response that can be enhanced therapeutically to repair the heart after MI.</p></sec>

Observed numbers of first hospitalizations for cerebrovascular events were compared with that expected from the general population using standardized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) and absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years. Cumulative incidence was calculated with death considered a competing risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 2782 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> survivors were hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event—40% higher than expected (SHR=1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.3–1.4). Survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (SHR=4.6, 95% confidence interval, 4.3–5.0), head and neck tumors (SHR=2.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.2–3.1), and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukemia</span></strong> (SHR=2.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.1) were at greatest risk. Males had significantly higher absolute excess risks than females (absolute excess risks =7 versus 3), especially among head and neck tumor survivors (absolute excess risks =30 versus 11).

The paradox of mutations and cancer
<p>The past decade has witnessed the cataloging of genetic mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes, providing new insights into how and in what ways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> can develop and spread (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). The focus has been on defining specific “driver” mutations, genetic errors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells that reveal basic biological processes gone awry that are required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> initiation and progression. These drivers are the target of new therapies—this concept is central to precision oncology efforts to treat patients according to the genetic changes that are present in their tumors (<i>3</i>). Along the way, it has also become apparent that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes harbor many additional “passenger” mutations (<i>4</i>). Patterns of driver and passenger DNA mutations derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes have provided clues about the different ways that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> can manifest as a disease of genetic mutations (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). In some circumstances, they can be linked to strong environmental carcinogens (for example, mutation patterns caused by tobacco smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or the fungal toxin aflatoxin) (<i>7</i>). Moreover, these forensic mutational patterns can be used to estimate how long it has taken for a tumor to develop (<i>5</i>). On page 911 of this issue, Martincorena <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) turned their attention toward the detection of mutations in normal tissue, addressing a long-standing paradox that mutations arise in normal tissues but do not necessarily lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

The chromatin accessibility landscape of primary human cancers
<p>We present the genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles of 410 tumor samples spanning 23 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types from The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identify 562,709 transposase-accessible DNA elements that substantially extend the compendium of known cis-regulatory elements. Integration of ATAC-seq (the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) with TCGA multi-omic data identifies a large number of putative distal enhancers that distinguish molecular subtypes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s, uncovers specific driving transcription factors via protein-DNA footprints, and nominates long-range gene-regulatory interactions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.

Fusion oncogenes—genetic musical chairs
<p>The cytogenetic definitions of many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s predate the genome sequencing era. Indeed, some classes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s (largely subtypes of sarcomas, lymphomas, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukemia</span></strong>s) have long been defined by simple and distinct patterns of chromosomal changes, or karyotypes, that, in many cases, feature a single pathognomonic somatic translocation of two genomic regions that creates a fusion oncogene (for example, the Philadelphia chromosome translocation in chronic myelogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leukemia</span></strong> results in the <i>BCR-ABL1</i> fusion oncogene) (<i>1</i>). Whereas many common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s display genomic complexity consistent with multistep oncogenesis, such as carcinomas of breast and lung, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s that are defined by translocations typically display simple karyotypes, suggesting that they were shaped by a single translocation. However, the cytogenetic simplicity of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s may mask more complex genomic events. On page 891 of this issue, Anderson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 50 Ewing sarcomas (EWSs), an aggressive sarcoma that is defined by fusion between the EWS RNA binding protein 1 (<i>EWSR1</i>) gene on chromosome 22 and an E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription factor gene, either <i>FLI1</i> at 11q24 or <i>ERG</i> at 21q11 (<i>3</i>). Anderson <i>et al.</i> show that ∼40% of <i>EWSR1-FLI1</i> fusions and all <i>EWSR1-ERG</i> fusions arise via a complex rearrangement pattern called chromoplexy, which was first identified in prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (<i>4</i>). They suggest that chromoplexy “bursts” may be early initiating events in Ewing sarcomagenesis and mark a more aggressive form of the disease.</p>

Cancer bypasses the lymph nodes
<p>“What did the lymph nodes show?” is the question whose answer is apprehensively awaited by every colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patient. Even in the age of molecular medicine, the absence or presence of colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> spread to regional lymph nodes remains the strongest predictor of whether surgery has cured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, or whether an individual may harbor occult metastatic disease and thus require adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce the risk of lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> metastases recurring in distant organs (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). But is colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> spread to lymph nodes a precursor of spread to another organ (e.g., the liver) or rather an indicator of colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells' metastatic competence? On page 55 of this issue, Naxerova <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) provide molecular evidence that, in many instances, colon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> metastases in the liver (and possibly other distant organs), originate from distinct clone(s) that differ from the founder(s) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> deposits in the lymph nodes.</p>

Stem cell divisions, somatic mutations, cancer etiology, and cancer prevention
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s are caused by mutations that may be inherited, induced by environmental factors, or result from DNA replication errors (R). We studied the relationship between the number of normal stem cell divisions and the risk of 17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types in 69 countries throughout the world. The data revealed a strong correlation (median = 0.80) between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> incidence and normal stem cell divisions in all countries, regardless of their environment. The major role of R mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> etiology was supported by an independent approach, based solely on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genome sequencing and epidemiological data, which suggested that R mutations are responsible for two-thirds of the mutations in human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. All of these results are consistent with epidemiological estimates of the fraction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s that can be prevented by changes in the environment. Moreover, they accentuate the importance of early detection and intervention to reduce deaths from the many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s arising from unavoidable R mutations.</p>

The distribution of heat in bone during radiofrequency ablation of an <i>ex vivo</i> bovine model of osteoid osteoma
<p>Osteoid osteoma is treated primarily by radiofrequency   (RF) ablation. However, there is little information about the distribution   of heat in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> during the procedure and its safety. We constructed   a model of osteoid osteoma to assess the distribution of heat in   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> and to define the margins of safety for ablation. Cavities   were drilled in cadaver bovine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>s and filled with a liver homogenate   to simulate the tumour matrix. Temperature-sensing probes were placed   in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> in a radial fashion away from the cavities. RF ablation   was performed 107 times in tumours < 10 mm in diameter (72 of   which were in cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>, 35 in cancellous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>), and 41 times   in cortical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> with models > 10 mm in diameter. Significantly   higher temperatures were found in cancellous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> than in cortical   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> (p < 0.05). For lesions up to 10 mm in diameter, in both   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> types, the temperature varied directly with the size of the   tumour (p < 0.05), and inversely with the distance from it. Tumours   of > 10 mm in diameter showed a trend similar to those of smaller   lesions. No temperature rise was seen beyond 12 mm from the edge   of a cortical tumour of any size. Formulae were developed to predict   the expected temperature in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> during ablation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:677–83</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
RUNX2 correlates with subtype-specific breast cancer in a human tissue microarray, and ectopic expression of <i>Runx2</i> perturbs differentiation in the mouse mammary gland
<p>RUNX2, a master regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">osteogenesi</span></strong>s, is oncogenic in the lymphoid lineage; however, little is known about its role in epithelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. Upregulation of <i>RUNX2</i> in cell lines correlates with increased invasiveness and the capacity to form osteolytic disease in models of breast and prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. However, most studies have analysed the effects of this gene in a limited number of cell lines and its role in primary breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> has not been resolved. Using a human tumour tissue microarray, we show that high RUNX2 expression is significantly associated with oestrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/HER2-negative breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s and that patients with high RUNX2 expression have a poorer survival rate than those with negative or low expression. We confirm <i>RUNX2</i> as a gene that has a potentially important functional role in triple-negative breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. To investigate the role of this gene in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, we made a transgenic model in which <i>Runx2</i> is specifically expressed in murine mammary epithelium under the control of the mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) promoter. We show that ectopic <i>Runx2</i> perturbs normal development in pubertal and lactating animals, delaying ductal elongation and inhibiting lobular alveolar differentiation. We also show that the <i>Runx2</i> transgene elicits age-related, pre-neoplastic changes in the mammary epithelium of older transgenic animals, suggesting that elevated RUNX2 expression renders such tissue more susceptible to oncogenic changes and providing further evidence that this gene might have an important, context-dependent role in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Exposure to Low-Dose Ionizing Radiation From Cardiac Procedures and Malignancy Risk in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) are exposed to increasing amounts of low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) from cardiac procedures. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> prevalence in this population is higher than in the general population. This study estimates the association between LDIR exposure from cardiac procedures and incident <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> in adult patients with CHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population derived from the Quebec Congenital Heart Disease Database. We measured cumulative numbers of LDIR-related cardiac procedures for each patient until 1 year before the time of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> diagnosis or administrative censoring. To assess the association between LDIR exposure and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> risk, we conducted a nested case-control study and matched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cases with controls on sex, CHD severity, birth year, and age.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study included 24 833 adult patients with CHD aged 18 to 64 years from 1995 to 2009. In >250 791 person-years of follow-up, 602 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cases were observed (median age, 55.4 years). The cumulative incidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> estimated up to 64 years of age was 15.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.2–16.5). Cases had more LDIR-related cardiac procedures than controls (1410 versus 921 per 1000 adult patients with CHD, <i>P</i><0.0001). Cumulative LDIR exposure was independently associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (odds ratio [OR], 1.08 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13). Similar results were obtained by using dose estimates for LDIR exposure (OR, 1.10 per 10 mSv; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15) with a possible dose-related response. The effect measure was in the same direction, and the association was persistent for exposure from ≥6 procedures in all sensitivity analyses: after excluding most smoking-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cases (OR, 1.10 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.05–1.16 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.77–5.37), and after applying a 3-year lag period (OR, 1.09 per procedure; 95% CI, 1.03–1.14 and OR when exposure from ≥6 procedures: 2.58; 95% CI, 1.43–4.69).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based study to analyze and document the association between LDIR-related cardiac procedures and incident <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> in the population of adults with CHD. Confirmations of these findings by prospective studies are needed to reinforce policy recommendations for radiation surveillance in patients with CHD where no regulation currently exists. Physicians ordering and performing cardiac imaging should ensure that exposure is as low as reasonably achievable without sacrificing quality of care.</p></sec>

Standardized mortality ratios, absolute excess risks, and cumulative risks were calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Two thousand sixteen survivors died of cardiac disease. For all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s combined, the standardized mortality ratios for all cardiac diseases combined was greatest for individuals diagnosed at 15 to 19 years of age (4.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.4–5.2) decreasing to 1.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.1–1.3) for individuals aged 35 to 39 years (2<i>P</i> for trend <0.0001).

C-reactive protein promotes bone destruction in human myeloma through the CD32–p38 MAPK–Twist axis
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> destruction is a hallmark of myeloma and affects 80% of patients. Myeloma cells promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> destruction by activating osteoclasts. In investigating the underlying mechanism, we found that C-reactive protein (CRP), a protein secreted in increased amounts by hepatocytes in response to myeloma-derived cytokines, activated myeloma cells to promote osteoclastogenesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> destruction in vivo. In mice bearing human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> grafts and injected with multiple myeloma cells, CRP bound to surface CD32 (also known as FcγRII) on myeloma cells, which activated a pathway mediated by the kinase p38 MAPK and the transcription factor Twist that enhanced the cells’ secretion of osteolytic cytokines. Furthermore, analysis of clinical samples from newly diagnosed myeloma patients revealed a positive correlation between the amount of serum CRP and the number of osteolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> lesions. These findings establish a mechanism by which myeloma cells are activated to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> destruction and suggest that CRP may be targeted to prevent or treat myeloma-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> disease in patients.</p>

Aging impairs both primary and secondary RIG-I signaling for interferon induction in human monocytes
<p>Adults older than 65 account for most of the deaths caused by respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infections, but the underlying mechanisms for this susceptibility are poorly understood. IAV RNA is detected by the cytosolic sensor retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I), which induces the production of type I interferons (IFNs) that curtail the spread of the virus and promote the elimination of infected cells. We have previously identified a marked defect in the IAV-inducible secretion of type I IFNs, but not proinflammatory cytokines, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older (>65 years) healthy human donors. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older adults exhibited decreased abundance of the adaptor protein TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3) because of its increased proteasomal degradation with age, thereby impairing the primary RIG-I signaling pathway for the induction of type I IFNs. We determined that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older adults also failed to effectively stimulate the production of the IFN regulatory transcription factor IRF8, which compromised IFN induction through secondary RIG-I signaling. IRF8 played a central role in IFN induction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es, because knocking down IRF8 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from younger adults was sufficient to replicate the IFN defects observed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es from older adults, whereas restoring IRF8 expression in older adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monocyt</span></strong>es was sufficient to restore RIG-I–induced IFN responses. Aging thus compromises both the primary and secondary RIG-I signaling pathways that govern expression of type I IFN genes, thereby impairing antiviral resistance to IAV.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 promotes glutamine metabolism in tumors by activating the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ
<p>Malignant tumors reprogram cellular metabolism to support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cell proliferation and survival. Although most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s depend on a high rate of aerobic glycolysis, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells also display addiction to glutamine. Glutamine transporters and glutaminase activity are critical for glutamine metabolism in tumor cells. We found that the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 activated the TEAD family transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), likely in a ligand-independent manner, to promote glutamine metabolism in cells and mouse models of HER2-positive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Overexpression of EphA2 induced the nuclear accumulation of YAP and TAZ and increased the expression of YAP/TAZ target genes. Inhibition of the GTPase Rho or the kinase ROCK abolished EphA2-dependent YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. Silencing <i>YAP</i> or <i>TAZ</i> substantially reduced the amount of intracellular glutamate through decreased expression of <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i>, respectively, genes that encode proteins that promote glutamine uptake and metabolism. The regulatory DNA elements of both <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i> contain TEAD binding sites and were bound by TEAD4 in an EphA2-dependent manner. In patient breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> tissues, <i>EphA2</i> expression positively correlated with that of <i>YAP</i> and <i>TAZ</i>, as well as that of <i>GLS</i> and <i>SLC1A5</i>. Although high expression of <i>EphA2</i> predicted enhanced metastatic potential and poor patient survival, it also rendered HER2-positive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells more sensitive to glutaminase inhibition. The findings define a previously unknown mechanism of EphA2-mediated glutaminolysis through YAP/TAZ activation in HER2-positive breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and identify potential therapeutic targets in patients.</p>

Loss of SPDEF and gain of TGFBI activity after androgen deprivation therapy promote EMT and bone metastasis of prostate cancer
<p>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) targeting the androgen receptor (AR) is a standard therapeutic regimen for treating prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. However, most tumors progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> after ADT. We identified the type 1, 2, and 4 collagen–binding protein transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ)–induced protein (TGFBI) as an important factor in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant progression of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. In prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cell lines, AR signaling stimulated the activity of the transcription factor SPDEF, which repressed the expression of <i>TGFBI</i>. ADT, AR antagonism, or overexpression of TGFBI inhibited the activity of SPDEF and enhanced the proliferation rates of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. Knockdown of TGFBI suppressed migration and proliferation in cultured cells and reduced prostate tumor growth and brain and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> metastasis in xenograft models, extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Analysis of prostate tissue samples collected before and after ADT from the same patients showed that ADT reduced the nuclear abundance of SPDEF and increased the production of TGFBI. Our findings suggest that induction of TGFBI promotes prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> growth and metastasis and can be caused by dysregulation or therapeutic inhibition of AR signaling.</p>

Intercellular transmission of the unfolded protein response promotes survival and drug resistance in cancer cells
<p>Increased protein translation in cells and various factors in the tumor microenvironment can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which initiates the unfolded protein response (UPR). We have previously reported that factors released from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells mounting a UPR induce a de novo UPR in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow–derived myeloid cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells that facilitates protumorigenic characteristics in culture and tumor growth in vivo. We investigated whether this intercellular signaling, which we have termed transmissible ER stress (TERS), also operates between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells and what its functional consequences were within the tumor. We found that TERS signaling induced a UPR in recipient human prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells that included the cell surface expression of the chaperone GRP78. TERS also activated Wnt signaling in recipient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells and enhanced resistance to nutrient starvation and common chemotherapies such as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the microtubule inhibitor paclitaxel. TERS-induced activation of Wnt signaling required the UPR kinase and endonuclease IRE1. However, TERS-induced enhancement of cell survival was predominantly mediated by the UPR kinase PERK and a reduction in the abundance of the transcription factor ATF4, which prevented the activation of the transcription factor CHOP and, consequently, the induction of apoptosis. When implanted in mice, TERS-primed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells gave rise to faster growing tumors than did vehicle-primed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that TERS is a mechanism of intercellular communication through which tumor cells can adapt to stressful environments.</p>

Androgen receptor inhibitor–induced “BRCAness” and PARP inhibition are synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s with loss-of-function mutations in <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> are deficient in the DNA damage repair pathway called homologous recombination (HR), rendering these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s exquisitely vulnerable to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. This functional state and therapeutic sensitivity is referred to as “BRCAness” and is most commonly associated with some breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types. Pharmaceutical induction of BRCAness could expand the use of PARP inhibitors to other tumor types. For example, <i>BRCA</i> mutations are present in only ~20% of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients. We found that castration-resistant prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> (CRPC) cells showed increased expression of a set of HR-associated genes, including <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>RAD54L</i>, and <i>RMI2</i>. Although androgen-targeted therapy is typically not effective in CRPC patients, the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide suppressed the expression of those HR genes in CRPC cells, thus creating HR deficiency and BRCAness. A “lead-in” treatment strategy, in which enzalutamide was followed by the PARP inhibitor olaparib, promoted DNA damage–induced cell death and inhibited clonal proliferation of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells in culture and suppressed the growth of prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> xenografts in mice. Thus, antiandrogen and PARP inhibitor combination therapy may be effective for CRPC patients and suggests that pharmaceutically inducing BRCAness may expand the clinical use of PARP inhibitors.</p>

Tissue-specificity in cancer: The rule, not the exception
<p>We are in the midst of a renaissance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genetics. Over the past several decades, candidate-based targeted sequencing efforts provided a steady stream of information on the genetic drivers for certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types. However, with recent technological advances in DNA sequencing, this stream has become a torrent of unbiased genetic information revealing the frequencies and patterns of point mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) across the entire spectrum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. One of the most important observations from this work is that genetic alterations in bona fide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> drivers (those genes that, when mutated, promote tumorigenesis) show a remarkable spectrum of tissue specificity: Alterations in certain driver genes appear only in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s derived from one or a few tissue types (<i>1</i>). Only a handful of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> drivers [such as telomerase reverse transcriptase (<i>TERT</i>), <i>TP53</i>, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (<i>CDKN2A</i>) locus, and <i>MYC</i>] show broad tissue spectrums. Here, we discuss the concept of tissue specificity of genetic alterations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and provide general hypotheses to help explain this biological phenomenon.</p>

Analysis of <i>Fusobacterium</i> persistence and antibiotic response in colorectal cancer

Use of CRISPR-modified human stem cell organoids to study the origin of mutational signatures in cancer
<p>Mutational processes underlie <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> initiation and progression. Signatures of these processes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> genomes may explain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> etiology and could hold diagnostic and prognostic value. We developed a strategy that can be used to explore the origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-associated mutational signatures. We used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete key DNA repair genes in human colon organoids, followed by delayed subcloning and whole-genome sequencing. We found that mutation accumulation in organoids deficient in the mismatch repair gene <i>MLH1</i> is driven by replication errors and accurately models the mutation profiles observed in mismatch repair–deficient colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. Application of this strategy to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> predisposition gene <i>NTHL1</i>, which encodes a base excision repair protein, revealed a mutational footprint (signature 30) previously observed in a breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cohort. We show that signature 30 can arise from germline <i>NTHL1</i> mutations.</p>

In this process, mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate to osteogenic precursor cells and thus represent an important source of newly forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>. By contrast, differentiated osteoblasts do not appear to contribute to repair of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> injuries in mammals; rather, osteoblasts form anew from mesenchymal stem cells. This raises the question whether osteoblast dedifferentiation is specific to appendage regeneration, a special feature of the lepidotrichia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> of the fish fin, or a process found more generally in fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>. Here, we show that dedifferentiation of mature osteoblasts is not restricted to fin regeneration after amputation, but also occurs during repair of zebrafish fin fractures and skull injuries. In both models, mature osteoblasts surrounding the injury downregulate the expression of differentiation markers, upregulate markers of the pre-osteoblast state and become proliferative. Making use of photoconvertible Kaede protein as well as Cre-driven genetic fate mapping, we show that osteoblasts migrate to the site of injury to replace damaged tissue. Our findings suggest a fundamental role for osteoblast dedifferentiation in reparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> formation in fish and indicate that adult fish osteoblasts display elevated cellular plasticity compared with mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>-forming cells.</p>

Interleukin-10 Inhibits Bone Marrow Fibroblast Progenitor Cell–Mediated Cardiac Fibrosis in Pressure-Overloaded Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) play a critical role in cardiac fibrosis; however, their origin in the diseased heart remains unclear, warranting further investigation. Recent studies suggest the contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow fibroblast progenitor cells (BM-FPCs) in pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis. We have previously shown that interleukin-10 (IL10) suppresses pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis; however, the role of IL10 in inhibition of BM-FPC–mediated cardiac fibrosis is not known. We hypothesized that IL10 inhibits pressure overload–induced homing of BM-FPCs to the heart and their transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts and thus attenuates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pressure overload was induced in wild-type (WT) and IL10 knockout (IL10KO) mice by transverse aortic constriction. To determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow origin, chimeric mice were created with enhanced green fluorescent protein WT mice marrow to the IL10KO mice. For mechanistic studies, FPCs were isolated from mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Pressure overload enhanced BM-FPC mobilization and homing in IL10KO mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, WT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow (from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice) transplantation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow–depleted IL10KO mice (IL10KO chimeric mice) reduced transverse aortic constriction–induced BM-FPC mobilization compared with IL10KO mice. Green fluorescent protein costaining with α-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1α in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric mice suggests that myofibroblasts were derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow after transverse aortic constriction. Finally, WT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow transplantation in IL10KO mice inhibited transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac fibrosis and improved heart function. At the molecular level, IL10 treatment significantly inhibited transforming growth factor-β–induced transdifferentiation and fibrotic signaling in WT BM-FPCs in vitro. Furthermore, fibrosis-associated microRNA (miRNA) expression was highly upregulated in IL10KO-FPCs compared with WT-FPCs. Polymerase chain reaction–based selective miRNA analysis revealed that transforming growth factor-β–induced enhanced expression of fibrosis-associated miRNAs (miRNA-21, -145, and -208) was significantly inhibited by IL10. Restoration of miRNA-21 levels suppressed the IL10 effects on transforming growth factor-β–induced fibrotic signaling in BM-FPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that IL10 inhibits BM-FPC homing and transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in pressure-overloaded myocardium. Mechanistically, we show for the first time that IL10 suppresses Smad–miRNA-21–mediated activation of BM-FPCs and thus modulates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec>

Detection and localization of surgically resectable cancers with a multi-analyte blood test
<p>Earlier detection is key to reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> deaths. Here, we describe a blood test that can detect eight common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types through assessment of the levels of circulating proteins and mutations in cell-free DNA. We applied this test, called <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>SEEK, to 1005 patients with nonmetastatic, clinically detected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s of the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, lung, or breast. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>SEEK tests were positive in a median of 70% of the eight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types. The sensitivities ranged from 69 to 98% for the detection of five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types (ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, and esophagus) for which there are no screening tests available for average-risk individuals. The specificity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>SEEK was greater than 99%: only 7 of 812 healthy controls scored positive. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>SEEK localized the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> to a small number of anatomic sites in a median of 83% of the patients.</p>

Cancer detection: Seeking signals in blood
<p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s are detected when they cause symptoms that lead to medical evaluation. Unfortunately, in too many cases this results in diagnosis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s that are locally invasive or already metastatic and hence no longer curable with surgical resection or radiation treatment. Medical therapies, which might be curative in the setting of minimal tumor burden, typically provide more limited benefit in more advanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s, given the emergence of drug resistance (<i>1</i>). On page 926 of this issue, Cohen <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) describe a strategy for early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> detection, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>SEEK, aimed at screening for multiple different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s within the general population.

Mutational signatures associated with tobacco smoking in human cancer
<p>Tobacco smoking increases the risk of at least 17 classes of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. We analyzed somatic mutations and DNA methylation in 5243 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s of types for which tobacco smoking confers an elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutation burdens of multiple distinct mutational signatures, which contribute to different extents in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s. One of these signatures, mainly found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s derived from tissues directly exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to misreplication of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens. Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike mutational process. Smoking is associated with limited differences in methylation. The results are consistent with the proposition that smoking increases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> risk by increasing the somatic mutation load, although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in some smoking-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> types.</p>

The conformational state of hERG1 channels determines integrin association, downstream signaling, and cancer progression
<p>Ion channels regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in normal and neoplastic cells through cell-cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) transmembrane receptors called integrins. K<sup>+</sup> flux through the human ether-à-go-go–related gene 1 (hERG1) channel shapes action potential firing in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes. Its abundance is often aberrantly high in tumors, where it modulates integrin-mediated signaling. We found that hERG1 interacted with the β<sub>1</sub> integrin subunit at the plasma membrane of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. This interaction was not detected in cardiomyocytes because of the presence of the hERG1 auxiliary subunit KCNE1 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E regulatory subunit 1), which blocked the β<sub>1</sub> integrin–hERG1 interaction. Although open hERG1 channels did not interact as strongly with β<sub>1</sub> integrins as did closed channels, current flow through hERG1 channels was necessary to activate the integrin-dependent phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>397</sup> in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in both normal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells. In immunodeficient mice, proliferation was inhibited in breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells expressing forms of hERG1 with impaired K<sup>+</sup> flow, whereas metastasis of breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells was reduced when the hERG1/β<sub>1</sub> integrin interaction was disrupted. We conclude that the interaction of β<sub>1</sub> integrins with hERG1 channels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells stimulated distinct signaling pathways that depended on the conformational state of hERG1 and affected different aspects of tumor progression.</p>

Mutated clones are the new normal
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s are formed by the expansion of harmful “mutational clones,” which are cell populations carrying the same DNA mutations. How harmful they are depends on which mutated genes they contain. On page 970 of this issue, Yizhak <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) add to the evidence that normal tissues are not so normal after all. Examining a substantial number of healthy tissues from almost 500 individuals, they found a large number of acquired (somatic) DNA mutations—some of which are typically associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>—and mutational clones of macroscopic size, in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> pathology. The presence in normal tissues of clonal cell populations, with mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>-associated genes, is informative about how a tumor evolves from the first mutation to a benign growth and, finally, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>.</p>

Dampening oncogenic RAS signaling
<p>The control of normal cellular homeostasis is a function of signaling by the RAS guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS and their downstream signaling proteins, such as the RAF kinases (BRAF and CRAF), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), which together constitute the RAS-MAPK pathway (<i>1</i>). This pathway is dysregulated in human diseases, particularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>, in which mutations or other nongenetic events hyperactivate the pathway in more than 50% of cases (<i>1</i>). Activating mutations in RAS genes occur in more than 30% of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s and seemingly lock RAS into a constitutively active, GTP-bound state to signal autonomously without the need for upstream input (<i>1</i>). Therapeutic suppression of pathogenic RASMAPK signaling to maximize disease control in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients remains an elusive goal. Multiple strategies targeting upstream [e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)] or downstream (e.g., MEK) RAS pathway proteins to limit RAS-GTP–mediated signaling in RAS-MAPK pathway–driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s are under evaluation (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). However, recent studies have extended our knowledge of how certain forms of oncogenic RAS and other oncogenic MAPK pathway proteins function not in an autonomous manner but instead semiautonomously, such that they still respond to upstream regulation (<i>4</i>–<i>8</i>). These findings reveal mechanisms by which RAS signaling is dysregulated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> and highlight newly identified therapeutic strategies with the potential to target oncogenic RAS-MAPK signaling.</p>

Neutrophil extracellular traps produced during inflammation awaken dormant cancer cells in mice
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells from a primary tumor can disseminate to other tissues, remaining dormant and clinically undetectable for many years. Little is known about the cues that cause these dormant cells to awaken, resume proliferating, and develop into metastases. Studying mouse models, we found that sustained lung inflammation caused by tobacco smoke exposure or nasal instillation of lipopolysaccharide converted disseminated, dormant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells to aggressively growing metastases. Sustained inflammation induced the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and these were required for awakening dormant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>. Mechanistic analysis revealed that two NET-associated proteases, neutrophil elastase and matrix metalloproteinase 9, sequentially cleaved laminin. The proteolytically remodeled laminin induced proliferation of dormant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells by activating integrin α3β1 signaling. Antibodies against NET-remodeled laminin prevented awakening of dormant cells. Therapies aimed at preventing dormant cell awakening could potentially prolong the survival of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients.</p>

Hepatic thrombopoietin is required for bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell maintenance
<p>Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance depends on extrinsic cues. Currently, only local signals arising from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow niche have been shown to maintain HSCs. However, it is not known whether systemic factors also sustain HSCs. We assessed the physiological source of thrombopoietin (TPO), a key cytokine required for maintaining HSCs. Using <i>Tpo<sup>DsRed-CreER</sup></i> knock-in mice, we showed that TPO is expressed by hepatocytes but not by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow cells. Deletion of <i>Tpo</i> from hematopoietic cells, osteoblasts, or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow mesenchymal stromal cells does not affect HSC number or function. However, when <i>Tpo</i> is deleted from hepatocytes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow HSCs are depleted. Thus, a cross-organ factor, circulating TPO made in the liver by hepatocytes, is required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> marrow HSC maintenance. Our results demonstrate that systemic factors, in addition to the local niche, are a critical extrinsic component for HSC maintenance.</p>

Lymph node metastases can invade local blood vessels, exit the node, and colonize distant organs in mice
<p>Lymph node metastases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> patients are associated with tumor aggressiveness, poorer prognoses, and the recommendation for systemic therapy.

This technology allowed us to selectively photoconvert metastatic cells in the lymph node and trace their fate.

Thus, in mouse models, lymph node metastases can be a source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> cells for distant metastases.

Nerves switch on angiogenic metabolism
<p>Nerves release neurotransmitters to regulate most physiologic functions in the body.

Mismatch repair deficiency predicts response of solid tumors to PD-1 blockade
<p>The genomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s deficient in mismatch repair contain exceptionally high numbers of somatic mutations. In a proof-of-concept study, we previously showed that colorectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s with mismatch repair deficiency were sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade with antibodies to programmed death receptor–1 (PD-1). We have now expanded this study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced mismatch repair–deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s across 12 different tumor types. Objective radiographic responses were observed in 53% of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21% of patients. Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not reached. Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the tumor. These data support the hypothesis that the large proportion of mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair–deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s make them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, regardless of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong>s’ tissue of origin.</p>

<i>Rb1</i> and <i>Trp53</i> cooperate to suppress prostate cancer lineage plasticity, metastasis, and antiandrogen resistance
<p>Prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> relapsing from antiandrogen therapies can exhibit variant histology with altered lineage marker expression, suggesting that lineage plasticity facilitates therapeutic resistance. The mechanisms underlying prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> lineage plasticity are incompletely understood. Studying mouse models, we demonstrate that <i>Rb1</i> loss facilitates lineage plasticity and metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma initiated by <i>Pten</i> mutation. Additional loss of <i>Trp53</i> causes resistance to antiandrogen therapy. Gene expression profiling indicates that mouse tumors resemble human prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> neuroendocrine variants; both mouse and human tumors exhibit increased expression of epigenetic reprogramming factors such as Ezh2 and Sox2. Clinically relevant Ezh2 inhibitors restore androgen receptor expression and sensitivity to antiandrogen therapy. These findings uncover genetic mutations that enable prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> progression; identify mouse models for studying prostate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> lineage plasticity; and suggest an epigenetic approach for extending clinical responses to antiandrogen therapy.</p>

Proximal femoral replacement in contemporary revision total hip arthroplasty for severe femoral bone loss
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Loss or absence of proximal femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> in revision total hip   arthroplasty (THA) remains a significant challenge. While the main   indication for the use of proximal femoral replacements (PFRs) is   in the treatment of malignant disease, they have a valuable role   in revision THA for loosening, fracture and infection in patients   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> loss. Our aim was to determine the clinical outcomes,   implant survivorship, and complications of PFRs used in revision   THA for indications other than malignancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review of 44 patients who underwent revision   THA using a PFR between 2000 and 2013 was undertaken. Their mean   age was 79 years (53 to 97); 31 (70%) were women. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> loss   was classified as Paprosky IIIB or IV in all patients. The mean   follow-up was six years (2 to 12), at which time 22 patients had   died and five were lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean Harris Hip Score improved from 42.8 (25.9 to 82.9) pre-operatively   to 68.5 (21.0 to 87.7) post-operatively (p = 0.0009). A total of   two PFRs had been revised, one for periprosthetic infection eight   years post-operatively and one for aseptic loosening six years post-operatively.   The Kaplan-Meier survivorship free of any revision or removal of   an implant was 86% at five years and 66% years at ten years. A total   of 12 patients (27%) had a complication including six with a dislocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>PFRs provide a useful salvage option for patients, particularly   the elderly with massive proximal femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> loss who require   revision THA, with significant clinical improvement. While the survivorship   of the implant is good at five years, dislocation continues to be   the most common complication. The judicious use of larger femoral   heads, dual-mobility constructs, or constrained liners may help   to minimise the risk of dislocation.</p><p>Cite this article: <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:325–9.</p></sec>

Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a standard length intramedullary cemented stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical plates have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the survivorship   of short-stemmed endoprostheses and extra-cortical plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 37 patients who underwent limb salvage surgery   for a primary neoplasm of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> between 1998 and 2013. Endoprosthetic   replacement involved the proximal humerus in nine, the proximal   femur in nine, the distal femur in 13 and the proximal tibia in   six patients. There were 12 primary (32%) and 25 revision procedures (68%).   Implant survivorship was compared with matched controls. The amount   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> that was resected was > 70% of its length and statistically   greater than the standard control group at each anatomical site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was seven years (one to 17). The mean length   of the stem was 33 mm (20 to 60) in the humerus and 79 mm (34 to   100) in the lower limb. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of the   implant according to anatomical site confirmed that there was no   statistically significant difference between the short-stemmed endoprostheses and   the standard stemmed controls at the proximal humeral (p = 0.84),   proximal femoral (p = 0.57), distal femoral (p = 0.21) and proximal   tibial (p = 0.61) sites.</p><p>In the short-stemmed group, no implants with extra-cortical plate   osseointegration suffered loosening at a mean of 8.5 years (range   2 to 16 years). Three of ten (30%) without osseointegration suffered   aseptic loosening at a mean of 7.7 years (range 2 to 11.5 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When extensive resections of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> are required in the surgical   management of tumours, and in revision cases, the addition of extra-cortical   plates to short medullary stems has shown non-inferiority to standard   length medullary stems and minimises aseptic failure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1689–95.</p></sec>

Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis in the United Kingdom
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) infection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>s and joints accounts for   6.7% of TB cases in England, and is associated with significant   morbidity and disability. Public Health England reports that patients   with TB experience delays in diagnosis and treatment. Our aims were   to determine the demographics, presentation and investigation of   patients with a TB infection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>s and joints, to help doctors   assessing potential cases and to identify avoidable delays.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective observational study of all adults with   positive TB cultures on specimens taken at a tertiary orthopaedic   centre between June 2012 and May 2014. A laboratory information   system search identified the patients. The demographics, clinical presentation,   radiology, histopathology and key clinical dates were obtained from   medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 31 adult patients were identified. Their median age   was 37 years (interquartile range (IQR): 29 to 53); 21 (68%) were   male; 89% were migrants. The main sites affected were joints (10,   32%), the spine (8, 26%) and long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong>s (6, 19%); 8 (26%) had multifocal   disease. The most common presenting symptoms were pain (29/31, 94%)   and swelling (26/28, 93%). ‘Typical’ symptoms of TB, such as fever,   sweats and weight loss, were uncommon. Patients waited a median   of seven months (IQR 3 to 13.5) between the onset of symptoms and referral   to the tertiary centre and 2.3 months (IQR 1.6 to 3.4.)) between   referral and starting treatment. Radiology suggested TB in 26 (84%),   but in seven patients (23%) the initial biopsy specimens were not   sent for mycobacterial culture, necessitating a second biopsy. Rapid   Polymerase Chain Reaction-based testing for TB using Xpert MTB/RIF   was performed in five patients; 4 (80%) tested positive for TB.   These patients had a reduced time between the diagnostic biopsy and   starting treatment than those whose samples were not tested (median   eight days <i>versus</i> 36 days, p = 0.016).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> and joint TB experience delays in diagnosis   and treatment, some of which are avoidable. Maintaining a high index   of clinical suspicion and sending specimens for mycobacterial culture   are crucial to avoid missing cases. Rapid diagnostic tests reduce   delays and should be performed on patients with radiological features of   TB.</p><p>Cite this article: <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bone</span></strong> Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:119–24.</p></sec>

Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Older Women After Contemporary Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes are resistant to radiation. However, cardiac radiation exposure causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation, a perturbation implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) and particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Radiotherapy for breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> results in variable cardiac radiation exposure and may increase the risk of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a population-based case-control study of incident HF in 170 female residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (59 cases and 111 controls), who underwent contemporary (1998–2013) radiotherapy for breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> with computed tomography–assisted radiotherapy planning. Controls were matched to cases for age, tumor side, chemotherapy use, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Mean cardiac radiation dose (MCRD) in each patient was calculated from the patient’s computed tomography images and radiotherapy plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean age at radiotherapy was 69±9 years. Of HF cases, 38 (64%) had EF≥50% (HFpEF), 18 (31%) had EF<50% (HF with reduced EF), and 3 (5%) did not have EF measured. The EF was ≥40% in 50 of the 56 HF cases (89%) with an EF measurement. The mean interval from radiotherapy to HF was 5.8±3.4 years. The odds of HF was higher in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or atrial fibrillation. The MCRD was 2.5 Gy (range, 0.2–13.1 Gy) and higher in cases (3.3±2.7 Gy) than controls (2.1±2.0 Gy; <i>P</i>=0.004). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HF per log MCRD was 9.1 (3.4–24.4) for any HF, 16.9 (3.9–73.7) for HFpEF, and 3.17 (0.8–13.0) for HF with reduced EF. The increased odds of any HF or HFpEF with increasing MCRD remained significant after adjustment for HF risk factors and in sensitivity analyses matching by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> stage rather than tumor side. Only 18.6% of patients experienced new or recurrent ischemic events between radiotherapy and the onset of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The relative risk of HFpEF increases with increasing cardiac radiation exposure during contemporary conformal breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> radiotherapy. These data emphasize the importance of radiotherapy techniques that limit MCRD during breast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cancer</span></strong> treatment. Moreover, these data provide further support for the importance of coronary microvascular compromise in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.</p></sec>

Tough adhesives for diverse wet surfaces
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion to wet and dynamic surfaces, including biological tissues, is important in many fields but has proven to be extremely challenging. Existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives are cytotoxic, adhere weakly to tissues, or cannot be used in wet environments. We report a bioinspired design for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives consisting of two layers: an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive surface and a dissipative matrix. The former adheres to the substrate by electrostatic interactions, covalent bonds, and physical interpenetration. The latter amplifies energy dissipation through hysteresis. The two layers synergistically lead to higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion energies on wet surfaces as compared with those of existing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion occurs within minutes, independent of blood exposure and compatible with in vivo dynamic movements. This family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives may be useful in many areas of application, including tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ives, wound dressings, and tissue repair.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion from actin-mediated transport and measured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth. This model predicts that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

PROTEIN PHOSHATASE 2A B’<i>α</i> and <i>β</i> Maintain Centromeric Sister Chromatid Cohesion during Meiosis in Arabidopsis
<p>The correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, and sister chromatids during meiosis II, relies on the tight control of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cohes</span></strong>ion complex. The phosphorylation and subsequent cleavage of the meiotic recombination protein REC8 (REC8-like family protein [SYN1] in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]), the α-kleisin subunit of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cohes</span></strong>ion ring, along the chromosome arms at meiosis I allows crossovers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes without chromatid dissociation. REC8 continues to localize and function at the centromeres up to metaphase II and, in yeast and vertebrates, is protected from cleavage by means of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation. Here, we show that, in plants, centromeric sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cohes</span></strong>ion until meiosis II also requires the activity of a PP2A-type phosphatase complex. The combined absence of the regulatory subunits PP2AB′α and PP2AB′β leads to the premature loss of chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cohes</span></strong>ion in meiosis I. Male meiocytes of the <i>pp2ab′αβ</i> double mutant display premature depletion of SYN1. The PP2AA1 structural and B′α regulatory subunit localize specifically to centromeres until metaphase II, supporting a role for the PP2A complex in the SYN1-mediated maintenance of centromeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cohes</span></strong>ion in plant meiosis.</p>

Tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices pinch collagen fibers to support 3D cell migration
<p>Migrating cells often use focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ions in order to move. Focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ions are less prominent in cells migrating in three-dimensional (3D) as compared with 2D environments. We looked for alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion structures supporting cell migration. We analyzed the dynamics of clathrin-coated pits in cells migrating in a 3D environment of collagen fibers. Both topological cues and local engagement of integrins triggered the accumulation of clathrin-coated structures on fibers. Clathrin/adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) lattices pinched collagen fibers by adopting a tube-like morphology and regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion to fibers in an endocytosis-independent manner. During migration, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices stabilized cellular protrusions by providing anchoring points to collagen fibers. Thus, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices promote cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion that, in coordination with focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ions, supports cell migration in 3D.</p>

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cohes</span></strong>ion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cohes</span></strong>ion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cohes</span></strong>in complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cohes</span></strong>ion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

Hindered cytoplasmic diffusion of inositol trisphosphate restricts its cellular range of action
<p>The range of action of intracellular messengers is determined by their rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion and degradation. Previous measurements in oocyte cytoplasmic extracts indicated that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-liberating second messenger inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es with a coefficient (~280 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) similar to that in water, corresponding to a range of action of ~25 μm. Consequently, IP<sub>3</sub> is generally considered a “global” cellular messenger. We reexamined this issue by measuring local IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs to monitor IP<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ing from spot photorelease in neuroblastoma cells. Fitting these data by numerical simulations yielded a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient (≤10 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) about 30-fold slower than that previously reported. We propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of IP<sub>3</sub> in mammalian cells is hindered by binding to immobile, functionally inactive receptors that were diluted in oocyte extracts. The predicted range of action of IP<sub>3</sub> (<5 μm) is thus smaller than the size of typical mammalian cells, indicating that IP<sub>3</sub> should better be considered as a local rather than a global cellular messenger.</p>

RhoB controls the Rab11-mediated recycling and surface reappearance of LFA-1 in migrating T lymphocytes
<p>The regulation of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and motility is complex and requires the intracellular trafficking of integrins to and from sites of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion, especially in fast-moving cells such as leukocytes. The Rab family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) is essential for vesicle transport, and vesicles mediate intracellular integrin trafficking. We showed that RhoB regulates the vesicular transport of the integrin LFA-1 along the microtubule network in migrating T lymphocytes. Impairment in RhoB function resulted in the accumulation of both LFA-1 and the recycling endosomal marker Rab11 at the rear of migrating T lymphocytes and decreased the association between these molecules. T lymphocytes lacking functional RhoB exhibited impaired recycling and subsequently decreased surface amounts of LFA-1, leading to reduced T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and migration mediated by the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion molecule ICAM-1 (intercellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion molecule–1). We propose that vesicle-associated RhoB is a regulator of the Rab11-mediated recycling of LFA-1 to the cell surface, an event that is necessary for T lymphocyte motility.</p>

The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 promotes T cell adhesion by activating the adaptor protein CrkII in the immunological synapse
<p>The adaptor protein CrkII regulates T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion by recruiting the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, an activator of Rap1. Subsequently, Rap1 stimulates the integrin LFA-1, which leads to T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion of T cells to APCs is critical for their proper function and education. The interface between the T cell and the APC is known as the immunological synapse. It is characterized by the specific organization of proteins that can be divided into central supramolecular activation clusters (c-SMACs) and peripheral SMACs (p-SMACs). Through total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and experiments with supported lipid bilayers, we determined that activated Rap1 was recruited to the immunological synapse and localized to the p-SMAC. C3G and the active (dephosphorylated) form of CrkII also localized to the same compartment. In contrast, inactive (phosphorylated) CrkII was confined to the c-SMAC. Activation of CrkII and its subsequent movement from the c-SMAC to the p-SMAC depended on the phosphatase SHP-1, which acted downstream of the T cell receptor. In the p-SMAC, CrkII recruited C3G, which led to Rap1 activation and LFA-1–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion of T cells to APCs. Functionally, SHP-1 was necessary for both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and migration of T cells. Together, these data highlight a signaling pathway in which SHP-1 acts through CrkII to reshape the pattern of Rap1 activation in the immunological synapse.</p>

Design and control of gas diffusion process in a nanoporous soft crystal

Preventing mussel adhesion using lubricant-infused materials
<p>Mussels are opportunistic macrofouling organisms that can attach to most immersed solid surfaces, leading to serious economic and ecological consequences for the maritime and aquaculture industries. We demonstrate that lubricant-infused coatings exhibit very low preferential mussel attachment and ultralow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive strengths under both controlled laboratory conditions and in marine field studies. Detailed investigations across multiple length scales—from the molecular-scale characterization of deposited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive proteins to nanoscale contact mechanics to macroscale live observations—suggest that lubricant infusion considerably reduces fouling by deceiving the mechanosensing ability of mussels, deterring secretion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive threads, and decreasing the molecular work of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion.

Protoplast Swelling and Hypocotyl Growth Depend on Different Auxin Signaling Pathways
<p>Members of the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN (TIR1/AFB) family are known auxin receptors. To analyze the possible receptor function of AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1), an auxin receptor currently under debate, we performed different approaches. We performed a pharmacological approach using α-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (auxinole), α-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-acetic acid (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-acetic acid (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We used a peptide of the carboxyl-terminal region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of <i>ABP1</i>, <i>abp1-c1</i> and <i>abp1-TD1</i>, and the TILLING mutant <i>abp1-5</i>. We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino acid exchange in the auxin-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl growth, both at high temporal resolution. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing; instead, it showed auxin activity in the hypocotyl growth test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an auxin-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing response but no hypocotyl growth. The carboxyl-terminal peptide of AtABP1 induced an auxin-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing response. In the <i>ABP1</i>-related mutants and Coimbra, no auxin-induced protoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid auxin-induced protoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing, but it is not involved in the control of rapid auxin-induced growth.</p>

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading

Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-system in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-system structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-system. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-system remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-system components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-system density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing (<i>P</i><0.01).

In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-system density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-system density versus cells with high t-system density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-system in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma.

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

<p>The discovery of new materials for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ating ethylene from ethane by adsorption, instead of using cryogenic distillation, is a key milestone for molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations because of the multiple and widely extended uses of these molecules in industry. This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility. Control of such properties extends the boundaries for applicability of zeolites to challenging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations.</p>

When early adopters don't adopt
<p>Individuals who naturally adopt a new technology early are important for influencing whether and how the technology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>es more broadly among later users (<i>1</i>–<i>7</i>). Such natural early adopters (NEAs) may influence the difference between successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of new technology and failure. Yet the factors that most influence how and why NEAs engage with new technologies are not entirely understood. We asked, “What if natural early adopters are not able to adopt early?” This paper is the first to measure the counterfactual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion curve that occurs when NEAs are not allowed to adopt early. The results suggest that NEAs can stifle broader <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of a technology if their usual ability to be first—and to derive value from being first—is compromised. Small changes in the initial availability of a technology among different types of users can have a lasting effect on its potential.</p>

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion of plant cells is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between cell wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant cells are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border cells are examples of this. Border cells (in some species known as border-like cells) provide an expendable barrier between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex cellular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip cell walls. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of cell wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of cell wall components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified multiple novel modes of cell wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border cells. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border cell maturation and enable us to develop a model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation process. We propose that loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of cell curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

Sucrose Transporter Localization and Function in Phloem Unloading in Developing Stems
<p>How sucrose transporters (SUTs) regulate phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing in monocot stems is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high Suc concentrations. To this end, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> SUTs SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 were characterized by determining their transport properties heterologously expressed in yeast or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and their in planta cellular and subcellular localization. The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong selectivity for Suc and high Suc affinities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at pH 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc affinity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and pH. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc affinity was independent of membrane potential and pH but supported high transport rates at neutral pH. Suc transport by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using yeast or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to sieve elements, while for elongating and recently elongated internodes, SUTs also were detected in storage parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing from de-energized protophloem sieve elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. Storage parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of elongating and recently elongated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to release Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into metaphloem sieve elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing by bulk flow.</p>

A dynamic cell adhesion surface regulates tissue architecture in growth plate cartilage
<p>The architecture and morphogenetic properties of tissues are founded in the tissue-specific regulation of cell behaviors. In endochondral bones, the growth plate cartilage promotes bone elongation via regulated chondrocyte maturation within an ordered, three-dimensional cell array. A key event in the process that generates this cell array is the transformation of disordered resting chondrocytes into clonal columns of discoid proliferative cells aligned with the primary growth vector. Previous analysis showed that column-forming chondrocytes display planar cell divisions, and the resulting daughter cells rearrange by ∼90° to align with the lengthening column. However, these previous studies provided limited information about the mechanisms underlying this dynamic process. Here we present new mechanistic insights generated by application of a novel time-lapse confocal microscopy method along with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We show that, during cell division, daughter chondrocytes establish a cell-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion surface enriched in cadherins and β-catenin. Rearrangement into columns occurs concomitant with expansion of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion surface in a process more similar to cell spreading than to migration. Column formation requires cell-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion, as reducing cadherin binding via chelation of extracellular calcium inhibits chondrocyte rearrangement. Importantly, physical indicators of cell polarity, such as cell body alignment, are not prerequisites for oriented cell behavior. Our results support a model in which regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive surface dynamics and cortical tension by extrinsic signaling modifies the thermodynamic landscape to promote organization of daughter cells in the context of the three-dimensional growth plate tissue.</p>

CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart disease is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV disease (MVD), the cellular and molecular pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory molecules from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion molecule very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart disease valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative molecules including arginase-1 and resistin-like molecule α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion molecule–1. Conditionally deleting the vascular cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion molecule-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart disease. We define key inflammatory molecules that drive MVD in this model, including Syk, TNF, interleukin-6, very late antigen–4, and vascular cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion molecule–1.</p></sec>

An intramembrane sensory circuit monitors sortase A–mediated processing of streptococcal adhesins
<p>Bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ins mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion to substrates and biofilm formation. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ins of the LPXTG family are posttranslationally processed by the cell membrane–localized peptidase sortase A, which cleaves the LPXTG motif. This generates a short C-terminal peptide (C-pep) that remains in the cell membrane, whereas the mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>in is incorporated into the cell wall. Genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ins of the oral bacterium <i>Streptococcus gordonii</i> were differentially expressed depending on whether the bacteria were isolated from saliva or dental plaque and appeared to be coordinately regulated. Deletion of <i>sspA</i> and <i>sspB (sspAB)</i>, both of which encode LPXTG-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ins, unexpectedly enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and biofilm formation. C-peps produced from a model LPXTG-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>in localized to the cell membrane and bound to and inhibited the intramembrane sensor histidine kinase SGO_1180, thus preventing activation of the cognate response regulator SGO_1181. The absence of SspAB C-peps induced the expression of the <i>scaCBA</i> operon encoding the lipoprotein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>in ScaA, which was sufficient to preserve and even enhance biofilm formation. This C-pep–driven regulatory circuit also exists in pathogenic streptococci and is likely conserved among Gram-positive bacteria.

Cadherin-11–mediated adhesion of macrophages to myofibroblasts establishes a profibrotic niche of active TGF-β
<p>Macrophages contribute to the activation of fibroblastic cells into myofibroblasts, which secrete collagen and contract the collagen matrix to acutely repair injured tissue. Persistent myofibroblast activation leads to the accumulation of fibrotic scar tissue that impairs organ function. We investigated the key processes that turn acute beneficial repair into destructive progressive fibrosis. We showed that homotypic cadherin-11 interactions promoted the specific binding of macrophages to and persistent activation of profibrotic myofibroblasts. Cadherin-11 was highly abundant at contacts between macrophages and myofibroblasts in mouse and human fibrotic lung tissues. In attachment assays, cadherin-11 junctions mediated specific recognition and strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion between macrophages and myofibroblasts. One functional outcome of cadherin-11–mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion was locally restricted activation of latent transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) between macrophage-myofibroblast pairs that was not observed in cocultures of macrophages and myofibroblasts that were not in contact with one another. Our data suggest that cadherin-11 junctions maintain latent TGF-β–producing macrophages and TGF-β–activating myofibroblasts in close proximity to one another. Inhibition of homotypic cadherin-11 interactions could be used to cause macrophage-myofibroblast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation, thereby destabilizing the profibrotic niche.</p>

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Extension of chemotactic pseudopods by nonadherent human neutrophils does not require or cause calcium bursts
<p>Global bursts in free intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) are among the most conspicuous signaling events in immune cells. To test the common view that Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts mediate rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton in response to the activation of G protein–coupled receptors, we combined single-cell manipulation with fluorescence imaging and monitored the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in individual human neutrophils during complement-mediated chemotaxis. By decoupling purely chemotactic pseudopod formation from cell-substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion, we showed that physiological concentrations of anaphylatoxins, such as C5a, induced nonadherent human neutrophils to form chemotactic pseudopods but did not elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts. By contrast, pathological or supraphysiological concentrations of C5a often triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts, but pseudopod protrusion stalled or reversed in such cases, effectively halting chemotaxis, similar to sepsis-associated neutrophil paralysis. The maximum increase in cell surface area during pseudopod extension in pure chemotaxis was much smaller—by a factor of 8—than the known capacity of adherent human neutrophils to expand their surface. Because the measured rise in cortical tension was not sufficient to account for this difference, we attribute the limited deformability to a reduced ability of the cytoskeleton to generate protrusive force in the absence of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion. Thus, we hypothesize that Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts in neutrophils control a mechanistic switch between two distinct modes of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics. A key element of this switch appears to be the expedient coordination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion-dependent lock or release events of cytoskeletal membrane anchors.</p>

Spin transport in a Mott insulator of ultracold fermions

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness

In a coexpanded supersonic beam, we have studied the rotationally inelastic process wherein deuterium hydride (HD) (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) collides with molecular deuterium (D<sub>2</sub>) to form HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 1), where <i>v</i> and <i>j</i> are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, respectively. HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) was prepared by Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage, with its bond axis aligned preferentially parallel or perpendicular to the lab-fixed relative velocity. The coexpansion brought the collision temperature down to 1 kelvin, restricting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing to s and p partial waves. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing angular distributions showed a dramatic stereodynamic preference (~3:1) for perpendicular versus parallel alignment. The four-vector correlation measured between the initial and final velocities and the initial and final rotational angular momentum vectors of HD provides insight into the strong anisotropic forces present in the collision process.</p>

Nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance with chemical resolution
<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a key analytical technique in chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, conventional NMR spectroscopy requires an at least nanoliter-sized sample volume to achieve sufficient signal. We combined the use of a quantum memory and high magnetic fields with a dedicated quantum sensor based on nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond to achieve chemical shift resolution in <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy of 20-zeptoliter sample volumes. We demonstrate the application of NMR pulse sequences to achieve homonuclear decoupling and spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion measurements. The best measured NMR linewidth of a liquid sample was ~1 part per million, mainly limited by molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion. To mitigate the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, we performed high-resolution solid-state NMR by applying homonuclear decoupling and achieved a 20-fold narrowing of the NMR linewidth.</p>

Neutron scattering in the proximate quantum spin liquid α-RuCl<sub>3</sub>
<p>The Kitaev quantum spin liquid (KQSL) is an exotic emergent state of matter exhibiting Majorana fermion and gauge flux excitations. The magnetic insulator α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> is thought to realize a proximate KQSL. We used neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing on single crystals of α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> to reconstruct dynamical correlations in energy-momentum space. We discovered highly unusual signals, including a column of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing over a large energy interval around the Brillouin zone center, which is very stable with temperature. This finding is consistent with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing from the Majorana excitations of a KQSL. Other, more delicate experimental features can be transparently associated with perturbations to an ideal model. Our results encourage further study of this prototypical material and may open a window into investigating emergent magnetic Majorana fermions in correlated materials.</p>

Identification of LRRC8 Heteromers as an Essential Component of the Volume-Regulated Anion Channel VRAC
<sec><title>One <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong> Ion Channel</title><p>When mammalian cells are faced with osmotic challenges, they need to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong> or shrink. The molecular characterization of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) remains unknown, although many candidate proteins have been proposed. <bold>Voss <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 634, published online 10 April; see the Perspective by <bold>Mindell</bold>) used a genome-wide screen to identify a group of leucine-rich repeat–containing (LRRC) proteins necessary for forming VRAC. Suppression of LRRC8A nearly eliminated the presence of VRAC in mammalian cells. A heterooligomer of LRRC proteins appears to form VRAC. Identification of VRAC components is an essential step forward in the understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">swell</span></strong>ing-activated ion channels and provides opportunities for understanding both the mechanism of the channel and its role in physiology.</p></sec>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Sucrose Transporter <i>ZmSut1</i> Expression and Localization Uncover New Insights into Sucrose Phloem Loading
<p>Sucrose transporters (SUTs) translocate sucrose (Suc) across cellular membranes, and in eudicots, multiple SUTs are known to function in Suc phloem loading in leaves. In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), the <i>Sucrose Transporter1</i> (<i>ZmSut1</i>) gene has been implicated in Suc phloem loading based upon RNA expression in leaves, electrophysiological experiments, and phenotypic analysis of <i>zmsut1</i> mutant plants. However, no previous studies have examined the cellular expression of <i>ZmSut1</i> RNA or the subcellular localization of the ZmSUT1 protein to assess the gene’s hypothesized function in Suc phloem loading or to evaluate its potential roles, such as phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing, in nonphotosynthetic tissues. To this end, we performed RNA in situ hybridization experiments, promoter-reporter gene analyses, and ZmSUT1 localization studies to elucidate the cellular expression pattern of the <i>ZmSut1</i> transcript and protein. These data showed that <i>ZmSut1</i> was expressed in multiple cell types throughout the plant and indicated that it functions in phloem companion cells to load Suc and also in other cell types to retrieve Suc from the apoplasm to prevent its accumulation and loss to the transpiration stream. Additionally, by comparing a phloem-mobile tracer with <i>ZmSut1</i> expression, we determined that developing maize leaves dynamically switch from symplasmic to apoplasmic phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing, reconciling previously conflicting reports, and suggest that <i>ZmSut1</i> does not have an apparent function in either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing process. A model for the dual roles for <i>ZmSut1</i> function (phloem loading and apoplasmic recycling), <i>Sut1</i> evolution, and its possible use to enhance Suc export from leaves in engineering C<sub>3</sub> grasses for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is discussed.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, environmental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing environmental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy habitats. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite effect. To evaluate the combined effect of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing effects of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

In Vivo Functional Selection Identifies Cardiotrophin-1 as a Cardiac Engraftment Factor for Mesenchymal Stromal Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Transplantation of cells into the infarcted heart has significant potential to improve myocardial recovery; however, low efficacy of cell engraftment still limits therapeutic benefit. Here, we describe a method for the unbiased, in vivo selection of cytokines that improve mesenchymal stromal cell engraftment into the heart both in normal conditions and after myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>An arrayed library of 80 secreted factors, including most of the currently known interleukins and chemokines, were individually cloned into adeno-associated viral vectors. Pools from this library were then used for the batch transduction of bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stromal cells ex vivo, followed by intramyocardial cell administration in normal and infarcted mice. Three weeks after injection, vector genomes were recovered from the few persisting cells and identified by sequencing DNA barcodes uniquely labeling each of the tested cytokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The most effective molecule identified by this competitive engraftment screening was cardiotrophin-1, a member of the interleukin-6 family. Intracardiac injection of mesenchymal stromal cells transiently preconditioned with cardiotrophin-1 preserved cardiac function and reduced infarct size, parallel to the persistence of the transplanted cells in the healing hearts for at least 2 months after injection. Engraftment of cardiotrophin-1–treated mesenchymal stromal cells was consequent to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3–mediated activation of the focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion kinase and its associated focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion complex and the consequent acquisition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ive properties by the cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results support the feasibility of selecting molecules in vivo for their functional properties with adeno-associated viral vector libraries and identify cardiotrophin-1 as a powerful cytokine promoting cell engraftment and thus improving cell therapy of the infarcted myocardium.</p></sec>

Safety and Efficacy of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning in Patients With Severe Carotid Artery Stenosis Before Carotid Artery Stenting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) can inhibit recurrent ischemic events effectively in patients with acute or chronic cerebral ischemia. However, it is still unclear whether RIPC can impede ischemic injury after carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Subjects with severe carotid artery stenosis were recruited in this randomized controlled study, and assigned to RIPC, sham, and no intervention (control) groups. All subjects received standard medical therapy. Subjects in the RIPC and sham groups underwent RIPC and sham RIPC twice daily, respectively, for 2 weeks before CAS. Plasma neuron-specific enolase and S-100B were used to evaluate safety, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, and new ischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging lesions were used to determine treatment efficacy. The primary outcomes were the presence of ≥1 newly ischemic brain lesions on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging within 48 hours after stenting and clinical events within 6 months after stenting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We randomly assigned 189 subjects in this study (63 subjects in each group). Both RIPC and sham RIPC procedures were well tolerated and completed with high compliance (98.41% and 95.24%, respectively). Neither plasma neuron-specific enolase levels nor S-100B levels changed significantly before and after treatment. No severe adverse event was attributed to RIPC and sham RIPC procedures. The incidence of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-weighted imaging lesions in the RIPC group (15.87%) was significantly lower than in the sham group (36.51%; relative risk, 0.44; 96% confidence interval, 0.20–0.91; <i>P</i><0.01) and the control group (41.27%; relative risk, 0.39; 96% confidence interval, 0.21–0.82; <i>P</i><0.01). The volumes of lesions were smaller in the RIPC group than in the control and sham groups (<i>P</i><0.01 each). Ischemic events that occurred after CAS were 1 transient ischemic attack in the RIPC group, 2 strokes in the control group, and 2 strokes and 1 transient ischemic attack in the sham group, but these results were not significantly different among the 3 groups (<i>P</i>=0.597).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RIPC is safe in patients undergoing CAS, which may be able to decrease ischemic brain injury secondary to CAS. However, the mechanisms and effects of RIPC on clinical outcomes in this cohort of patients need further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Microstructural Impact of Ischemia and Bone Marrow–Derived Cell Therapy Revealed With Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging Tractography of the Heart In Vivo
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The arrangement of myofibers in the heart is highly complex and must be replicated by injected cells to produce functional myocardium.

Mice (n=12) were then injected with bone marrow mononuclear cells 3 weeks after coronary ligation. In half of the mice the donor and recipient strains were identical, and in half the strains were different. A positive response to cell injection was defined by a decrease in mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ivity, an increase in fractional anisotropy, and the appearance of new myofiber tracts with the correct orientation. A positive response to bone marrow mononuclear cell injection was seen in 1 mouse.

<i>chaoptin</i>, <i>prominin</i>, <i>eyes shut</i> and <i>crumbs</i> form a genetic network controlling the apical compartment of <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptor cells
<p>The apical surface of epithelial cells is often highly specialised to fulfil cell type-specific functions. Many epithelial cells expand their apical surface by forming microvilli, actin-based, finger-like membrane protrusions. The apical surface of <i>Drosophila</i> photoreceptor cells (PRCs) forms tightly packed microvilli, which are organised into the photosensitive rhabdomeres. As previously shown, the GPI-anchored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion protein Chaoptin is required for the stability of the microvilli, whereas the transmembrane protein Crumbs is essential for proper rhabdomere morphogenesis. Here we show that <i>chaoptin</i> synergises with <i>crumbs</i> to ensure optimal rhabdomere width. In addition, reduction of <i>crumbs</i> ameliorates morphogenetic defects observed in PRCs mutant for <i>prominin</i> and <i>eyes shut</i>, known antagonists of <i>chaoptin</i>. These results suggest that these four genes provide a balance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion and anti-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion to maintain microvilli development and maintenance. Similar to <i>crumbs</i> mutant PRCs, PRCs devoid of <i>prominin</i> or <i>eyes shut</i> undergo light-dependent retinal degeneration. Given the observation that human orthologues of <i>crumbs</i>, <i>prominin</i> and <i>eyes shut</i> result in progressive retinal degeneration and blindness, the <i>Drosophila</i> eye is ideally suited to unravel the genetic and cellular mechanisms that ensure morphogenesis of PRCs and their maintenance under light-mediated stress.</p>

A SAP domain-containing protein shuttles between the nucleus and cell membranes and plays a role in adhesion and migration in <i>D. discoideum</i>
<p>The AmpA protein reduces cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion, thereby influencing cell migration in <i>Dictyostelium</i>. To understand how <i>ampA</i> influences cell migration, second site suppressors of an AmpA overexpressing cell line were created by REMI mutagenesis. Mutant candidates were identified by their ability to suppress the large plaques that the AmpA overexpressing cells form on bacterial lawns as a result of their increased rate of migration. One suppressor gene, <i>sma</i>, encodes an uncharacterized protein, which contains a SAP DNA-binding domain and a PTEN-like domain. Using <i>sma</i> gene knockouts and Sma-mRFP expressing cell lines, a role for <i>sma</i> in influencing cell migration was uncovered. Knockouts of the <i>sma</i> gene in a wild-type background enhanced chemotaxis. An additional role for Sma in influencing cell–cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion was also demonstrated. Sma protein transitions between cytosolic and nuclear localizations as a function of cell density. In growing cells migrating to folic acid it is localized to regions of actin polymerization and absent from the nucleus. A role for Sma in influencing <i>ampA</i> mRNA levels is also demonstrated. Sma additionally appears to be involved in <i>ampA</i> pathways regulating cell size, actin polymerization, and cell substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adhes</span></strong>ion. We present insights to the SAP domain-containing group of proteins in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and provide evidence of a role for a SAP domain-containing protein shuttling from the nucleus to sites of actin polymerization during chemotaxis to folic acid and influencing the efficiency of migration.</p>

An excess of massive stars in the local 30 Doradus starburst
<p>The 30 Doradus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud is a nearby analog of large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-formation events in the distant universe. We determined the recent formation history and the initial mass function (IMF) of massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s in 30 Doradus on the basis of spectroscopic observations of 247 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s more massive than 15 solar masses ([Formula]). The main episode of massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation began about 8 million years (My) ago, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-formation rate seems to have declined in the last 1 My. The IMF is densely sampled up to 200 [Formula] and contains 32 ± 12% more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s above 30 [Formula] than predicted by a standard Salpeter IMF. In the mass range of 15 to 200 [Formula], the IMF power-law exponent is [Formula], shallower than the Salpeter value of 2.35.</p>

Shear properties of Earth’s inner core constrained by a detection of <i>J</i> waves in global correlation wavefield
<p>Seismic <i>J</i> waves, shear waves that traverse Earth’s inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>, provide direct constraints on the inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>’s solidity and shear properties. However, these waves have been elusive in the direct seismic wavefield because of their small amplitudes. We devised a new method to detect <i>J</i> waves in the earthquake coda correlation wavefield. They manifest through the similarity with other compressional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>-sensitive signals. The inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> is solid, but relatively soft, with shear-wave speeds and shear moduli of 3.42 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 149.0 ± 1.6 gigapascals (GPa) near the inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> boundary and 3.58 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 167.4 ± 1.6 GPa in Earth’s center. The values are 2.5% lower than the widely used Preliminary Earth Reference Model. This provides new constraints on the dynamical interpretation of Earth’s inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>.</p>

Fast molecular outflow from a dusty star-forming galaxy in the early Universe
<p>Galaxies grow inefficiently, with only a small percentage of the available gas converted into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s each free-fall time. Feedback processes, such as outflowing winds driven by radiation pressure, supernovae, or supermassive black hole accretion, can act to halt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation if they heat or expel the gas supply. We report a molecular outflow launched from a dust-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-forming galaxy at redshift 5.3, 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The outflow reaches velocities up to 800 kilometers per second relative to the galaxy, is resolved into multiple clumps, and carries mass at a rate within a factor of 2 of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation rate. Our results show that molecular outflows can remove a large fraction of the gas available for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation from galaxies at high redshift.</p>

Structure of the maize photosystem I supercomplex with light-harvesting complexes I and II
<p>Plants regulate photosynthetic light harvesting to maintain balanced energy flux into photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII). Under light conditions favoring PSII excitation, the PSII antenna, light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), is phosphorylated and forms a supercomplex with PSI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> and the PSI antenna, light-harvesting complex I (LHCI). Both LHCI and LHCII then transfer excitation energy to the PSI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>. We report the structure of maize PSI-LHCI-LHCII solved by cryo–electron microscopy, revealing the recognition site between LHCII and PSI. The PSI subunits PsaN and PsaO are observed at the PSI-LHCI interface and the PSI-LHCII interface, respectively. Each subunit relays excitation to PSI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> through a pair of chlorophyll molecules, thus revealing previously unseen paths for energy transfer between the antennas and the PSI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>.</p>

Illuminating gravitational waves: A concordant picture of photons from a neutron star merger
<p>Merging neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s offer an excellent laboratory for simultaneously studying strong-field gravity and matter in extreme environments. We establish the physical association of an electromagnetic counterpart (EM170817) with gravitational waves (GW170817) detected from merging neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s. By synthesizing a panchromatic data set, we demonstrate that merging neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s are a long-sought production site forging heavy elements by r-process nucleosynthesis. The weak gamma rays seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-ray bursts with ultrarelativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet explains the low-luminosity gamma rays, the high-luminosity ultraviolet-optical-infrared, and the delayed radio and x-ray emission. We posit that all neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> mergers may lead to a wide-angle cocoon breakout, sometimes accompanied by a successful jet and sometimes by a choked jet.</p>

Melting of Iron at Earth’s Inner Core Boundary Based on Fast X-ray Diffraction
<sec><title>Hot Enough to Melt Iron</title><p>Earth's <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> is divided into a fluid outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> and a solid inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>, both composed predominately of iron at extremely high pressures and temperatures.

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Long-range exciton transport in conjugated polymer nanofibers prepared by seeded growth

A precise measurement of the magnetic field in the corona of the black hole binary V404 Cygni

Using simultaneous infrared, optical, x-ray, and radio observations of the Galactic black hole system V404 Cygni, showing a rapid synchrotron cooling event in its 2015 outburst, we present a precise 461 ± 12 gauss magnetic field measurement in the corona.

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The magnetic fields of solar-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the turbulent convective layers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s and have a complex dependency upon stellar rotation rate. We have performed a set of turbulent global simulations that exhibit magnetic cycles varying systematically with stellar rotation and luminosity. We find that the magnetic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of rotation on turbulent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s.</p>

Relativistic deflection of background starlight measures the mass of a nearby white dwarf star
<p>Gravitational deflection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>light around the Sun during the 1919 total solar eclipse provided measurements that confirmed Einstein’s general theory of relativity. We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the analogous process of astrometric microlensing caused by a nearby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>, the white dwarf Stein 2051 B. As Stein 2051 B passed closely in front of a background <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>, the background <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>’s position was deflected. Measurement of this deflection at multiple epochs allowed us to determine the mass of Stein 2051 B—the sixth-nearest white dwarf to the Sun—as 0.675 ± 0.051 solar masses. This mass determination provides confirmation of the physics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">degenerate matt</span></strong>er and lends support to white dwarf evolutionary theory.</p>

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions

Current models for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> structure are based on crystallography of hexameric and cross-linked pentameric CA, electron microscopy of tubular CA arrays, and simulations. Here, we report subnanometer-resolution cryo–electron tomography structures of hexameric and pentameric CA within intact HIV-1 particles. Whereas the hexamer structure is compatible with crystallography studies, the pentamer forms using different interfaces. Determining multiple structures revealed how CA flexes to form the variably curved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> shell.

The intermetallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> and uniform four layers of Pt shell of the PtPb/Pt nanoplates appear to underlie the high endurance of these catalysts, which can undergo 50,000 voltage cycles with negligible activity decay and no apparent structure and composition changes.</p>

Dynamic Changes between Two LHCX-Related Energy Quenching Sites Control Diatom Photoacclimation
<p>Marine diatoms are prominent phytoplankton organisms that perform photosynthesis in extremely variable environments. Diatoms possess a strong ability to dissipate excess absorbed energy as heat via nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). This process relies on changes in carotenoid pigment composition (xanthophyll cycle) and on specific members of the light-harvesting complex family specialized in photoprotection (LHCXs), which potentially act as NPQ effectors. However, the link between light stress, NPQ, and the existence of different LHCX isoforms is not understood in these organisms. Using picosecond fluorescence analysis, we observed two types of NPQ in the pennate diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> that were dependent on light conditions. Short exposure of low-light-acclimated cells to high light triggers the onset of energy quenching close to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> of photosystem II, while prolonged light stress activates NPQ in the antenna. Biochemical analysis indicated a link between the changes in the NPQ site/mechanism and the induction of different LHCX isoforms, which accumulate either in the antenna complexes or in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> complex. By comparing the responses of wild-type cells and transgenic lines with a reduced expression of the major LHCX isoform, LHCX1, we conclude that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> complex-associated NPQ is more effective in photoprotection than is the antenna complex. Overall, our data clarify the complex molecular scenario of light responses in diatoms and provide a rationale for the existence of a degenerate family of LHCX proteins in these algae.</p>

Stable Accumulation of Photosystem II Requires ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) of the Light Harvesting-Like Family
<p>The cellular functions of two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) one-helix proteins, OHP1 and OHP2 (also named LIGHT-HARVESTING-LIKE2 [LIL2] and LIL6, respectively, because they have sequence similarity to light-harvesting chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>-binding proteins), remain unclear. Tagged null mutants of <i>OHP1</i> and <i>OHP2</i> (<i>ohp1</i> and <i>ohp2</i>) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane proteins revealed that <i>ohp1</i> deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> protein function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> proteins; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic <i>ohp1</i> plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc proteins developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 proteins in transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid membranes, where it formed protein complexes with both OHP2 and High Chlorophyll Fluorescence244 (HCF244). We also found PSII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> proteins D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other plant-specific proteins associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly. OHP1 interacted directly with HCF244 in the complex. Therefore, OHP1 and HCF244 play important roles in the stable accumulation of PSII.</p>

Microtubule Array Patterns Have a Common Underlying Architecture in Hypocotyl Cells
<p>Microtubules at the plant cell cortex influence cell shape by patterning the deposition of cell wall materials. The elongated cells of the hypocotyl create a variety of microtubule array patterns with differing degrees of polymer coalignment and orientation to the cell’s growth axis. To gain insight into the mechanisms driving array organization, we investigated the underlying microtubule array architecture in light-grown epidermal cells with explicit reference to array pattern. We discovered that all nontransverse patterns share a common underlying array architecture, having a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> unimodal peak of coaligned microtubules in a split bipolarized arrangement. The growing microtubule plus ends extend toward the cell’s apex and base with a region of antiparallel microtubule overlap at the cell’s midzone. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> coalignment continuously shifts between ±30° from the cell’s longitudinal growth axis, forming a continuum of longitudinal and oblique arrays. Transverse arrays exhibit the same unimodal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> coalignment but form local domains of microtubules polymerizing in the same direction rather than a split bipolarized architecture. Quantitative imaging experiments and analysis of <i>katanin</i> mutants showed that the longitudinal arrays are created from microtubules originating on the outer periclinal cell face, pointing to a cell-directed, rather than self-organizing, mechanism for specifying the major array pattern classes in the hypocotyl cell.</p>

A Nitrogen-Fixing Subunit Essential for Accumulating 4Fe-4S-Containing Photosystem I Core Proteins
<p>Nitrogen-fixation-subunit-U (NFU)-type proteins have been shown to be involved in the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters. We investigated the molecular function of a chloroplastic NFU-type iron-sulfur scaffold protein, NFU3, in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using genetics approaches. Loss-of-function mutations in the <i>NFU3</i> gene caused yellow pigmentation in leaves, reductions in plant size, leaf size, and growth rate, delay in flowering and seeding, and decreases in seed production. Biochemical and physiological analyses indicated that these defects are due to the substantial reductions in the abundances of 4Fe-4S-containing photosystem I (PSI) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> subunits PsaA (where Psa stands for PSI), PsaB, and PsaC and a nearly complete loss of PSI activity. In addition to the substantial decreases in the amounts of PSI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> proteins, the content of 3Fe-4S-containing ferredoxin-dependent glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferases declined significantly in the <i>nfu3</i> mutants. Furthermore, the absorption spectrum of the recombinant NFU3 protein showed features characteristic of 4Fe-4S and 3Fe-4S clusters, and the in vitro reconstitution experiment indicated an iron-sulfur scaffold function of NFU3. These data demonstrate that NFU3 is involved in the assembly and transfer of 4Fe-4S and 3Fe-4S clusters and that NFU3 is required for the accumulation of 4Fe-4S- and 3Fe-4S-containing proteins, especially 4Fe-4S-containing PSI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> subunits, in the Arabidopsis chloroplast.</p>

Magnetic field–induced pair density wave state in the cuprate vortex halo
<p>High magnetic fields suppress cuprate superconductivity to reveal an unusual density wave (DW) state coexisting with unexplained quantum oscillations. Although routinely labeled a charge density wave (CDW), this DW state could actually be an electron-pair density wave (PDW). To search for evidence of a field-induced PDW, we visualized modulations in the density of electronic states <i>N</i>(<i>r</i>) within the halo surrounding Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> vortex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>s. We detected numerous phenomena predicted for a field-induced PDW, including two sets of particle-hole symmetric <i>N</i>(<i>r</i>) modulations with wave vectors <bold><i>Q<sub>P</sub></i></bold> and <bold>2<i>Q</i><sub>P</sub></bold>, with the latter decaying twice as rapidly from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> as the former. These data imply that the primary field-induced state in underdoped superconducting cuprates is a PDW, with approximately eight CuO<sub>2</sub> unit-cell periodicity and coexisting with its secondary CDWs.</p>

Cross-boundary human impacts compromise the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem
<p>Protected areas provide major benefits for humans in the form of ecosystem services, but landscape degradation by human activity at their edges may compromise their ecological functioning. Using multiple lines of evidence from 40 years of research in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, we find that such edge degradation has effectively “squeezed” wildlife into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> protected area and has altered the ecosystem’s dynamics even within this 40,000-square-kilometer ecosystem. This spatial cascade reduced resilience in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> and was mediated by the movement of grazers, which reduced grass fuel and fires, weakened the capacity of soils to sequester nutrients and carbon, and decreased the responsiveness of primary production to rainfall. Similar effects in other protected ecosystems worldwide may require rethinking of natural resource management outside protected areas.</p>

Compact radio emission indicates a structured jet was produced by a binary neutron star merger
<p>The binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> merger event GW170817 was detected through both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves. Its afterglow emission may have been produced by either a narrow relativistic jet or an isotropic outflow. High-spatial-resolution measurements of the source size and displacement can discriminate between these scenarios. We present very-long-baseline interferometry observations, performed 207.4 days after the merger by using a global network of 32 radio telescopes. The apparent source size is constrained to be smaller than 2.5 milli–arc seconds at the 90% confidence level. This excludes the isotropic outflow scenario, which would have produced a larger apparent size, indicating that GW170817 produced a structured relativistic jet. Our rate calculations show that at least 10% of neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> mergers produce such a jet.</p>

Evidence for Majorana bound states in an iron-based superconductor
<p>The search for Majorana bound states (MBSs) has been fueled by the prospect of using their non-Abelian statistics for robust quantum computation. Two-dimensional superconducting topological materials have been predicted to host MBSs as zero-energy modes in vortex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>s. By using scanning tunneling spectroscopy on the superconducting Dirac surface state of the iron-based superconductor FeTe<sub>0.55</sub>Se<sub>0.45</sub>, we observed a sharp zero-bias peak inside a vortex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> that does not split when moving away from the vortex center. The evolution of the peak under varying magnetic field, temperature, and tunneling barrier is consistent with the tunneling to a nearly pure MBS, separated from nontopological bound states. This observation offers a potential platform for realizing and manipulating MBSs at a relatively high temperature.</p>

Structure and dynamics of the yeast SWR1-nucleosome complex
<p>The yeast SWR1 complex exchanges histone H2A in nucleosomes with Htz1 (H2A.Z in humans). The cryo–electron microscopy structure of the SWR1 complex bound to a nucleosome at 3.6-angstrom resolution reveals details of the intricate interactions between components of the SWR1 complex and its nucleosome substrate. Interactions between the Swr1 motor domains and the DNA wrap at superhelical location 2 distort the DNA, causing a bulge with concomitant translocation of the DNA by one base pair, coupled to conformational changes of the histone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>. Furthermore, partial unwrapping of the DNA from the histone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> takes place upon binding of nucleosomes to SWR1 complex. The unwrapping, as monitored by single-molecule data, is stabilized and has its dynamics altered by adenosine triphosphate binding but does not require hydrolysis.</p>

The biosynthesis of methanobactin
<p>Metal homeostasis poses a major challenge to microbes, which must acquire scarce elements for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> metabolic processes. Methanobactin, an extensively modified copper-chelating peptide, was one of the earliest natural products shown to enable microbial acquisition of a metal other than iron. We describe the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> biosynthetic machinery responsible for the characteristic posttranslational modifications that grant methanobactin its specificity and affinity for copper. A heterodimer comprising MbnB, a DUF692 family iron enzyme, and MbnC, a protein from a previously unknown family, performs a dioxygen-dependent four-electron oxidation of the precursor peptide (MbnA) to install an oxazolone and an adjacent thioamide, the characteristic methanobactin bidentate copper ligands. MbnB and MbnC homologs are encoded together and separately in many bacterial genomes, suggesting functions beyond their roles in methanobactin biosynthesis.</p>

Rev-erbα dynamically modulates chromatin looping to control circadian gene transcription
<p>Mammalian physiology exhibits 24-hour cyclicity due to circadian rhythms of gene expression controlled by transcription factors that constitute molecular clocks. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> clock transcription factors bind to the genome at enhancer sequences to regulate circadian gene expression, but not all binding sites are equally functional. We found that in mice, circadian gene expression in the liver is controlled by rhythmic chromatin interactions between enhancers and promoters. Rev-erbα, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> repressive transcription factor of the clock, opposes functional loop formation between Rev-erbα–regulated enhancers and circadian target gene promoters by recruitment of the NCoR-HDAC3 co-repressor complex, histone deacetylation, and eviction of the elongation factor BRD4 and the looping factor MED1. Thus, a repressive arm of the molecular clock operates by rhythmically modulating chromatin loops to control circadian gene transcription.</p>

Early spectra of the gravitational wave source GW170817: Evolution of a neutron star merger
<p>On 17 August 2017, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) was discovered as the optical counterpart of the binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> gravitational wave event GW170817. We report time-series spectroscopy of SSS17a from 11.75 hours until 8.5 days after the merger. Over the first hour of observations, the ejecta rapidly expanded and cooled. Applying blackbody fits to the spectra, we measured the photosphere cooling from [Formula] to [Formula] kelvin, and determined a photospheric velocity of roughly 30% of the speed of light. The spectra of SSS17a began displaying broad features after 1.46 days and evolved qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) components. The late-time component is consistent with theoretical models of r-process–enriched neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> ejecta, whereas the blue component requires high-velocity, lanthanide-free material.</p>

Light curves of the neutron star merger GW170817/SSS17a: Implications for r-process nucleosynthesis
<p>On 17 August 2017, gravitational waves (GWs) were detected from a binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the ejection of neutron-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> mergers play a role in rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

An unusual white dwarf star may be a surviving remnant of a subluminous Type Ia supernova

We report the discovery of a high proper motion, low-mass white dwarf (LP 40-365) that travels at a velocity greater than the Galactic escape velocity and whose peculiar atmosphere is dominated by intermediate-mass elements. Strong evidence indicates that this partially burnt remnant was ejected following a subluminous Type Ia supernova event. This supports the viability of single-degenerate supernova progenitors.</p>

Two areas for familiar face recognition in the primate brain
<p>Familiarity alters face recognition: Familiar faces are recognized more accurately than unfamiliar ones and under difficult viewing conditions when unfamiliar face recognition fails. The neural basis for this fundamental difference remains unknown. Using whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that personally familiar faces engage the macaque face-processing network more than unfamiliar faces. Familiar faces also recruited two hitherto unknown face areas at anatomically conserved locations within the perirhinal cortex and the temporal pole. These two areas, but not the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> face-processing network, responded to familiar faces emerging from a blur with a characteristic nonlinear surge, akin to the abruptness of familiar face recognition. In contrast, responses to unfamiliar faces and objects remained linear. Thus, two temporal lobe areas extend the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> face-processing network into a familiar face-recognition system.</p>

Aging increases cell-to-cell transcriptional variability upon immune stimulation
<p>Aging is characterized by progressive loss of physiological and cellular functions, but the molecular basis of this decline remains unclear. We explored how aging affects transcriptional dynamics using single-cell RNA sequencing of unstimulated and stimulated naive and effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from young and old mice from two divergent species. In young animals, immunological activation drives a conserved transcriptomic switch, resulting in tightly controlled gene expression characterized by a strong up-regulation of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> activation program, coupled with a decrease in cell-to-cell variability. Aging perturbed the activation of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> program and increased expression heterogeneity across populations of cells in both species. These discoveries suggest that increased cell-to-cell transcriptional variability will be a hallmark feature of aging across most, if not all, mammalian tissues.</p>

Cryo-EM structures and atomic model of the HIV-1 strand transfer complex intasome
<p>Like all retroviruses, HIV-1 irreversibly inserts a viral DNA (vDNA) copy of its RNA genome into host target DNA (tDNA). The intasome, a higher-order nucleoprotein complex composed of viral integrase (IN) and the ends of linear vDNA, mediates integration. Productive integration into host chromatin results in the formation of the strand transfer complex (STC) containing catalytically joined vDNA and tDNA. HIV-1 intasomes have been refractory to high-resolution structural studies. We used a soluble IN fusion protein to facilitate structural studies, through which we present a high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> tetrameric HIV-1 STC and a higher-order form that adopts carboxyl-terminal domain rearrangements.

Molecular Mechanisms of Photoadaptation of Photosystem I Supercomplex from an Evolutionary Cyanobacterial/Algal Intermediate
<p>The monomeric photosystem I-light-harvesting antenna complex I (PSI-LHCI) supercomplex from the extremophilic red alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i> represents an intermediate evolutionary link between the cyanobacterial PSI reaction center and its green algal/higher plant counterpart. We show that the <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex is characterized by robustness in various extreme conditions. By a combination of biochemical, spectroscopic, mass spectrometry, and electron microscopy/single particle analyses, we dissected three molecular mechanisms underlying the inherent robustness of the <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex: (1) the accumulation of photoprotective zeaxanthin in the LHCI antenna and the PSI reaction center; (2) structural remodeling of the LHCI antenna and adjustment of the effective absorption cross section; and (3) dynamic readjustment of the stoichiometry of the two PSI-LHCI isomers and changes in the oligomeric state of the PSI-LHCI supercomplex, accompanied by dissociation of the PsaK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> subunit. We show that the largest low light-treated <i>C. merolae</i> PSI-LHCI supercomplex can bind up to eight Lhcr antenna subunits, which are organized as two rows on the PsaF/PsaJ side of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> complex. Under our experimental conditions, we found no evidence of functional coupling of the phycobilisomes with the PSI-LHCI supercomplex purified from various light conditions, suggesting that the putative association of this antenna with the PSI supercomplex is absent or may be lost during the purification procedure.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into biological systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic biology. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> flanked by translational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>t, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant biology. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Rice Cellulose SynthaseA8 Plant-Conserved Region Is a Coiled-Coil at the Catalytic Core Entrance
<p>The crystallographic structure of a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cellulose synthase, OsCesA8, plant-conserved region (P-CR), one of two unique domains in the catalytic domain of plant CesAs, was solved to 2.4 ÅÅ resolution. Two antiparallel α-helices form a coiled-coil domain linked by a large extended connector loop containing a conserved trio of aromatic residues. The P-CR structure was fit into a molecular envelope for the P-CR domain derived from small-angle X-ray scattering data. The P-CR structure and molecular envelope, combined with a homology-based chain trace of the CesA8 catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>, were modeled into a previously determined CesA8 small-angle X-ray scattering molecular envelope to produce a detailed topological model of the CesA8 catalytic domain. The predicted position for the P-CR domain from the molecular docking models places the P-CR connector loop into a hydrophobic pocket of the catalytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong>, with the coiled-coil aligned near the entrance of the substrate UDP-glucose into the active site. In this configuration, the P-CR coiled-coil alone is unlikely to regulate substrate access to the active site, but it could interact with other domains of CesA, accessory proteins, or other CesA catalytic domains to control substrate delivery.</p>

Growing evidence derived from several model organisms suggests that reduced LETM1 expression is associated with some element of mitochondrial dysfunction. Surprisingly, LETM1-dependent mitochondrial functional deficits have not previously been described in cells from individuals with WHS. Here, using a unique panel of WHS-patient-derived cell lines with deletions of differing sizes, incorporating <i>LETM1</i> or not, we show, for the first time, that LETM1 expression is reduced in mitochondria isolated from WHS-patient cells. Furthermore, we show that this is associated with distinct mitochondrial phenotypes, including altered intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] levels, dysfunctional mitochondrial transition-pore opening, hyperpolarization and superoxide leakage from resting mitochondria. Interestingly, we find that these phenotypes segregate with seizures in our WHS cohort. Our findings identify novel cellular phenotypes in WHS attributable to a 50% reduction in LETM1 expression level; these phenotypes could underlie and/or contribute to some of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> clinical features of this condition.</p>

Overexpression of the RieskeFeS Protein Increases Electron Transport Rates and Biomass Yield
<p>In this study, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants overexpressing the Rieske FeS protein (PetC), a component of the cytochrome <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> (cyt <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i>) complex. Increasing the levels of this protein resulted in concomitant increases in the levels of cyt <i>f</i> (PetA) and cyt <i>b<sub>6</sub></i> (PetB), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> proteins of the cyt <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex. Interestingly, an increase in the levels of proteins in both the photosystem I (PSI) and PSII complexes also was seen in the Rieske FeS overexpression plants. Although the mechanisms leading to these changes remain to be identified, the transgenic plants presented here provide novel tools to explore this. Importantly, overexpression of the Rieske FeS protein resulted in substantial and significant impacts on the quantum efficiency of PSI and PSII, electron transport, biomass, and seed yield in Arabidopsis plants. These results demonstrate the potential for manipulating electron transport processes to increase crop productivity.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated plant growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. Plants with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal plant growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated plant growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient availability, RCS had greater benefit in plants with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown barley in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger plants, while roots of older plants had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

Ripening Transcriptomic Program in Red and White Grapevine Varieties Correlates with Berry Skin Anthocyanin Accumulation
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) berry development involves a succession of physiological and biochemical changes reflecting the transcriptional modulation of thousands of genes. Although recent studies have investigated the dynamic transcriptome during berry development, most have focused on a single grapevine variety, so there is a lack of comparative data representing different cultivars. Here, we report, to our knowledge, the first genome-wide transcriptional analysis of 120 RNA samples corresponding to 10 Italian grapevine varieties collected at four growth stages. The 10 varieties, representing five red-skinned and five white-skinned berries, were all cultivated in the same experimental vineyard to reduce environmental variability. The comparison of transcriptional changes during berry formation and ripening allowed us to determine the transcriptomic traits common to all varieties, thus defining the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">core</span></strong> transcriptome of berry development, as well as the transcriptional dynamics underlying differences between red and white berry varieties. A greater variation among the red cultivars than between red and white cultivars at the transcriptome level was revealed, suggesting that anthocyanin accumulation during berry maturation has a direct impact on the transcriptomic regulation of multiple biological processes. The expression of genes related to phenylpropanoid/flavonoid biosynthesis clearly distinguished the behavior of red and white berry genotypes during ripening but also reflected the differential accumulation of anthocyanins in the red berries, indicating some form of cross talk between the activation of stilbene biosynthesis and the accumulation of anthocyanins in ripening berries.</p>

Generation of specific inhibitors of SUMO-1– and SUMO-2/3–mediated protein-protein interactions using Affimer (Adhiron) technology
<p>Because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions underpin most biological processes, developing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the development of therapeutics is an important task. SUMOylation is the posttranslational covalent attachment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the SUMO family (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3), and it regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are recognized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) that facilitate noncovalent interactions with SUMO. We describe the use of the Affimer system of peptide display for the rapid isolation of synthetic binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that inhibit SUMO-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions mediated by SIMs both in vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s did not prevent SUMO conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific analysis of SUMO-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions. Furthermore, through structural analysis and molecular modeling, we explored the molecular mechanisms that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO-1–mediated interactions or interactions mediated by either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Not only will these reagents enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, but the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s could also be exploited to design or validate reagents or therapeutics that target other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions.</p>

Genomics and evolution of protein phosphatases
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases are the essential opposite to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases; together, these enzymes regulate all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation and most cellular processes. To better understand the global roles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation, we cataloged the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatome, composed of 189 known and predicted human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase genes. We also identified 79 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase pseudogenes or retrogenes, some of which may have residual function. We traced the origin and diversity of phosphatases by building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatomes for eight other eukaryotes, from the protist <i>Dictyostelium</i> to the sea urchin. We classified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases from all nine species into a hierarchy of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> folds, 21 families, and 178 subfamilies. We found that >80% of the 101 human subfamilies were conserved across the animal kingdom, but show substantial differences in evolution, including losses and expansions of individual subfamilies and changes in accessory domains. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases show similar evolutionary dynamics to those of kinases, with substantial losses in major model organisms. Sequence analysis predicts that 26 human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase domains are catalytically disabled and that this disability is mostly conserved across orthologs. This genomic and evolutionary perspective on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases provides a framework for global analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation throughout the animal kingdom.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed coat mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> profiles except for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabol</span></strong>ism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s include a family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed coats, and their expression requires seed coat differentiation regulators. TBA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s to the seed coat epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain amino acids or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and 131 to bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were identified in vivo, including three key nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and 18 bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

The G Protein <i>β</i>-Subunit, AGB1, Interacts with FERONIA in RALF1-Regulated Stomatal Movement
<p>Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are composed of Gα, G<i>β</i>, and Gγ subunits and function as molecular switches in signal transduction. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are one canonical Gα (GPA1), three extra-large Gα (XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3), one G<i>β</i> (AGB1), and three Gγ (AGG1, AGG2, and AGG3) subunits. To elucidate AGB1 molecular signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation using plasma membrane-enriched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s followed by mass spectrometry to identify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactors of AGB1. After eliminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s present in the control immunoprecipitation, commonly identified contaminants, and organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, a total of 103 candidate AGB1-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were confidently identified. We identified all of the G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> subunits except XLG1, receptor-like kinases, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, and 14-3-3-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, all of which may couple with or modulate G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling. We confirmed physical interaction between AGB1 and the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) family of polypeptides have been shown to be ligands of FER. In this study, we demonstrate that RALF1 regulates stomatal apertures and does so in a G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-dependent manner, inhibiting stomatal opening and promoting stomatal closure in Columbia but not in <i>agb1</i> mutants. We further show that AGGs and XLGs, but not GPA1, participate in RALF1-mediated stomatal signaling. Our results suggest that FER acts as a G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-coupled receptor for plant heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Bioenergetics through thick and thin
<p>The cells in all biological systems are composed of a limited number of molecular constituents, mainly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, nucleic acids, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbohydr</span></strong>ates, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Of these, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s tend to receive the shortest shrift, as they are typically considered to be merely the building blocks of membranes that provide a scaffold in which the “important” molecules, such as enzymes or signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, reside. In recent years, and with the advent of advanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>omics techniques, we have learned that “a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>” is simply not true, and that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition of membranes can have profound effects on the behavior and activity of its resident macromolecules. For example, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, such as members of the phosphatidylinositol family, are important signaling molecules. However, what is less appreciated is that the physical composition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> membranes can have profound effects on cellular behavior as well. On page 1186 of this issue, Budin <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) use the Gram-negative bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> and the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as model systems to show that the fluidity of a membrane, as determined by its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, can have huge effects on the efficiency of aerobic energy production (respiration) by the highly hydrophobic, membrane-embedded, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system.</p>

Tandem Fluorescent Protein Timers for Noninvasive Relative Protein Lifetime Measurement in Plants
<p>Targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation is an important and pervasive regulatory mechanism in plants, required for perception and response to the environment as well as developmental signaling. Despite the significance of this process, relatively few studies have assessed plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in a quantitative fashion. Tandem fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> timers (tFTs) offer a powerful approach for the assessment of in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in distinct subcellular compartments of single or multiple cells. A tFT is a fusion of two different fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with distinct fluorophore maturation kinetics, which enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> age to be estimated from the ratio of fluorescence intensities of the two fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Here, we used short-lived auxin signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and model N-end rule (N-recognin) pathway reporters to demonstrate the utility of tFTs for studying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in living plant cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We present transient expression of tFTs as an efficient screen for relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> lifetime, useful for testing the effects of mutations and different genetic backgrounds on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> stability. This work demonstrates the potential for using stably expressed tFTs to study native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> dynamics with high temporal resolution in response to exogenous or endogenous stimuli.</p>

The Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein AtLtpI-4 Is Involved in Suberin Formation of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Crown Galls
<p>Nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s reversibly bind different types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> molecules in a hydrophobic cavity. They facilitate phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer between membranes in vitro, play a role in cuticle and possibly in suberin formation, and might be involved in plant pathogen defense signaling. This study focuses on the role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> <i>AtLTPI-4</i> in crown gall development. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) crown gall tumors, which develop upon infection with the virulent <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> strain C58, highly expressed <i>AtLTPI-4</i>. Crown galls of the <i>atltpI-4</i> loss-of-function mutant were much smaller compared with those of wild-type plants. The gene expression pattern and localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> to the plasma membrane pointed to a function of AtLTPI-4 in cell wall suberization. Since Arabidopsis crown galls are covered by a suberin-containing periderm instead of a cuticle, we analyzed the suberin composition of crown galls and found a reduction in the amounts of long-chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>ty acids (C<sub>18:0</sub>) in the <i>atltpI-4</i> mutant. To demonstrate the impact of AtLtpI-4 on extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, we expressed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> in Arabidopsis epidermis cells. This led to a significant increase in the very-long-chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>ty acids C<sub>24</sub> and C<sub>26</sub> in the cuticular wax fraction. Homology modeling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-overlay assays showed that AtLtpI-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> can bind these very-long-chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>ty acids. Thus, AtLtpI-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> may facilitate the transfer of long-chain as well as very-long-chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>ty acids into the apoplast, depending on the cell type in which it is expressed. In crown galls, which endogenously express AtLtpI-4, it is involved in suberin formation.</p>

The PA<sup>+</sup> groups significantly increased the metabolic equivalents per week versus the PA<sup>−</sup> groups (19.0 versus 2.1; <i>P</i>=0.009). Whereas final moderate weight loss was indifferent, exercise attenuated the waist circumference rebound with the greatest effect in the MED/LC<sup>PA+</sup> group (<i>P</i><0.05). VAT (−22%), intrahepatic (−29%), and intrapericardial (−11%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>s declines were higher than pancreatic and femur intermuscular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>s (1% to 2%) loss. Independent of weight loss, PA<sup>+</sup> with either diet had a significantly greater effect on decreasing VAT (mean of difference, −6.67cm<sup>2</sup>; 95% confidence interval, −14.8 to −0.45) compared with PA<sup>−</sup>.

In multivariate models further adjusted for weight loss, losing VAT or intrahepatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> was independently associated with improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> profile, losing deep subcutaneous adipose tissue with improved insulin sensitivity, and losing superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue remained neutral except for an association with decreased leptin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Moderate weight loss alone inadequately reflects the significant lifestyle effects on atherogenic and diabetogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> depots.

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s (glycerides, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>ty acids, phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, lysophospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, and galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s into the fragmentation of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s.

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes damage to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and DNA. Antioxidants, like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as antioxidants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s versus carotenoids as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s only. This study shows that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong>s could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib.

Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s changed significantly with torcetrapib.

Saltational evolution of the heterotrimeric G protein signaling mechanisms in the plant kingdom
<p>Signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s evolved diverse interactions to provide specificity for distinct stimuli. Signaling complexity in the G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> (heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate–binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>) network was achieved in animals through subunit duplication and incremental evolution. By combining comprehensive and quantitative phenotypic profiles of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> evolution informatics, we found that plant heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> machinery evolved by a saltational (jumping) process. Sequence similarity scores mapped onto tertiary structures, and biochemical validation showed that the extra-large Gα (XLG) subunit evolved extensively in the charophycean algae (an aquatic green plant) by gene duplication and gene fusion. In terrestrial plants, further evolution uncoupled XLG from its negative regulator, regulator of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling, but preserved an α-helix region that enables interaction with its partner Gβγ. The ancestral gene evolved slowly due to the molecular constraints imposed by the need for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> to maintain interactions with various partners, whereas the genes encoding XLG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s evolved rapidly to produce three highly divergent members. Analysis of <i>A. thaliana</i> mutants indicated that these Gα and XLG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s all function with Gβγ and evolved to operate both independently and cooperatively. The XLG-Gβγ machinery specialized in environmental stress responses, whereas the canonical Gα-Gβγ retained developmental roles. Some developmental processes, such as shoot development, involve both Gα and XLG acting cooperatively or antagonistically. These extensive and rapid evolutionary changes in XLG structure compared to those of the canonical Gα subunit contrast with the accepted notion of how pathway diversification occurs through gene duplication with subsequent incremental coevolution of residues among interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the phosphates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional phosphate group to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A negative charge. Our findings demonstrate how bacteria tailor their cell surface to different stresses, such as those faced inside phagocytes.</p>

Multisite phosphorylation by MAPK
<p>Reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in signal transduction networks. Phosphorylation alters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function by regulating enzymatic activity, stability, cellular localization, or binding partners. Over three-quarters of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s may be phosphorylated, with many targeted at multiple sites. Such multisite phosphorylation substantially increases the scope for modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function—a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> with <i>n</i> phosphorylation sites has the potential to exist in 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> distinct phosphorylation states, each of which could, in theory, display modified functionality. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s can be substrates for several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases, thereby integrating distinct signals to provide a coherent biological response. However, they can also be phosphorylated at multiple sites by a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase to promote a specific functional output that can be reversed by dephosphorylation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases. On page 233 of this issue, Mylona <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal an unexpected role for multisite phosphorylation, whereby a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase progressively phosphorylates sites on a transcription factor to promote and then subsequently limit its activity independently of dephosphorylation.</p>

Stable Accumulation of Photosystem II Requires ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) of the Light Harvesting-Like Family
<p>The cellular functions of two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) one-helix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, OHP1 and OHP2 (also named LIGHT-HARVESTING-LIKE2 [LIL2] and LIL6, respectively, because they have sequence similarity to light-harvesting chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s), remain unclear. Tagged null mutants of <i>OHP1</i> and <i>OHP2</i> (<i>ohp1</i> and <i>ohp2</i>) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s revealed that <i>ohp1</i> deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic <i>ohp1</i> plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid membranes, where it formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complexes with both OHP2 and High Chlorophyll Fluorescence244 (HCF244). We also found PSII core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other plant-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly. OHP1 interacted directly with HCF244 in the complex. Therefore, OHP1 and HCF244 play important roles in the stable accumulation of PSII.</p>

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts
<p>Chloroplasts import many pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that can be classified based on their physicochemical properties. The cleavable N-terminal transit peptide (TP) of chloroplast pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s contains all the information required for import into chloroplasts through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of whether and how the physicochemical properties of pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s affect TP-mediated import into chloroplasts has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient translocation through the chloroplast envelope membranes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s containing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s prone to aggregation. By contrast, the translocation of soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s through the chloroplast envelope membranes is less dependent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation into chloroplasts; instead, these mutant TPs led to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> mistargeting to the chloroplast envelope membranes or nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> aggregation during import into chloroplasts. The mistargeting of TMD-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation is compromised. We propose that the physicochemical properties of chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation through the chloroplast envelope, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient translocation of TMD-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> family, which also includes the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction, and integration of interacting partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are much larger than the bacterial BcsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, prompting the suggestion that these plant-specific regions are important for interactions between CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and for conferring CESA class specificity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and hence what determines the specificity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class specificity extends throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site specificity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

Proximity biotinylation identifies a set of conformation-specific interactions between Merlin and cell junction proteins
<p>Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited, neoplastic disease associated with schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas and that is caused by inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene <i>NF2</i>. The <i>NF2</i> gene product, Merlin, has no intrinsic catalytic activity; its tumor suppressor function is mediated through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with which it interacts. We used proximity biotinylation followed by mass spectrometry and direct binding assays to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that associated with wild-type and various mutant forms of Merlin in immortalized Schwann cells. We defined a set of 52 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in close proximity to wild-type Merlin. Most of the Merlin-proximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were components of cell junctional signaling complexes, suggesting that additional potential interaction partners may exist in adherens junctions, tight junctions, and focal adhesions. With mutant forms of Merlin that cannot bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) or that constitutively adopt a closed conformation, we confirmed a critical role for PIP<sub>2</sub> binding in Merlin function and identified a large cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that specifically interacted with Merlin in the closed conformation. Among these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, we identified a previously unreported Merlin-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, apoptosis-stimulated p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 2 (ASPP2, also called Tp53bp2), that bound to closed-conformation Merlin predominately through the FERM domain.

“Disruptor” residues in the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) R12 subfamily attenuate the inactivation of Gα subunits

RGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are classified into four subfamilies (R4, R7, RZ, and R12) and function as negative regulators of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling by inactivating Gα subunits. We found that the R12 subfamily members RGS10 and RGS14 had lower activity than most R4 subfamily members toward the G<sub>i</sub> subfamily member Gα<sub>o</sub>. Using structure-based energy calculations with multiple Gα-RGS complexes, we identified R12-specific residues in positions that are predicted to determine the divergent activity of this subfamily. This analysis predicted that these residues, which we call “disruptor residues,” interact with the Gα helical domain. We engineered the R12 disruptor residues into the RGS domains of the high-activity R4 subfamily and found that these altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s exhibited reduced activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Reciprocally, replacing the putative disruptor residues in RGS18 (a member of the R4 subfamily that exhibited low activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>) with the corresponding residues from a high-activity R4 subfamily RGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> increased its activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Furthermore, the high activity of the R4 subfamily toward Gα<sub>o</sub> was independent of the residues in the homologous positions to the R12 subfamily and RGS18 disruptor residues. Thus, our results suggest that the identified RGS disruptor residues function as negative design elements that attenuate RGS activity for specific Gα <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Aurora B opposes PP1 function in mitosis by phosphorylating the conserved PP1-binding RVxF motif in PP1 regulatory proteins
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a highly conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase that performs most of the serine- and threonine-dephosphorylation reactions in eukaryotes and opposes the actions of a diverse set of serine and threonine (Ser-Thr) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases. PP1 gains substrate specificity through binding to a large number (>200) of regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that control PP1 localization, activity, and interactions with substrates. PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF binding motif that is present in many of these regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes. We showed that a subset of the RVxF binding motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable amino acid (RV[S/T]F), was phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily governed by the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites maintained the phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis by disrupting the assembly of PP1 holoenzymes. We generated an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s (KNL1, CDCA2, and RIF1) and multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that could potentially act as PP1 binding partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1, and ELYS) governed by this mechanism. Together, these data suggest a general regulatory mechanism by which the coordinated activities of Aurora B and PP1 control mitotic progression.</p>

We combined computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo designed mini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, 1000 natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences.

Iteration between design and experiment increased the design success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s unlike those found in nature for topologies where design was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as designs became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> design into a data-driven science.</p>

HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation
<p>Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is coproduced with ethylene in plant cells and is primarily enzymatically detoxified by the mitochondrial β-CYANOALANINE SYNTHASE (CAS-C1). Permanent or transient depletion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alterations in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> content, identifying 451 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that are absent or less abundant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that are only present or more abundant in <i>cas-c1</i>. Gene ontology classification of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s identified proteomic changes that explain the root hairless phenotype and the altered immune response observed in the <i>cas-c1</i> mutant. The mechanism of action of cyanide as a signaling molecule was addressed using two proteomic approaches aimed at identifying the <i>S-</i>cyanylation of Cys as a posttranslational modification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Both the 2-imino-thiazolidine chemical method and the direct untargeted analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified a set of 163 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s susceptible to <i>S-</i>cyanylation that included SEDOHEPTULOSE 1,7-BISPHOSPHATASE (SBPase), the PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE 20-3 (CYP20-3), and ENOLASE2 (ENO2). In vitro analysis of these enzymes showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation of SBPase Cys<sup>74</sup>, CYP20-3 Cys<sup>259</sup>, and ENO2 Cys<sup>346</sup> residues affected their enzymatic activity. Gene Ontology classification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction cluster analysis showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation is involved in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, and the Calvin and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met cycles.</p>

Revisiting the Algal “Chloroplast Lipid Droplet”: The Absence of an Entity That Is Unlikely to Exist
<p>The precise localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets and the metabolic pathways associated with oil production are crucial to the engineering of microalgae for biofuel production. Several studies have reported detecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets within the chloroplast of the microalga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, which accumulates considerable amounts of triacylglycerol and starch within the cell under nitrogen deprivation or high-light stress conditions. Starch undoubtedly accumulates within the chloroplast, but there have been debates on the localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets, which are cytosolic organelles in other organisms. Although it is impossible to prove an absence, we tried to repeat experiments that previously indicated the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets in chloroplasts. Here, we present microscopic results showing no evidence for the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets within the chloroplast stroma, even though some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets existed in close association with the chloroplast or were largely engulfed by the chloroplasts. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets are cytosolic structures, distinct from the plastoglobules present in the chloroplast stroma. These results not only contrast with the old ideas but also point out that what were previously thought to be chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets are likely to be embedded within chloroplast invaginations in association with the outer envelope of the chloroplast without intervention of the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings point to the intriguing possibility of a tight metabolic flow from the chloroplast to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplet through a close association rather than direct contact of both organelles.</p>

<i>Small kernel2</i> Encodes a Glutaminase in Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis Essential for Maize Seed Development
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub>, an essential cofactor for a range of biochemical reactions and a potent antioxidant, plays important roles in plant growth, development, and stress tolerance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub> deficiency causes embryo lethality in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but the specific role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis in endosperm development has not been fully addressed, especially in monocot crops, where endosperm constitutes the major portion of the grain. Through molecular characterization of a <i>small kernel2</i> (<i>smk2</i>) mutant in maize, we reveal that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub> has differential effects on embryogenesis and endosperm development in maize. The B<sub>6</sub> vitamer pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) is drastically reduced in both the <i>smk2</i> embryo and the endosperm. However, whereas embryogenesis of the <i>smk2</i> mutant is arrested at the transition stage, endosperm formation is nearly normal. Cloning reveals that <i>Smk2</i> encodes the glutaminase subunit of the PLP synthase complex involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis de novo. <i>Smk2</i> partially complements the Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub>-deficient mutant <i>pdx2.1</i> and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> pyridoxine auxotrophic mutant MML21. <i>Smk2</i> is constitutively expressed in the maize plant, including developing embryos. Analysis of B<sub>6</sub> vitamers indicates that the endosperm accumulates a large amount of pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP). These results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub> is essential to embryogenesis but has a reduced role in endosperm development in maize. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub> required for seed development is synthesized in the seed, and the endosperm accumulates PMP probably as a storage form of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vitamin</span></strong> B<sub>6</sub>.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis in oil seeds is still not fully understood. Oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> distribution profiles observed imply differential regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabol</span></strong>ism between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oilseed rape productivity and quality.</p>

Glycerolipid Characterization and Nutrient Deprivation-Associated Changes in the Green Picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i>
<p>The picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i> is a minimal photosynthetic eukaryote that has been used as a model system. <i>O. tauri</i> is known to efficiently produce docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We provide a comprehensive study of the glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>ome of <i>O. tauri</i> and validate this species as model for related picoeukaryotes. <i>O. tauri</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s displayed unique features that combined traits from the green and the chromalveolate lineages. The betaine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> diacylglyceryl-hydroxymethyl-trimethyl-β-alanine and phosphatidyldimethylpropanethiol, both hallmarks of chromalveolates, were identified as presumed extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. DHA was confined to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, while plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s of prokaryotic type were characterized by the overwhelming presence of ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>ty acids (FAs), 18:5 being restricted to galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. C16:4, an FA typical of green microalgae galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, also was a major component of <i>O. tauri</i> extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, while the 16:4-coenzyme A (CoA) species was not detected. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) displayed the complete panel of FAs, and many species exhibited combinations of FAs diagnostic for plastidial and extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Importantly, under nutrient deprivation, 16:4 and ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated FAs accumulated into de novo synthesized TAGs while DHA-TAG species remained rather stable, indicating an increased contribution of FAs of plastidial origin to TAG synthesis. Nutrient deprivation further severely down-regulated the conversion of 18:3 to 18:4, resulting in obvious inversion of the 18:3/18:4 ratio in plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, TAGs, as well as acyl-CoAs. The fine-tuned and dynamic regulation of the 18:3/18:4 ratio suggested an important physiological role of these FAs in photosynthetic membranes. Acyl position in structural and storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s together with acyl-CoA analysis further help to determine mechanisms possibly involved in glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis.</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three cone photoreceptor classes for colour vision, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. Screening pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> that, like humans, lack screening pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> require four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> might possess fewer than four cone classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction.</p>

IRE1α prevents hepatic steatosis by processing and promoting the degradation of select microRNAs
<p>Obesity or a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> diet represses the endoribonuclease activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), a transducer of the unfolded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> response (UPR) in cells under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. An impaired UPR is associated with hepatic steatosis and nonalcoholic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>ty liver disease (NAFLD), which is caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation in the liver. We found that IRE1α was critical to maintaining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> homeostasis in the liver by repressing the biogenesis of microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> mobilization. In mice fed normal chow, the endoribonuclease function of IRE1α processed a subset of precursor miRNAs in the liver, including those of the miR-200 and miR-34 families, such that IRE1α promoted their degradation through the process of regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). A high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong> diet in mice or hepatic steatosis in patients was associated with the S-nitrosylation of IRE1α and inactivation of its endoribonuclease activity. This resulted in an increased abundance of these miRNA families in the liver and, consequently, a decreased abundance of their targets, which included peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α (PPARα) and the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>ty acid oxidation and triglyceride lipolysis. IRE1α deficiency exacerbated hepatic steatosis in mice. The abundance of the miR-200 and miR-34 families was also increased in cultured, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-overloaded hepatocytes and in the livers of patients with hepatic steatosis. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which IRE1α maintains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> homeostasis through its regulation of miRNAs, a regulatory pathway distinct from the canonical IRE1α-UPR pathway under acute ER stress.</p>

Thermal proximity coaggregation for system-wide profiling of protein complex dynamics in cells

Modulating Protein Stability to Switch Toxic Protein Function On and Off in Living Cells
<p>Toxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are prime targets for molecular farming (the generation of pharmacologically active or biotechnologically usable compounds in plants) and are also efficient tools for targeted cell ablation in genetics, developmental biology, and biotechnology. However, achieving conditional activity of cytotoxins and maintaining the toxin-expressing plants as stably transformed lines remain challenging. Here, we produce a switchable version of the highly cytotoxic bacterial RNase barnase by fusing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> to a portable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation cassette, the low-temperature degron cassette. This method allows conditional genetics based on conditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation via the N-end rule or N-degron pathway and has been used to vice versa accumulate and/or deplete a diverse variety of highly active, unstable or stable target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in different living multicellular organisms and cell systems. Moreover, we expressed the barnase fusion under control of the trichome-specific <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> promoter. This enabled efficient temperature-dependent control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> accumulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf hairs (trichomes). By tuning the levels of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, we were able to control the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fat</span></strong>e of trichomes in vivo. The on-demand formation of trichomes through manipulating the balance between stabilization and destabilization of barnase provides proof of concept for a robust and powerful tool for conditional switchable cell arrest. We present this tool as a potential strategy for the manufacture and accumulation of cytotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and toxic high-value products in plants or for conditional genetic cell ablation.</p>

CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED Supports Translation under Stress and Interacts with the Ribosomal 30S Subunit
<p>Chloroplast ribosomes, which originated from cyanobacteria, comprise a large subunit (50S) and a small subunit (30S) containing ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and various ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Genes for many chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with auxiliary roles in ribosome biogenesis or functioning, reside in the nucleus. Here, we identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED (CRASS), a member of the latter class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, based on the tight coexpression of its mRNA with transcripts for nucleus-encoded chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. CRASS was acquired during the evolution of embryophytes and is localized to the chloroplast stroma. Loss of CRASS results in minor defects in development, photosynthetic efficiency, and chloroplast translation activity under controlled growth conditions, but these phenotypes are greatly exacerbated under stress conditions induced by the translational inhibitors lincomycin and chloramphenicol or by cold treatment. The CRASS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> comigrates with chloroplast ribosomal particles and coimmunoprecipitates with the 16S rRNA and several chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, particularly the plastid ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s of the 30S subunit (PRPS1 and PRPS5). The association of CRASS with PRPS1 and PRPS5 is independent of rRNA and is not detectable in yeast two-hybrid experiments, implying that either CRASS interacts indirectly with PRPS1 and PRPS5 via another component of the small ribosomal subunit or that it recognizes structural features of the multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>/rRNA particle. CRASS plays a role in the biogenesis and/or stability of the chloroplast ribosome that becomes critical under certain stressful conditions when ribosomal activity is compromised.</p>

<i>Medicago</i> Plants Control Nodulation by Regulating Proteolysis of the Receptor-Like Kinase DMI2
<p>Plants use receptor-like kinases to monitor environmental changes and transduce signals into plant cells. The <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (hereafter <i>M</i>. <i>truncatula</i>) DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS2 (DMI2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> functions as a coreceptor of rhizobial signals to initiate nodule development and rhizobial infection during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, but the mechanisms regulating DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> level and folding are still unknown. Here, we report that DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> abundance changes during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. DMI2 accumulates in the nodules and is induced by rhizobia treatment through a posttranscriptional process. However, DMI2 induction is independent of the perception of Nod factor, a group of lipochitooligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia. The stability of the DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> is controlled by the proteasome pathway: in rhizobia-free environments, DMI2 is degraded by the proteasome, but during rhizobial infection, DMI2 is protected from the proteasome, resulting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> accumulation. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor-promoted accumulation of DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> in <i>Medicago</i> roots induces the expression of two early nodulation marker genes, supporting the hypothesis that DMI2 accumulation activates downstream symbiosis signaling. The extracellular region of DMI2 contains two malectin-like domains (MLDs) and a leucine-rich repeat. When conserved amino acids in the MLDs are mutated, DMI2 fails to restore nodule development in <i>dmi2</i> mutants, and point-mutated MLD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are degraded constitutively, suggesting that the MLD may be vital for the accumulation of DMI2. Our findings suggest that legumes control nodule development through modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> level of DMI2, revealing a layer of regulation in the interaction between plants and rhizobia in nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.</p>

<p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a major defense signal in plants. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the chloroplast-localized isochorismate pathway is the main source of SA biosynthesis during abiotic stress or pathogen infections. In the first step of the pathway, the enzyme ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 (ICS1) converts chorismate to isochorismate. An unknown enzyme subsequently converts isochorismate to SA. Here, we show that ICS1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels increase during UV-C stress. To identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that may play roles in SA production by regulating ICS1, we analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that coimmunoprecipitated with ICS1 via mass spectrometry. The ICS1 complexes contained a large number of peptides from the PROHIBITIN (PHB) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> family, with PHB3 the most abundant. PHB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s have diverse biological functions that include acting as scaffolds for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complex formation and stabilization. PHB3 was reported previously to localize to mitochondria. Using fractionation, protease protection, and live imaging, we show that PHB3 also localizes to chloroplasts, where ICS1 resides. Notably, loss of PHB3 function led to decreased ICS1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels in response to UV-C stress. However, <i>ICS1</i> transcript levels remain unchanged, indicating that ICS1 is regulated posttranscriptionally. The <i>phb3</i> mutant displayed reduced levels of SA, the SA-regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> PR1, and hypersensitive cell death in response to UV-C and avirulent strains of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and, correspondingly, supported increased growth of <i>P. syringae</i>. The expression of a <i>PHB3</i> transgene in the <i>phb3</i> mutant complemented all of these phenotypes. We suggest a model in which the formation of PHB3-ICS1 complexes stabilizes ICS1 to promote SA production in response to stress.</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als and the control that the leaf exerts over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al distribution that is preserved in different environments. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

The Prenylated Rab GTPase Receptor PRA1.F4 Contributes to Protein Exit from the Golgi Apparatus
<p>Prenylated Rab acceptor1 (PRA1) functions in the recruitment of prenylated Rab <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s to their cognate organelles. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains a large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s belonging to the AtPRA1 family. However, their physiological roles remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the physiological role of AtPRA1.F4, a member of the AtPRA1 family. A T-DNA insertion knockdown mutant of <i>AtPRA1.F4</i>, <i>atpra1.f4</i>, was smaller in stature than parent plants and possessed shorter roots, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing HA:AtPRA1.F4 showed enhanced development of secondary roots and root hairs. However, both overexpression and knockdown plants exhibited increased sensitivity to high-salt stress, lower vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and plasma membrane ATPase activities, lower and higher pH in the vacuole and apoplast, respectively, and highly vesiculated Golgi apparatus. HA:AtPRA1.F4 localized to the Golgi apparatus and assembled into high-molecular-weight complexes. <i>atpra1.f4</i> plants displayed a defect in vacuolar trafficking, which was complemented by low but not high levels of <i>HA</i>:<i>AtPRA1.F4</i>. Overexpression of HA:AtPRA1.F4 also inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> trafficking at the Golgi apparatus, albeit differentially depending on the final destination or type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>: trafficking of vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, plasma membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, and trans-Golgi network (TGN)-localized SYP61 was strongly inhibited; trafficking of TGN-localized SYP51 was slightly inhibited; and trafficking of secretory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and TGN-localized SYP41 was negligibly or not significantly inhibited. Based on these results, we propose that Golgi-localized AtPRA1.F4 is involved in the exit of many but not all types of post-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s from the Golgi apparatus. Additionally, an appropriate level of AtPRA1.F4 is crucial for its function at the Golgi apparatus.</p>

Pipeline to Identify Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoproteins
<p>Intrinsically disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s (IDPs) are functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure. The study of IDPs is a rapidly growing area as the crucial biological functions of more of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are uncovered. In plants, IDPs are implicated in plant stress responses, signaling, and regulatory processes. A superfamily of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, the hydroxyproline-rich glyco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s (HRGPs), have characteristic features of IDPs. Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> backbones are rich in the disordering amino acid proline, they contain repeated sequence motifs and extensive posttranslational modifications (glycosylation), and they have been implicated in many biological functions. HRGPs are evolutionarily ancient, having been isolated from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-rich walls of chlorophyte algae to the cellulose-rich walls of embryophytes. Examination of HRGPs in a range of plant species should provide valuable insights into how they have evolved. Commonly divided into the arabinogalactan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, extensins, and proline-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, in reality, a continuum of structures exists within this diverse and heterogenous superfamily. An inability to accurately classify HRGPs leads to inconsistent gene ontologies limiting the identification of HRGP classes in existing and emerging omics data sets. We present a novel and robust motif and amino acid bias (MAAB) bioinformatics pipeline to classify HRGPs into 23 descriptive subclasses. Validation of MAAB was achieved using available genomic resources and then applied to the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (<ext-link>www.onekp.com</ext-link>) data set. Significant improvement in the detection of HRGPs using multiple-<i>k-</i>mer transcriptome assembly methodology was observed. The MAAB pipeline is readily adaptable and can be modified to optimize the recovery of IDPs from other organisms.</p>

Activation of Mitochondrial Protein Phosphatase SLP2 by MIA40 Regulates Seed Germination
<p>Reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation catalyzed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases and phosphatases represents the most prolific and well-characterized posttranslational modification known. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>Shewanella</i>-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase 2 (AtSLP2) is a bona fide Ser/Thr <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase that is targeted to the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) where it interacts with the mitochondrial oxidoreductase import and assembly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 40 (AtMIA40), forming a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complex. Interaction with AtMIA40 is necessary for the phosphatase activity of AtSLP2 and is dependent on the formation of disulfide bridges on AtSLP2. Furthermore, by utilizing <i>atslp2</i> null mutant, AtSLP2 complemented and AtSLP2 overexpressing plants, we identify a function for the AtSLP2-AtMIA40 complex in negatively regulating gibberellic acid-related processes during seed germination. Results presented here characterize a mitochondrial IMS-localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase identified in photosynthetic eukaryotes as well as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase target of the highly conserved eukaryotic MIA40 IMS oxidoreductase.</p>

Membrane Proteomic Insights into the Physiology and Taxonomy of an Oleaginous Green Microalga
<p><i>Ettlia</i> <i>oleoabundans</i> is a nonsequenced oleaginous green microalga. Despite the significant biotechnological interest in producing value-added compounds from the acyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s of this microalga, a basic understanding of the physiology and biochemistry of oleaginous microalgae is lacking, especially under nitrogen deprivation conditions known to trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation. Using an RNA sequencing-based proteomics approach together with manual annotation, we are able to provide, to our knowledge, the first membrane proteome of an oleaginous microalga. This approach allowed the identification of novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in <i>E. oleoabundans</i>, including two photoprotection-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, Photosystem II Subunit S and Maintenance of Photosystem II under High Light1, which were considered exclusive to higher photosynthetic organisms, as well as Retinitis Pigmentosa Type 2-Clathrin Light Chain, a membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> with a novel domain architecture. Free-flow zonal electrophoresis of microalgal membranes coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proved to be a useful technique for determining the intracellular location of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s of interest. Carbon-flow compartmentalization in <i>E. oleoabundans</i> was modeled using this information. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> markers and 18S ribosomal DNA support the reclassification of <i>E. oleoabundans</i> within the trebouxiophycean microalgae, rather than with the Chlorophyceae class, in which it is currently classified, indicating that it may not be closely related to the model green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. A detailed survey of biological processes taking place in the membranes of nitrogen-deprived <i>E. oleoabundans</i>, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabol</span></strong>ism, provides insights into the basic biology of this nonmodel organism.</p>

Claudin-6, -10d and -10e contribute to seawater acclimation in the euryhaline puffer fish <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i>
<p>Expression profiles of <i>claudin-6, -10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> in the euryhaline teleost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i> revealed <i>claudin-6</i> in brain, eye, gill and skin tissue, while <i>claudin-10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> were found in brain, gill and skin only. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>es, the gill and skin are important tissue barriers that interface directly with surrounding water, but these organs generally function differently in osmoregulation. Therefore, roles for gill and skin claudin-6, -10d and -10e in the osmoregulatory strategies of <i>T. nigroviridis</i> were investigated. In the gill epithelium, claudin-6, -10d and -10e co-localized with Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase immunoreactive (NKA-ir) ionocytes, and differences in sub-cellular localization could be observed in hypoosmotic (freshwater, FW) versus hyperosmotic (seawater, SW) environments. Claudin-10d and -10e abundance increased in the gills of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> acclimated to SW versus FW, while claudin-6 abundance decreased in the gills of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> acclimated to SW. Taken together with our knowledge of claudin-6 and -10 function in other vertebrates, data support the idea that in SW-acclimated <i>T. nigroviridis</i>, these claudins are abundant in gill ionocytes, where they contribute to the formation of a Na<sup>+</sup> shunt and ‘leaky’ epithelium, both of which are characteristic of salt-secreting SW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> gills. Skin claudin-10d and -10e abundance also increased in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> acclimated to SW versus those in FW, but so did claudin-6. In skin, claudin-6 was found to co-localize with NKA-ir cells, but claudin-10d and -10e did not. This study provides direct evidence that the gill epithelium contains salinity-responsive tight junction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that are abundant primarily in ionocytes. These same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s also appear to play a role in the osmoregulatory physiology of the epidermis.</p>

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome

To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular disease pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously.

CaMKII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> abundance was increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (<i>P</i><0.001). The CaMKII target pT17-phospholamban was 5.5-fold increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (<i>P</i>=0.01), as was autophosphorylated CaMKII (<i>P</i><0.01), suggestive of constitutive activation. Calcineurin (<i>PPP3CB</i>) mRNA was not increased, nor was <i>RCAN1</i> mRNA level, indicating a lack of calcineurin activation.

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> production system, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>-producing system or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>-producing system or in the vocal motor network. We recorded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>-producing system. We suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> production system demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s and the energetic consequences of modifying these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic cost of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic cost of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

The limits of applicability of the sound exposure level (SEL) metric to temporal threshold shifts (TTS) in beluga whales, <i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>
<p>The influence of fatiguing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> level and duration on post-exposure temporary threshold shift (TTS) was investigated in two beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>). The fatiguing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> was half-octave noise with a center frequency of 22.5 kHz. TTS was measured at a test frequency of 32 kHz. Thresholds were measured by recording rhythmic evoked potentials (the envelope following response) to a test series of short (eight cycles) tone pips with a pip rate of 1000 s<sup>−1</sup>. TTS increased approximately proportionally to the dB measure of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> pressure (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> pressure level, SPL) and duration of the fatiguing noise, as a product of these two variables. In particular, when the noise parameters varied in a manner that maintained the product of squared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> pressure and time (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> exposure level, SEL, which is equivalent to the overall noise energy) at a constant level, TTS was not constant. Keeping SEL constant, the highest TTS appeared at an intermediate ratio of SPL to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> duration and decreased at both higher and lower ratios. Multiplication (SPL multiplied by log duration) better described the experimental data than an equal-energy (equal SEL) model. The use of SEL as a sole universal metric may result in an implausible assessment of the impact of a fatiguing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> on hearing thresholds in odontocetes, including under-evaluation of potential risks.</p>

Observation of second sound in graphite at temperatures above 100 K
<p>Wavelike thermal transport in solids, referred to as second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>, is an exotic phenomenon previously limited to a handful of materials at low temperatures. The rare occurrence of this effect restricted its scientific and practical importance. We directly observed second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> in graphite at temperatures above 100 kelvins by using time-resolved optical measurements of thermal transport on the micrometer-length scale. Our experimental results are in qualitative agreement with ab initio calculations that predict wavelike phonon hydrodynamics. We believe that these results potentially indicate an important role of second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> in microscale transient heat transport in two-dimensional and layered materials in a wide temperature range.</p>

Noise pollution is pervasive in U.S. protected areas
<p>Anthropogenic noise threatens ecological systems, including the cultural and biodiversity resources in protected areas. Using continental-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> models, we found that anthropogenic noise doubled background <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> levels in 63% of U.S. protected area units and caused a 10-fold or greater increase in 21%, surpassing levels known to interfere with human visitor experience and disrupt wildlife behavior, fitness, and community composition. Elevated noise was also found in critical habitats of endangered species, with 14% experiencing a 10-fold increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> levels. However, protected areas with more stringent regulations had less anthropogenic noise. Our analysis indicates that noise pollution in protected areas is closely linked with transportation, development, and extractive land use, providing insight into where mitigation efforts can be most effective.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle motion, with particle motion dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle motion component of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> source localisation.</p>

Measurement of a superconducting qubit with a microwave photon counter
<p>Fast, high-fidelity measurement is a key ingredient for quantum error correction. Conventional approaches to the measurement of superconducting qubits, involving linear amplification of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>e probe tone followed by heterodyne detection at room temperature, do not scale well to large system sizes. We introduce an approach to measurement based on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>e photon counter demonstrating raw single-shot measurement fidelity of 92%. Moreover, the intrinsic damping of the photon counter is used to extract the energy released by the measurement process, allowing repeated high-fidelity quantum nondemolition measurements. Our scheme provides access to the classical outcome of projective quantum measurement at the millikelvin stage and could form the basis for a scalable quantum-to-classical interface.</p>

Brain scientists dive into deep neural networks
<p>At the Conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience this month, researchers presented new tools for comparing data collected from living brains with readouts from computational models known as deep neural networks. Such comparisons might offer up new hypotheses about how humans interpret sights and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s, understand language, or navigate the world. Until recently, artificial intelligence couldn't come anywhere close to human performance on tasks like recognizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s or classifying images. But deep neural networks, loosely inspired by the brain, have logged increasingly impressive performances, especially on visual tasks. That has led some neuroscientists to wonder whether these models could yield insight into how our own brains process information.</p>

Strong spin-photon coupling in silicon
<p>Long coherence times of single spins in silicon quantum dots make these systems highly attractive for quantum computation, but how to scale up spin qubit systems remains an open question. As a first step to address this issue, we demonstrate the strong coupling of a single electron spin and a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>e photon. The electron spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>e photon is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric field component of the cavity photon couples directly to the charge dipole of the electron in the double dot, and indirectly to the electron spin, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet. Our results provide a route to realizing large networks of quantum dot–based spin qubit registers.</p>

Jupiter’s interior and deep atmosphere: The initial pole-to-pole passes with the Juno spacecraft
<p>On 27 August 2016, the Juno spacecraft acquired science observations of Jupiter, passing less than 5000 kilometers above the equatorial cloud tops. Images of Jupiter’s poles show a chaotic scene, unlike Saturn’s poles. Microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>ing reveals weather features at pressures deeper than 100 bars, dominated by an ammonia-rich, narrow low-latitude plume resembling a deeper, wider version of Earth’s Hadley cell. Near-infrared mapping reveals the relative humidity within prominent downwelling regions. Juno’s measured gravity field differs substantially from the last available estimate and is one order of magnitude more precise. This has implications for the distribution of heavy elements in the interior, including the existence and mass of Jupiter’s core. The observed magnetic field exhibits smaller spatial variations than expected, indicative of a rich harmonic content.</p>

Demonstration of an ac Josephson junction laser
<p>Superconducting electronic devices have reemerged as contenders for both classical and quantum computing due to their fast operation speeds, low dissipation, and long coherence times. An ultimate demonstration of coherence is lasing. We use one of the fundamental aspects of superconductivity, the ac Josephson effect, to demonstrate a laser made from a Josephson junction strongly coupled to a multimode superconducting cavity. A dc voltage bias applied across the junction provides a source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>e photons, and the circuit’s nonlinearity allows for efficient down-conversion of higher-order Josephson frequencies to the cavity’s fundamental mode. The simple fabrication and operation allows for easy integration with a range of quantum devices, allowing for efficient on-chip generation of coherent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>e photons at low temperatures.</p>

High-quality graphene via microwave reduction of solution-exfoliated graphene oxide
<p>Efficient exfoliation of graphite in solutions to obtain high-quality graphene flakes is desirable for printable electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and composites. Graphite oxide with large lateral dimensions has an exfoliation yield of ~100%, but it has not been possible to completely remove the oxygen functional groups so that the reduced form of graphene oxide (GO; reduced form: rGO) remains a highly disordered material. Here we report a simple, rapid method to reduce GO into pristine graphene using 1- to 2-second pulses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>es. The desirable structural properties are translated into mobility values of >1000 square centimeters per volt per second in field-effect transistors with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>e-reduced GO (MW-rGO) as the channel material and into particularly high activity for MW-rGO catalyst support toward oxygen evolution reactions.</p>

Recovery of otoacoustic emissions after high-level noise exposure in the American bullfrog
<p>The American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) has an amphibian papilla (AP) that senses airborne, low-frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> and generates distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) similar to other vertebrate species. Although ranid frogs are typically found in noisy environments, the effects of noise on the AP have not been studied. First, we determined the noise levels that diminished DPOAE at 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub> using an <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> stimulus level at 80 dB SPL and that also produced morphological damage of the sensory epithelium. Second, we compared DPOAE (2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub>) responses with histopathologic changes occurring in bullfrogs after noise exposure. Consistent morphological damage, such as fragmented hair cells and missing bundles, as well as elimination of DPOAE responses were seen only after very high-level (>150 dB SPL) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> exposures. The morphological response of hair cells to noise differed along the mediolateral AP axis: medial hair cells were sensitive to noise and lateral hair cells were relatively insensitive to noise. Renewed or repaired hair cells were not observed until 9 days post-exposure. Following noise exposure, DPOAE responses disappeared within 24 h and then recovered to normal pre-exposure levels within 3–4 days. Our results suggest that DPOAEs in the bullfrog are sensitive to the initial period of hair cell damage. After noise-induced damage, the bullfrog AP has functional recovery mechanisms that do not depend on substantial hair cell regeneration or repair. Thus, the bullfrog auditory system might serve as an interesting model for investigation of ways to prevent noise damage.</p>

Electron-phonon instability in graphene revealed by global and local noise probes

Spatial mapping of the nonequilibrium current fluctuations using nanoscale magnetic field sensors reveals that the fluctuations grow exponentially along the direction of carrier flow.

These results offer the opportunity for tunable terahertz generation and active phononic devices based on two-dimensional materials.</p>

Our approach is experimentally demonstrated at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>e frequencies through solving a generic integral equation and using a set of waveguides as the input and output to the designed metastructures. By exploiting subwavelength-scale light-matter interactions in a metamaterial platform, our wave-based, material-based analog computer may provide a route to achieve chip-scale, fast, and integrable computing elements.</p>

Human sound systems are shaped by post-Neolithic changes in bite configuration
<p>Linguistic diversity, now and in the past, is widely regarded to be independent of biological changes that took place after the emergence of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. We show converging evidence from paleoanthropology, speech biomechanics, ethnography, and historical linguistics that labiodental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>s (such as “f” and “v”) were innovated after the Neolithic. Changes in diet attributable to food-processing technologies modified the human bite from an edge-to-edge configuration to one that preserves adolescent overbite and overjet into adulthood. This change favored the emergence and maintenance of labiodentals. Our findings suggest that language is shaped not only by the contingencies of its history, but also by culturally induced changes in human biology.</p>

A Josephson relation for fractionally charged anyons
<p>Anyons occur in two-dimensional electron systems as excitations with fractional charge in the topologically ordered states of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Their dynamics are of utmost importance for topological quantum phases and possible decoherence-free quantum information approaches, but observing these dynamics experimentally is challenging.

Classifying drivers of global forest loss
<p>Global maps of forest loss depict the scale and magnitude of forest disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent conversion (i.e., deforestation) from temporary loss from forestry or wildfire. Using satellite imagery, we developed a forest loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of forest disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27% of global forest loss can be attributed to deforestation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to forestry (26%), shifting agriculture (24%), and wildfire (23%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined. To end deforestation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of conversion from supply chains each year.</p>

Radar evidence of subglacial liquid water on Mars
<p>The presence of liquid water at the base of the martian polar caps has long been suspected but not observed. We surveyed the Planum Australe region using the MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) instrument, a low-frequency radar on the Mars Express spacecraft. Radar profiles collected between May 2012 and December 2015 contain evidence of liquid water trapped below the ice of the South Polar Layered Deposits. Anomalously bright subsurface reflections are evident within a well-defined, 20-kilometer-wide zone centered at 193°E, 81°S, which is surrounded by much less reflective areas. Quantitative analysis of the radar signals shows that this bright feature has high relative dielectric permittivity (>15), matching that of water-bearing materials. We interpret this feature as a stable body of liquid water on Mars.</p>

The rise, collapse, and compaction of Mt. Mantap from the 3 September 2017 North Korean nuclear test
<p>Surveillance of clandestine nuclear tests relies on a global seismic network, but the potential of spaceborne monitoring has been underexploited. We used satellite radar imagery to determine the complete surface displacement field of up to 3.5 meters of divergent horizontal motion with 0.5 meters of subsidence associated with North Korea’s largest underground nuclear test. Combining insight from geodetic and seismological remote sensing, we found that the aftermath of the initial explosive deformation involved subsidence associated with subsurface collapse and aseismic compaction of the damaged rocks of the test site. The explosive yield from the nuclear detonation with best-fitting source parameters for 450-meter depth was 191 kilotonnes of TNT equivalent. Our results demonstrate the capability of spaceborne remote sensing to help characterize large underground nuclear tests.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin laser oscillators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked lasers, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>e oscillators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin lasers. The recent advent of hybrid photonic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that this silicon-based Brillouin laser enters a regime of dynamics in which optical self-oscillation produces phonon linewidth narrowing. Our results provide a platform to develop a range of applications for monolithic integration within silicon photonic circuits.</p>

However, the lack of an ideal Weyl system in which the Weyl points all exist at the same energy and are separated from any other bands poses a serious limitation to the further development of Weyl physics and potential applications. By experimentally characterizing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>e photonic crystal of saddle-shaped metallic coils, we observed ideal Weyl points that are related to each other through symmetry operations. Topological surface states exhibiting helicoidal structure have also been demonstrated. Our system provides a photonic platform for exploring ideal Weyl systems and developing possible topological devices.</p>

Topological and modality-specific representation of somatosensory information in the fly brain
<p>Insects and mammals share similarities of neural organization underlying the perception of odors, taste, vision, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>, and gravity. We observed that insect somatosensation also corresponds to that of mammals. In <i>Drosophila</i>, the projections of all the somatosensory neuron types to the insect’s equivalent of the spinal cord segregated into modality-specific layers comparable to those in mammals. Some sensory neurons innervate the ventral brain directly to form modality-specific and topological somatosensory maps. Ascending interneurons with dendrites in matching layers of the nerve cord send axons that converge to respective brain regions. Pathways arising from leg somatosensory neurons encode distinct qualities of leg movement information and play different roles in ground detection. Establishment of the ground pattern and genetic tools for neuronal manipulation should provide the basis for elucidating the mechanisms underlying somatosensation.</p>

Cash for carbon: A randomized trial of payments for ecosystem services to reduce deforestation
<p>We evaluated a program of payments for ecosystem services in Uganda that offered forest-owning households annual payments of 70,000 Ugandan shillings per hectare if they conserved their forest. The program was implemented as a randomized controlled trial in 121 villages, 60 of which received the program for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in land area covered by trees, measured by classifying high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that tree cover declined by 4.2% during the study period in treatment villages, compared to 9.1% in control villages. We found no evidence that enrollees shifted their deforestation to nearby land. We valued the delayed carbon dioxide emissions and found that this program benefit is 2.4 times as large as the program costs.</p>

Dual-comb spectroscopy of water vapor with a free-running semiconductor disk laser
<p>Dual-comb spectroscopy offers the potential for high accuracy combined with fast data acquisition. Applications are often limited, however, by the complexity of optical comb systems. Here we present dual-comb spectroscopy of water vapor using a substantially simplified single-laser system. Very good spectroscopy measurements with fast sampling rates are achieved with a free-running dual-comb mode-locked semiconductor disk laser. The absolute stability of the optical comb modes is characterized both for free-running operation and with simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>e stabilization. This approach drastically reduces the complexity for dual-comb spectroscopy. Band-gap engineering to tune the center wavelength from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared could optimize frequency combs for specific gas targets, further enabling dual-comb spectroscopy for a wider range of industrial applications.</p>

The extent of forest in dryland biomes
<p>Dryland biomes cover two-fifths of Earth’s land surface, but their forest area is poorly known. Here, we report an estimate of global forest extent in dryland biomes, based on analyzing more than 210,000 0.5-hectare sample plots through a photo-interpretation approach using large databases of satellite imagery at (i) very high spatial resolution and (ii) very high temporal resolution, which are available through the Google Earth platform. We show that in 2015, 1327 million hectares of drylands had more than 10% tree-cover, and 1079 million hectares comprised forest. Our estimate is 40 to 47% higher than previous estimates, corresponding to 467 million hectares of forest that have never been reported before. This increases current estimates of global forest cover by at least 9%.</p>

DeepStack: Expert-level artificial intelligence in heads-up no-limit poker
<p>Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that players have perfect information. Poker, the quintessential game of imperfect information, is a long-standing challenge problem in artificial intelligence. We introduce DeepStack, an algorithm for imperfect-information settings. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition that is automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack defeated, with statistical significance, professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em. The approach is theoretically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> and is shown to produce strategies that are more difficult to exploit than prior approaches.</p>

Photonic doping of epsilon-near-zero media
<p>Doping a semiconductor with foreign atoms enables the control of its electrical and optical properties. We transplant the concept of doping to macroscopic photonics, demonstrating that two-dimensional dielectric particles immersed in a two-dimensional epsilon-near-zero medium act as dopants that modify the medium’s effective permeability while keeping its effective permittivity near zero, independently of their positions within the host. The response of a large body can be tuned with a single impurity, including cases such as engineering perfect magnetic conductor and epsilon-and-mu-near-zero media with nonmagnetic constituents. This effect is experimentally demonstrated at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>e frequencies via the observation of geometry-independent tunneling. This methodology might provide a new pathway for engineering electromagnetic metamaterials and reconfigurable optical systems.</p>

Strong coupling of a single electron in silicon to a microwave photon
<p>Silicon is vital to the computing industry because of the high quality of its native oxide and well-established doping technologies. Isotopic purification has enabled quantum coherence times on the order of seconds, thereby placing silicon at the forefront of efforts to create a solid-state quantum processor. We demonstrate strong coupling of a single electron in a silicon double quantum dot to the photonic field of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microwav</span></strong>e cavity, as shown by the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting. Strong coupling of a quantum dot electron to a cavity photon would allow for long-range qubit coupling and the long-range entanglement of electrons in semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

Functional outcome of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention in periprosthetic joint infection involving the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Advocates of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR)   in hip periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) argue that a procedure   not disturbing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> prosthesis-bone interface is likely to lead   to better survival and functional outcome compared with revision.   This case-control study aims were to compare outcome of DAIRs for   infected primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) with outcomes following   primary THA and two-stage revision of infected primary THAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively reviewed all DAIRs, performed for confirmed   infected primary hip arthropasty (n = 82) at out institution, between   1997 and 2013. Data recorded included full patient information and   type of surgery. Outcome measures included complications, mortality,   implant survivorship and functional outcome. Outcome was compared with   two control groups matched for gender and age; a cohort of primary   THAs (n = 120) and a cohort of two-stage revisions for infection   (n = 66).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean age at DAIR was 69 years (33 to 87) and mean follow-up was   eight years (2 to 17; standard deviation (<sc>sd)</sc> 5). A total   of 52 (63%) of DAIRs were for early PJI (less than six weeks). Greater   success in the eradication of infection with DAIR was identified   with early PJI, comprising an interval less than a week between   onset of symptoms and exchange of modular components with the DAIR   procedure. Eradication of infection, complications and re-operation   rates were similar in the DAIR and two-stage revision groups. For   hips with successful eradication of infection with DAIR, the five-year   survival (98%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 94 to 100) was similar   to the primary THA group (98%; 95% CI 95 to 100) (n = 43; p = 0.3).   The DAIR group had inferior mean Oxford Hip Scores (OHS) (38; 12   to 48) compared with the primary THA group (42; 15 to 48) (p = 0.02)   but a significantly better mean OHS compared with the two-stage   revision group (31; 0 to 48) (p = 0.008).

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Phenotypic rescue of a <i>Drosophila</i> model of mitochondrial ANT1 disease
<p>A point mutation in the <i>Drosophila</i> gene that codes for the major adult isoform of adenine nuclear translocase (ANT) represents a model for human diseases that are associated with ANT insufficiency [<i>stress-sensitive B<sup>1</sup></i> (<i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i>)]. We characterized the organismal, bioenergetic and molecular phenotype of <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies then tested strategies to compensate the mutant phenotype. In addition to developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures, <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies have an impaired response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong>, defective male courtship, female sterility and curtailed lifespan. These phenotypes, excluding the latter two, are shared with the mitoribosomal protein S12 mutant, <i>tko<sup>25t</sup></i>. Mitochondria from <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults showed a decreased respiratory control ratio and downregulation of cytochrome oxidase. <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults exhibited ATP depletion, lactate accumulation and changes in gene expression that were consistent with a metabolic shift towards glycolysis, characterized by activation of lactate dehydrogenase and anaplerotic pathways. Females also showed downregulation of many genes that are required for oogenesis, and their eggs, although fertilized, failed to develop to the larval stages. The <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> phenotypes of developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures were alleviated by an altered mitochondrial DNA background. Female sterility was substantially rescued by somatic expression of alternative oxidase (AOX) from the sea squirt <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>, whereas AOX did not alleviate developmental delay. Our findings illustrate the potential of different therapeutic strategies for ANT-linked diseases, based on alleviating metabolic stress.</p>

Cardiovascular and Ventilatory Consequences of Laparoscopic Surgery
<p>Although laparoscopic surgery accounts for >2 million surgical procedures every year, the current preoperative risk scores and guidelines do not adequately assess the risks of laparoscopy. In general, laparoscopic procedures have a lower risk of morbidity and mortality compared with operations requiring a midline laparotomy. During laparoscopic surgery, carbon dioxide insufflation may produce significant hemodynamic and ventilatory consequences such as increased intraabdominal pressure and hypercarbia. Hemodynamic insults secondary to increased intraabdominal pressure include increased afterload and preload and decreased cardiac output, whereas ventilatory consequences include increased airway pressures, hypercarbia, and decreased pulmonary compliance. Hemodynamic effects are accentuated in patients with cardiovascular disease such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, and congenital heart disease. Prevention of cardiovascular complications may be accomplished through a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sound</span></strong> understanding of the hemodynamic and physiological consequences of laparoscopic surgery as well as a defined operative plan generated by a multidisciplinary team involving the preoperative consultant, anesthesiologist, and surgeon.</p>

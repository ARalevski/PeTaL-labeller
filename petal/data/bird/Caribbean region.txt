Reports of inner-ear damage deepen diplomat controversy
<p>The mystery illness first reported in late 2016 among U.S. diplomats in Havana is now affecting personnel at a U.S. consulate in Guangzhou, China. Yet 18 months in, an explanation is nowhere in sight, although hypotheses have proliferated. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson blamed a deliberate "health attack" for the Cuba ailments, whereas some neuroscientists and psychologists—and a panel of Cuban scientists—have written them off as the result of stress. Some unaffected diplomats from the Havana embassy agree. But a few researchers are finding hints of a physical cause for the symptoms, which include headaches, dizziness, and insomnia. In the latest proposal, Michael Hoffer, an otolaryngologist at the University of Miami in Florida, and his colleagues describe a unique vestibular and cognitive disorder in two dozen people evacuated from the Havana embassy.</p>

'Extinct' Caribbeans have living descendants
<p>Jorge Estevez grew up in the Dominican Republic and New York City hearing stories about his native Caribbean ancestors from his mother and grandmother. But when he told his teachers that he is Taino, an indigenous Caribbean, they said that was impossible. Many scientists and historians continue to believe the Taino were wiped out by disease, slavery, and other brutal consequences of European colonization without passing down any genes to people in the Caribbean today. But a new genetic study of a 1000-year-old skeleton from the Bahamas shows that at least one modern Caribbean population is related to the region's precontact indigenous people, offering direct molecular evidence against the idea of Taino "extinction."</p>

Use of cholera vaccines expands, raising hopes
<p>This could be a pivotal year in the fight against cholera, public health experts say. The disease has taken a large toll in the last months: In war-torn Yemen the number of cases reached more than a million; outbreaks ravaged South Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia, and other African countries; and Haiti continues to suffer from the disease. But an emergency vaccine stockpile established in 2013 has grown rapidly and a new, easier-to-use formulation has hit the market, making large-scale campaigns feasible. Soon, 2.4 million doses are to be shipped to Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where another epidemic looms. With interventions like this, experts hope to make a dent in the global burden of cholera, estimated at 3 million cases a year. And Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which is funding the stockpile, is set to decide later this year whether it will start funding routine immunizations in endemic areas as well.</p>

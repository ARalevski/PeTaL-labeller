Thrombospondin-1 promotes matrix homeostasis by interacting with collagen and lysyl oxidase precursors and collagen cross-linking sites
<p>Fibrillar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong>s of the extracellular matrix are critical for tissue structure and physiology; however, excessive or abnormal deposition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong>s is a defining feature of fibrosis. Regulatory mechanisms that act on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> fibril assembly potentially offer new targets for antifibrotic treatments. Tissue weakening, altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> fibril morphologies, or both, are shared phenotypes of mice lacking matricellular thrombospondins. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) plays an indirect role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s through interactions with matrix metalloproteinases and transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1). We found that TSP1 also affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> fibril formation directly. Compared to skin from wild-type mice, skin from <i>Thbs1</i><sup><i>−/−</i></sup> mice had reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> cross-linking and reduced prolysyl oxidase (proLOX) abundance with increased conversion to catalytically active LOX. In vitro, TSP1 bound to both the C-propeptide domain of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> I and the highly conserved KGHR sequences of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> triple-helical domain that participate in cross-linking. TSP1 also bound to proLOX and inhibited proLOX processing by bone morphogenetic protein-1. In human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), TSP1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> I colocalized in intracellular vesicles and on extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> fibrils, whereas TSP1 and proLOX colocalized only in intracellular vesicles. Inhibition of LOX-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> cross-linking did not prevent the extracellular association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> and TSP1; however, treatment of HDFs with KGHR-containing, TSP1-binding, triple-helical peptides disrupted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong>-TSP1 association, perturbed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> extracellular matrix, and increased myofibroblastic differentiation in a manner that depended on TGF-β receptor 1. Thus, the extracellular KGHR-dependent interaction of TSP1 with fibrillar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong>s contributes to fibroblast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s.</p>

A Framework for Lateral Membrane Trafficking and Polar Tethering of the PEN3 ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter
<p>The outermost cell layer of plants, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epidermi</span></strong>s, and its outer (lateral) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e domain facing the environment are continuously challenged by biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epidermi</span></strong>s and the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e domain provide important selective and protective barriers. However, only a small number of specifically outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e-localized proteins are known. Similarly, molecular mechanisms underlying the trafficking and the polar placement of outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e domain proteins require further exploration. Here, we demonstrate that ACTIN7 (ACT7) mediates trafficking of the PENETRATION3 (PEN3) outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e protein from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e in the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epidermi</span></strong>s of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and that actin function contributes to PEN3 endocytic recycling. In contrast to such generic ACT7-dependent trafficking from the TGN, the EXOCYST84b (EXO84b) tethering factor mediates PEN3 outer-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e polarity. Moreover, precise EXO84b placement at the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e domain itself requires ACT7 function. Hence, our results uncover spatially and mechanistically distinct requirements for ACT7 function during outer lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e cargo trafficking and polarity establishment. They further identify an exocyst tethering complex mediator of outer lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e cargo polarity.</p>

RSL Class II Transcription Factors Guide the Nuclear Localization of RHL1 to Regulate Root Hair Development
<p>Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s are important for absorption of nutrients and water from the rhizosphere. The Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> Defective-Six Like (RSL) Class II family of transcription factors is expressed preferentially in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s and has a conserved role in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development in land plants. We functionally characterized the seven members of the RSL Class II subfamily in the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genome. In root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s, six of these genes were preferentially expressed and four were strongly expressed. Phenotypic analysis of each mutant revealed that <i>Os07g39940</i> plays a major role in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> formation, based on observations of a short root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> phenotype in those mutants. Overexpression (OX) for each of four family members in rice resulted in an increase in the density and length of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s. These four members contain a transcription activation domain and are targeted to the nucleus. They interact with rice Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>less1 (OsRHL1), a key regulator of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development. When heterologously expressed in epidermal cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves, OsRHL1 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. When coexpressed with each of the four RSL Class II members, however, OsRLH1 was translocated to the nucleus. Transcriptome analysis using <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants revealed that 86 genes, including Class III peroxidases, were highly up-regulated. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species levels in the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s were increased in <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants but were drastically reduced in the <i>os07g39940</i> and <i>rhl1</i> mutants. Our results demonstrate that RSL Class II members function as essential regulators of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development in rice.</p>

Mammalian pigmentation is regulated by a distinct cAMP-dependent mechanism that controls melanosome pH
<p>The production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melanin</span></strong> increases skin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation and reduces the risk of skin cancer. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melanin</span></strong> production depends on the pH of melanosomes, which are more acidic in lighter-skinned than in darker-skinned people. We showed that inhibition of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation by increasing the pH of melanosomes both in cells and in vivo. Distinct from the canonical melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R)–dependent cAMP pathway that controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation by altering gene expression, we found that inhibition of sAC increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ation by increasing the activity of tyrosinase, the rate-limiting enzyme in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melanin</span></strong> synthesis, which is more active at basic pH. We demonstrated that the effect of sAC activity on pH and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">melanin</span></strong> production in human melanocytes depended on the skin color of the donor.

Unusual Roles of Secretory SNARE SYP132 in Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Traffic and Vegetative Plant Growth
<p>The plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proton (H<sup>+</sup>)-ATPases of plants generate steep electrochemical gradients and activate osmotic solute uptake. H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-mediated proton pumping orchestrates cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s and is a prerequisite for plastic cell expansion and plant growth. All evidence suggests that the population of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e reflects a balance of their roles in exocytosis, endocytosis, and recycling. Auxin governs both traffic and activation of the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins already present at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e. As in other eukaryotes, in plants, SNARE-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e traffic influences the density of several proteins at the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e. Even so, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic, its relationship with SNAREs, and its regulation by auxin have remained enigmatic. Here, we identify the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Qa-SNARE SYP132 (Syntaxin of Plants132) as a key factor in H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and demonstrate its association with endocytosis. SYP132 is a low-abundant, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ory SNARE that primarily localizes to the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e. We find that <i>SYP132</i> expression is tightly regulated by auxin and that augmented SYP132 expression reduces the amount of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e. The physiological consequences of SYP132 overexpression include reduced apoplast acidification and suppressed vegetative growth. Thus, SYP132 plays unexpected and vital roles in auxin-regulated H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and associated functions at the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein MAP18 Affects ROP2 GTPase Activity during Root Hair Growth
<p>Establishment and maintenance of the polar site are important for root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> tip growth. We previously reported that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN18 (MAP18) functions in controlling the direction of pollen tube growth and root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> elongation. Additionally, the Rop GTPase ROP2 was reported as a positive regulator of both root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> initiation and tip growth in Arabidopsis. Both loss of function of <i>ROP2</i> and knockdown of <i>MAP18</i> lead to a decrease in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> length, whereas overexpression of either <i>MAP18</i> or <i>ROP2</i> causes multiple tips or a branching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> phenotype. However, it is unclear whether MAP18 and ROP2 coordinately regulate root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth. In this study, we demonstrate that MAP18 and ROP2 interact genetically and functionally. MAP18 interacts physically with ROP2 in vitro and in vivo and preferentially binds to the inactive form of the ROP2 protein. MAP18 promotes ROP2 activity during root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> tip growth. Further investigation revealed that MAP18 competes with RhoGTPase GDP DISSOCIATION INHIBITOR1/SUPERCENTIPEDE1 for binding to ROP2, in turn affecting the localization of active ROP2 in the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e of the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> tip. These results reveal a novel function of MAP18 in the regulation of ROP2 activation during root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth.</p>

T-plastin is essential for basement membrane assembly and epidermal morphogenesis
<p>The establishment of epithelial architecture is a complex process involving cross-talk between cells and the basement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e. Basement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e assembly requires integrin activity but the role of the associated actomyosin cytoskeleton is poorly understood. Here, we identify the actin-bundling protein T-plastin (Pls3) as a regulator of basement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e assembly and epidermal morphogenesis. In utero depletion of <i>Pls3</i> transcripts in mouse embryos caused basement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e and polarity defects in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epidermi</span></strong>s but had little effect on cell adhesion and differentiation. Loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that the apicobasal polarity defects were secondary to the disruption of the basement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e. However, the basement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e itself was profoundly sensitive to subtle perturbations in the actin cytoskeleton. We further show that Pls3 localized to the cell cortex, where it was essential for the localization and activation of myosin II. Inhibition of myosin II motor activity disrupted basement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e organization. Our results provide insights into the regulation of cortical actomyosin and its importance for basement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e assembly and skin morphogenesis.</p>

Photochemistry beyond the red limit in chlorophyll f–containing photosystems

Cold acclimation alters the connective tissue content of the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) heart
<p>Thermal acclimation can alter cardiac function and morphology in a number of fish species, but little is known about the regulation of these changes. The purpose of the present study was to determine how cold acclimation affects zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) cardiac morphology, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> composition and connective tissue regulation. Heart volume, the thickness of the compact myocardium, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> content and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> fiber composition were compared between control (27°C) and cold-acclimated (20°C) zebrafish using serially sectioned hearts stained with Picrosirius Red. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> content and fiber composition of the pericardial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e were also examined. Cold acclimation did not affect the volume of the contracted heart; however, there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the compact myocardium. There was also a decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> content of the compact myocardium and in the amount of thick <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> fibers throughout the heart. Cold-acclimated zebrafish also increased expression of the gene transcript for matrix metalloproteinase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> Type I α1. We propose that the reduction in the thickness of the compact myocardium as well as the change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">collagen</span></strong> content may help to maintain the compliance of the ventricle as temperatures decrease. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the zebrafish heart undergoes significant remodeling in response to cold acclimation.</p>

Abl and Arg mediate cysteine cathepsin secretion to facilitate melanoma invasion and metastasis
<p>The incidence of melanoma is increasing, particularly in young women, and the disease remains incurable for many because of its aggressive, metastatic nature and its high rate of resistance to conventional, targeted, and immunological agents. Cathepsins are proteases that are critical for melanoma progression and therapeutic resistance. Intracellular cathepsins cleave or degrade proteins that restrict cancer progression, whereas extracellular cathepsins directly cleave the extracellular matrix and activate proinvasive proteases in the tumor microenvironment. Cathepsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion is markedly increased in cancer cells. We investigated the signaling pathways leading to increased cathepsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion in melanoma cells. We found that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases Abl and Arg (Abl/Arg) promoted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of cathepsin B and cathepsin L by activating transcription factors (namely, Ets1, Sp1, and NF-κB/p65) that have key roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, and therapeutic resistance. In some melanoma cell lines, Abl/Arg promoted the Ets1/p65-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion of cathepsin B and cathepsin L in a kinase-independent manner, whereas in other melanoma lines, Abl/Arg promoted the kinase-dependent, Sp1/Ets1/p65–mediated induction of cathepsin L <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion and the Sp1/p65-mediated induction of cathepsin B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. As an indication of clinical relevance, the abundance of mRNAs encoding Abl/Arg, Sp1, Ets1, and cathepsins was positively correlated in primary melanomas, and Abl/Arg-driven invasion in culture and metastasis in vivo required cathepsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. These data suggest that drugs targeting Abl kinases, many of which are FDA-approved, might inhibit cathepsin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion in some melanomas and potentially other aggressive cancers harboring activated Abl kinases.</p>

Lipopolysaccharide is transported to the cell surface by a membrane-to-membrane protein bridge
<p>Gram-negative bacteria have an outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e that serves as a barrier to noxious agents in the environment. This protective function is dependent on lipopolysaccharide, a large glycolipid located in the outer leaflet of the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e. Lipopolysaccharide is synthesized at the cytoplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e and must be transported to the cell surface.

Identification of Putative Substrates of SEC2, a Chloroplast Inner Envelope Translocase
<p>Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into chloroplasts. Many imported proteins are further targeted to the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e and lumen by the SEC1, TAT, or SRP/ALB3 translocases. Others are targeted to the inner chloroplast envelope <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e by undescribed translocases. Recently, a second SEC system (SEC2) consisting of SCY2, SECE2, and SECA2 was found in the chloroplast envelope. Null mutants of <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exhibit a severe embryo-lethal phenotype. To investigate the function of the SEC2 system in plants, we used inducible RNA interference to knock down <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis. Seedlings cultured with inducer were chlorotic with aberrant chloroplasts and undeveloped thylakoids, indicating an essential role for SCY2 in chloroplast biogenesis beyond embryo development. In <i>SCY2</i> down-regulated seedlings, several thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proteins, including SCY1, ALB3, and TATC, and inner envelope <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proteins, including TIC40, TIC110, and FTSH12, were reduced substantially, suggesting that they may be SEC2 substrates. Additional insight was achieved by the in vitro reconstitution of protein integration into chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es. The results show that SCY1 and ALB3 target directly to the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e and are likely independent of SEC2. FTSH12 was integrated into the envelope <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e in a coupled import-integration reaction that was impaired by the SECA inhibitor sodium azide. The stromal intermediate of TIC40 integrated into the envelope in a reaction that was largely inhibited when antibodies against epitope-tagged SCY2 or SECE2 were applied. These data demonstrate that the SEC2 translocase likely integrates a subset of inner envelope <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proteins, such as FTSH12 and TIC40.</p>

The Non-Mendelian Green Cotyledon Gene in Soybean Encodes a Small Subunit of Photosystem II
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation plays important roles in leaf senescence including regulation of degradation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins. Although most genes encoding enzymes of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation pathway have been identified, the regulation of their activity has not been fully understood. Green cotyledon mutants in legume are stay-green mutants, in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation is impaired during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Among them, the soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) green cotyledon gene <i>cytG</i> is unique because it is maternally inherited. To isolate <i>cytG</i>, we extensively sequenced the soybean chloroplast genome, and detected a 5-bp insertion causing a frame-shift in <i>psbM</i>, which encodes one of the small subunits of photosystem II. Mutant tobacco plants (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) with a disrupted <i>psbM</i> generated using a chloroplast transformation technique had green senescent leaves, confirming that <i>cytG</i> encodes PsbM. The phenotype of <i>cytG</i> was very similar to that of mutant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i> reductase catalyzing the first step of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i> degradation. In fact, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>b</i>-degrading activity in dark-grown <i>cytG</i> and <i>psbM</i>-knockout seedlings was significantly lower than that of wild-type plants. Our results suggest that PsbM is a unique protein linking photosynthesis in presenescent leaves with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l degradation during leaf senescence and seed maturation. Additionally, we discuss the origin of <i>cytG</i>, which may have been selected during domestication of soybean.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation occurs from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epidermi</span></strong>s at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Hydrocarbons Are Essential for Optimal Cell Size, Division, and Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>Cyanobacteria are intricately organized, incorporating an array of internal thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es, the site of photosynthesis, into cells no larger than other bacteria. They also synthesize C15-C19 alkanes and alkenes, which results in substantial production of hydrocarbons in the environment. All sequenced cyanobacteria encode hydrocarbon biosynthesis pathways, suggesting an important, undefined physiological role for these compounds. Here, we demonstrate that hydrocarbon-deficient mutants of <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 and <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 exhibit significant phenotypic differences from wild type, including enlarged cell size, reduced growth, and increased division defects. Photosynthetic rates were similar between strains, although a minor reduction in energy transfer between the soluble light harvesting phycobilisome complex and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e-bound photosystems was observed. Hydrocarbons were shown to accumulate in thylakoid and cytoplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es. Modeling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es suggests these compounds aggregate in the center of the lipid bilayer, potentially promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e flexibility and facilitating curvature. In vivo measurements confirmed that <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 mutants lacking hydrocarbons exhibit reduced thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e curvature compared to wild type. We propose that hydrocarbons may have a role in inducing the flexibility in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es required for optimal cell division, size, and growth, and efficient association of soluble and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e bound proteins. The recent identification of C15-C17 alkanes and alkenes in microalgal species suggests hydrocarbons may serve a similar function in a broad range of photosynthetic organisms.</p>

Recovery of otoacoustic emissions after high-level noise exposure in the American bullfrog
<p>The American bullfrog (<i>Rana catesbeiana</i>) has an amphibian papilla (AP) that senses airborne, low-frequency sound and generates distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) similar to other vertebrate species. Although ranid frogs are typically found in noisy environments, the effects of noise on the AP have not been studied. First, we determined the noise levels that diminished DPOAE at 2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub> using an <i>f</i><sub>2</sub> stimulus level at 80 dB SPL and that also produced morphological damage of the sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">epithelium</span></strong>. Second, we compared DPOAE (2<i>f</i><sub>1</sub>–<i>f</i><sub>2</sub>) responses with histopathologic changes occurring in bullfrogs after noise exposure. Consistent morphological damage, such as fragmented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells and missing bundles, as well as elimination of DPOAE responses were seen only after very high-level (>150 dB SPL) sound exposures. The morphological response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells to noise differed along the mediolateral AP axis: medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells were sensitive to noise and lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells were relatively insensitive to noise. Renewed or repaired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells were not observed until 9 days post-exposure. Following noise exposure, DPOAE responses disappeared within 24 h and then recovered to normal pre-exposure levels within 3–4 days. Our results suggest that DPOAEs in the bullfrog are sensitive to the initial period of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cell damage. After noise-induced damage, the bullfrog AP has functional recovery mechanisms that do not depend on substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cell regeneration or repair. Thus, the bullfrog auditory system might serve as an interesting model for investigation of ways to prevent noise damage.</p>

Membrane depolarization activates BK channels through ROCK-mediated β1 subunit surface trafficking to limit vasoconstriction
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e depolarization of smooth muscle cells (myocytes) in the small arteries that regulate regional organ blood flow leads to vasoconstriction. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e depolarization also activates large-conductance calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)–activated potassium (BK) channels, which limits Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity that promotes vasoconstriction, thus leading to vasodilation. We showed that in human and rat arterial myocytes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e depolarization rapidly increased the cell surface abundance of auxiliary BK β1 subunits but not that of the pore-forming BKα channels. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e depolarization stimulated voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the activation of Rho kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2. ROCK1/2-mediated activation of Rab11A promoted the delivery of β1 subunits to the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e by Rab11A-positive recycling endosomes. These additional β1 subunits associated with BKα channels already at the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e, leading to an increase in apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and activation of the channels in pressurized arterial myocytes and vasodilation. Thus, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e depolarization activates BK channels through stimulation of ROCK- and Rab11A-dependent trafficking of β1 subunits to the surface of arterial myocytes.</p>

Infrared Nanospectroscopy Reveals the Chemical Nature of Pit Membranes in Water-Conducting Cells of the Plant Xylem
<p>In the xylem of angiosperm plants, microscopic pits through the secondary cell walls connect the water-conducting vessels. Cellulosic meshes originated from primary walls, and middle lamella between adjacent vessels, called the pit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e, separates one conduit from another. The intricate structure of the nano-sized pores in pit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es enables the passage of water under negative pressure without hydraulic failure due to obstruction by gas bubbles (i.e. embolism) under normal conditions or mild drought stress. Since the chemical composition of pit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es affects embolism formation and bubble behavior, we directly measured pit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e composition in <i>Populus nigra</i> wood. Here, we characterized the chemical composition of cell wall structures by synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy and atomic force microscopy-infrared nanospectroscopy with high spatial resolution. Characteristic peaks of cellulose, phenolic compounds, and proteins were found in the intervessel pit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es of <i>P. nigra</i> wood. In addition, the vessel to parenchyma pit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es and developing cell walls of the vascular cambium showed clear signals of cellulose, proteins, and pectin. We did not find a distinct peak of lignin and other compounds in these structures. Our investigation of the complex chemical composition of intervessel pit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es furthers our understanding of the flow of water and bubbles between neighboring conduits. The advances presented here pave the way for further label-free studies related to the nanochemistry of plant cell components.</p>

VIPP1 Involved in Chloroplast Membrane Integrity Has GTPase Activity in Vitro
<p>VESICLE-INDUCING PROTEIN IN PLASTID1 (VIPP1) is conserved among oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and appears to have diverged from the bacterial PspA protein. VIPP1 localizes to the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e, where it forms homooligomers of high molecular mass. Although multiple roles of VIPP1 have been inferred, including thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e formation, envelope maintenance, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e fusion, and regulation of photosynthetic activity, its precise role in chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e quality control remains unknown. VIPP1 forms an oligomer through its amino-terminal domain and triggers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e fusion in an Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. We previously demonstrated that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) VIPP1 also exhibits dynamic complex disassembly in response to osmotic and heat stresses in vivo. These results suggest that VIPP1 mediates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e fusion/remodeling in chloroplasts. Considering that protein machines that regulate intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e fusion/remodeling events often require a capacity for GTP binding and/or hydrolysis, we questioned whether VIPP1 has similar properties. We conducted an in vitro assay using a purified VIPP1-His fusion protein expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells. VIPP1-His showed GTP hydrolysis activity that was inhibited competitively by an unhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTPγS, and that depends on GTP binding. It is particularly interesting that the ancestral PspA from <i>E. coli</i> also possesses GTP hydrolysis activity. Although VIPP1 does not contain a canonical G domain, the amino-terminal α-helix was found to be important for both GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis as well as for oligomer formation. Collectively, our results reveal that the properties of VIPP1/PspA are similar to those of GTPases.</p>

The Ribosome-Bound Protein Pam68 Promotes Insertion of Chlorophyll into the CP47 Subunit of Photosystem II
<p>Photosystem II (PSII) is a large enzyme complex embedded in the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e of oxygenic phototrophs. The biogenesis of PSII requires the assembly of more than 30 subunits, with the assistance of a number of auxiliary proteins. In plants and cyanobacteria, the photosynthesis-affected mutant 68 (Pam68) is important for PSII assembly. However, its mechanisms of action remain unknown. Using a <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC 6803 strain expressing Flag-tagged Pam68, we purified a large protein complex containing ribosomes, SecY translocase, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding PSII inner antenna CP47. Using 2D gel electrophoresis, we identified a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>ed Pam68-CP47 subcomplex and found Pam68 bound to ribosomes. Our results show that Pam68 binds to ribosomes even in the absence of CP47 translation. Furthermore, Pam68 associates with CP47 at an early phase of its biogenesis and promotes the synthesis of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding polypeptide until the attachment of the small PSII subunit PsbH. Deletion of both Pam68 and PsbH nearly abolishes the synthesis of CP47, which can be restored by enhancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. These results strongly suggest that ribosome-bound Pam68 stabilizes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e segments of CP47 and facilitates the insertion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l molecules into the translated CP47 polypeptide chain.</p>

The Deubiquitinase OTU5 Regulates Root Responses to Phosphate Starvation
<p>Phosphorus, taken up by plants as inorganic phosphate (Pi), is an essential but often growth-limiting mineral nutrient for plants. As part of an orchestrated response to improve its acquisition, insufficient Pi supply triggers alterations in root architecture and epidermal cell morphogenesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants defective in the expression of the <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) exhibited a constitutive Pi deficiency root phenotype, comprising the formation of long and dense root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s and attenuated primary root growth. Quantitative protein profiling of <i>otu5</i> and wild-type roots using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification methodology revealed genotype- and Pi-dependent alterations in protein profiles. In <i>otu5</i> plants, Pi starvation caused a short-root-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> phenotype and decreased abundance of a suite of Pi-responsive root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>-related proteins. Mutant plants also showed the accumulation of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and altered distribution of reactive oxygen species along the root, which may be causative for the alterations in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> morphogenesis. The root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> phenotype of <i>otu5</i> was synergistic to that of <i>actin-related protein6</i> (<i>arp6</i>), harboring a mutation in the SWR1 chromatin-remodeling complex. Genetic analysis of <i>otu5/arp6</i> double mutants suggests independent but functionally related roles of the two proteins in chromatin organization. The root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> phenotype of <i>otu5</i> is not caused by a general up-regulation of the Pi starvation response, indicating that OTU5 acts downstream of or interacts with Pi signaling. It is concluded that OTU5 is involved in the interpretation of environmental information, probably by altering chromatin organization and maintaining redox <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s.</p>

Involvement of Adapter Protein Complex 4 in Hypersensitive Cell Death Induced by Avirulent Bacteria<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant immunity to avirulent bacterial pathogens is associated with subcellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e dynamics including fusion between the vacuolar and plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es, resulting in hypersensitive cell death. Here, we report that ADAPTOR PROTEIN COMPLEX-4 (AP-4) subunits are involved in plant immunity associated with hypersensitive cell death. We isolated a mutant with a defect in resistance to an avirulent strain of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pto</i>) DC3000 <i>avrRpm1</i> from a vacuolar protein sorting mutant library of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The mutant was identical to <i>gfs4-1</i>, which has a mutation in the gene encoding the AP-4 subunit AP4B. Thus, we focused on AP4B and another subunit, AP4E. All of the mutants (<i>ap4b-3</i>, <i>ap4b-4</i>, <i>ap4e-1</i>, and <i>ap4e-2</i>) were defective in hypersensitive cell death and resistance to <i>Pto</i> DC3000 with the type III effector AvrRpm1 or AvrRpt2, both of which are recognized on the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e, while they showed slightly enhanced susceptibility to the type-III-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion-deficient <i>P. syringae</i> strain <i>hrcC</i>. On the other hand, both <i>ap4b-3</i> and <i>ap4b-4</i> showed no defect in resistance to <i>Pto</i> DC3000 with the type III effector AvrRps4, which is recognized in the cytosol and does not induce hypersensitive cell death. Upon infection with <i>Pto</i> DC3000 <i>avrRpt2</i>, the <i>ap4b-3</i> and <i>ap4b-4</i> leaf cells did not show fusion between vacuolar and plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es, whereas the wild-type leaf cells did. These results suggest that AP-4 contributes to cell death-associated immunity, possibly via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e fusion, after type III effector-recognition on the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e.</p>

Efficient ER Fusion Requires a Dimerization and a C-Terminal Tail Mediated Membrane Anchoring of RHD3
<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of tubules and sheets stretching throughout the eukaryotic cells. The formation of the ER requires homotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e fusion, which is mediated by a family of Dynamin-like Atlastin GTPase proteins. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) member ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE3 (RHD3) has been demonstrated to mediate ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e fusion, but how exactly RHD3 is involved in the process is still unknown. Here we conducted systemic structure-function analyses of roles of different RHD3 domains in mediating ER fusion. We showed that efficient ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e fusion mediated by RHD3 requires a proper dimerization of RHD3 through the GTPase domain (GD) and the first and second three helix bundles (3HBs) in the middle domain. RHD3 has a 3HB-enriched middle domain longer than that of Atlastins, and we revealed that the third and fourth 3HBs are required for the stability of RHD3. The trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e segments of RHD3 are essential for targeting and retention of RHD3 in the ER and can also facilitate an oligomerization of RHD3. Furthermore, we showed that an amphipathic helix in the C-terminal cytosolic tail of RHD3 has a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e anchoring ability that is required for efficient ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e fusion mediated by RHD3. This work contributes to a better understanding of a coordinated action of RHD3 in the fusion of ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion during tip growth.</p>

Auxin and ROP GTPase Signaling of Polar Nuclear Migration in Root Epidermal Hair Cells
<p>Polar nuclear migration is crucial during the development of diverse eukaryotes. In plants, root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth requires polar nuclear migration into the outgrowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>. However, knowledge about the dynamics and the regulatory mechanisms underlying nuclear movements in root epidermal cells remains limited. Here, we show that both auxin and Rho-of-Plant (ROP) signaling modulate polar nuclear position at the inner epidermal plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e domain oriented to the cortical cells during cell elongation as well as subsequent polar nuclear movement to the outer domain into the emerging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> bulge in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Auxin signaling via the nuclear AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE ACETIC ACID7 pathway ensures correct nuclear placement toward the inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e domain. Moreover, precise inner nuclear placement relies on SPIKE1 Rho-GEF, SUPERCENTIPEDE1 Rho-GDI, and ACTIN7 (ACT7) function and to a lesser extent on VTI11 vacuolar SNARE activity. Strikingly, the directionality and/or velocity of outer polar nuclear migration into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> outgrowth along actin strands also are ACT7 dependent, auxin sensitive, and regulated by ROP signaling. Thus, our findings provide a founding framework revealing auxin and ROP signaling of inner polar nuclear position with some contribution by vacuolar morphology and of actin-dependent outer polar nuclear migration in root epidermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> cells.</p>

Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Facilitates Synthesis of Photoactive Protochlorophyllide in Etioplasts
<p>Cotyledon cells of dark-germinated angiosperms develop etioplasts that are plastids containing unique internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es called prolamellar bodies (PLBs). Proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide (Pchlide), a precursor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l, accumulates in PLBs and forms a ternary complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide oxidoreductase (LPOR), which allows for the rapid formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l after illumination while avoiding photodamage. PLBs are 3D lattice structures formed by the lipid bilayer rich in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Although MGDG was found to be required for the formation and function of the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e in chloroplasts in various plants, the roles of MGDG in PLB formation and etioplast development are largely unknown. To analyze the roles of MGDG in etioplast development, we suppressed <i>MGD1</i> encoding the major isoform of MGDG synthase by using a dexamethasone-inducible artificial microRNA in etiolated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Strong <i>MGD1</i> suppression caused a 36% loss of MGDG in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total Pchlide content. The loss of MGDG perturbed etioplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e structures and impaired the formation of the photoactive Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and its oligomerization, without affecting LPOR accumulation. The <i>MGD1</i> suppression also impaired the formation of Pchlide from protoporphyrin IX via multiple enzymatic reactions in etioplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es, which suggests that MGDG is required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e-associated processes in the Pchlide biosynthesis pathway. Suppressing <i>MGD1</i> at several germination stages revealed that MGDG biosynthesis at an early germination stage is particularly important for Pchlide accumulation. MGDG biosynthesis may provide a lipid matrix for Pchlide biosynthesis and the formation of Pchlide-LPOR complexes as an initial step of etioplast development.</p>

Other thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e complexes accumulated to normal levels. The T-DNA knockout mutant <i>hcf222-2</i> showed a more severe defect with respect to thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proteins and accumulated only 10% of the Cytb6f complex, accompanied by a reduction in photosystem II, the photosystem II light-harvesting complex, and photosystem I. <i>HCF222</i> encodes a protein of 99 amino acids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that has similarities to the cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain of DnaJ chaperones. The insulin precipitation assay demonstrated that HCF222 has disulfide reductase activity in vitro. The protein is conserved in higher plants and bryophytes but absent in algae and cyanobacteria. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that a fraction of HCF222-green fluorescent protein was detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum but that it also could be recognized in chloroplasts. A fusion construct of HCF222 containing a plastid transit peptide targets the protein into chloroplasts and was able to complement the mutational defect. These findings indicate that the chloroplast-targeted HCF222 is indispensable for the maturation and/or assembly of the Cytb6f complex and is very likely involved in thiol-disulfide biochemistry at the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e.</p>

Diversification of Root Hair Development Genes in Vascular Plants
<p>The molecular genetic program for root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development has been studied intensively in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).

Combining phylogenetics and transcriptomics, we discovered conservation of a core set of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> genes across all vascular plants, which may derive from an ancient program for unidirectional cell growth coopted for root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development during vascular plant evolution. Interestingly, we also discovered preferential diversification in the structure and expression of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development genes, relative to other root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>- and root-expressed genes, among these species. These differences enabled the definition of sets of genes and gene functions that were acquired or lost in specific lineages during vascular plant evolution. In particular, we found substantial divergence in the structure and expression of genes used for root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> patterning, suggesting that the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not shared by other species. To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive view of gene expression in a single plant cell type across multiple species.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 protein of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) protein family, which also includes the light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible proteins, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix proteins and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible proteins. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l binding, protein interaction, and integration of interacting partners into the plastid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple protein-protein interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their protein products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Optimization of Light-Harvesting Pigment Improves Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>Maximizing light capture by light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong> optimization represents an attractive but challenging strategy to improve photosynthetic efficiency. Here, we report that loss of a previously uncharacterized gene, <i>HIGH PHOTOSYNTHETIC EFFICIENCY1</i> (<i>HPE1</i>), optimizes light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>hpe1</i> mutants show faster electron transport and increased contents of carbohydrates. <i>HPE1</i> encodes a chloroplast protein containing an RNA recognition motif that directly associates with and regulates the splicing of target RNAs of plastid genes. HPE1 also interacts with other plastid RNA-splicing factors, including CAF1 and OTP51, which share common targets with HPE1. Deficiency of HPE1 alters the expression of nucleus-encoded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-related genes, probably through plastid-to-nucleus signaling, causing decreased total content of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>) in a limited range but increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> ratio. Interestingly, this adjustment of light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong> reduces antenna size, improves light capture, decreases energy loss, mitigates photodamage, and enhances photosynthetic quantum yield during photosynthesis. Our findings suggest a novel strategy to optimize light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pigment</span></strong>s that improves photosynthetic efficiency and biomass production in higher plants.</p>

Packing of apolar side chains enables accurate design of highly stable membrane proteins
<p>The features that stabilize the structures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proteins remain poorly understood. Polar interactions contribute modestly, and the hydrophobic effect contributes little to the energetics of apolar side-chain packing in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es. Disruption of steric packing can destabilize the native folds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proteins, but is packing alone sufficient to drive folding in lipids? If so, then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proteins stabilized by this feature should be readily designed and structurally characterized—yet this has not been achieved. Through simulation of the natural protein phospholamban and redesign of variants, we define a steric packing code underlying its assembly. Synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proteins designed using this code and stabilized entirely by apolar side chains conform to the intended fold. Although highly stable, the steric complementarity required for their folding is surprisingly stringent. Structural informatics shows that the designed packing motif recurs across the proteome, emphasizing a prominent role for precise apolar packing in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e protein folding, stabilization, and evolution.</p>

BAK/BAX macropores facilitate mitochondrial herniation and mtDNA efflux during apoptosis
<p>Mitochondrial apoptosis is mediated by BAK and BAX, two proteins that induce mitochondrial outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e permeabilization, leading to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytochrom</span></strong>e c release and activation of apoptotic caspases. In the absence of active caspases, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) triggers the innate immune cGAS/STING pathway, causing dying cells to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>e type I interferon. How cGAS gains access to mtDNA remains unclear. We used live-cell lattice light-sheet microscopy to examine the mitochondrial network in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We found that after BAK/BAX activation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytochrom</span></strong>e c loss, the mitochondrial network broke down and large BAK/BAX pores appeared in the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e. These BAK/BAX macropores allowed the inner mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e to herniate into the cytosol, carrying with it mitochondrial matrix components, including the mitochondrial genome. Apoptotic caspases did not prevent herniation but dismantled the dying cell to suppress mtDNA-induced innate immune signaling.</p>

The ER membrane protein complex is a transmembrane domain insertase
<p>Insertion of proteins into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es is an essential cellular process. The extensive biophysical and topological diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proteins necessitates multiple insertion pathways that remain incompletely defined. Here we found that known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e insertion pathways fail to effectively engage tail-anchored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proteins with moderately hydrophobic trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e domains. These proteins are instead shielded in the cytosol by calmodulin. Dynamic release from calmodulin allowed sampling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the conserved ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e protein complex (EMC) was shown to be essential for efficient insertion in vitro and in cells. Purified EMC in synthetic liposomes catalyzed the insertion of its substrates in a reconstituted system. Thus, EMC is a trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e domain insertase, a function that may explain its widely pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e-associated phenotypes across organisms.</p>

ONE-HELIX PROTEIN2 (OHP2) Is Required for the Stability of OHP1 and Assembly Factor HCF244 and Is Functionally Linked to PSII Biogenesis
<p>The members of the light-harvesting complex protein family, which include the one-helix proteins (OHPs), are characterized by one to four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e-spanning helices. These proteins function in light absorption and energy dissipation, sensing light intensity, and triggering photomorphogenesis or the binding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and intermediates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains two OHPs, while four homologs (named high-light-induced proteins) exist in <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC6803. Various functions have been assigned to high-light-induced proteins, ranging from photoprotection and the assembly of photosystem I (PSI) and PSII to regulation of the early steps of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis, but little is known about the function of the two plant OHPs. Here, we show that the two Arabidopsis OHPs form heterodimers and that the stromal part of OHP2 interacts with the plastid-localized PSII assembly factor HIGH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>L FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244). Moreover, concurrent accumulation of the two OHPs and HCF244 is critical for the stability of all three proteins. In particular, the absence of OHP2 leads to the complete loss of OHP1 and HCF244. We used a virus-induced gene silencing approach to minimize the expression of <i>OHP1</i> or <i>OHP2</i> in adult Arabidopsis plants and revealed that OHP2 is essential for the accumulation of the PSII core subunits, while the other photosynthetic complexes and the major light-harvesting complex proteins remained unaffected. We examined the potential functions of the OHP1-OHP2-HCF244 complex in the assembly and/or repair of PSII and propose a role for this heterotrimeric complex in thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e biogenesis.</p>

Three-Dimensional Analysis of Chloroplast Structures Associated with Virus Infection
<p>Chloroplasts are multifunctional organelles whose morphology is affected by environmental stresses. Although the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es has been reported previously, a 3D visualization of chloroplast under stress has not been explored. In this work, we used a positive-strand RNA ((+)RNA) virus, barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) to observe chloroplast structural changes during infection by electron tomography. The analyses revealed remodeling of the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es, characterized by the clustering of outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e-invaginated spherules in inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e-derived packets. Diverse morphologies of cytoplasmic invaginations (CIs) were evident with spherules at the periphery and different sized openings connecting the CIs to the cytoplasm. Immunoelectron microscopy of these viral components verified that the aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e structures were sites for BSMV replication. The BSMV αa replication protein localized at the surface of the chloroplasts and played a prominent role in eliciting chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e rearrangements. In sum, our results have revealed the 3D structure of the chloroplasts induced by BSMV infection. These findings contribute to our understanding of chloroplast morphological changes under stress conditions and during assembly of plant (+)RNA virus replication complexes.</p>

Deubiquitinating Enzyme OTU5 Contributes to DNA Methylation Patterns and Is Critical for Phosphate Nutrition Signals
<p>Phosphate (Pi) starvation induces a suite of adaptive responses aimed at recalibrating cellular Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s. Plants harboring a mutation in <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) showed altered DNA methylation of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>-related genes and altered Pi-responsive root traits. Unlike the wild type, homozygous <i>otu5</i> mutants did not respond to Pi starvation by increased lateral root formation and increased root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> length but formed very short root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s when grown on low-Pi media. Under Pi-replete conditions, <i>otu5</i> plants developed more root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s than the wild type due to attenuated primary root growth, a phenotype that resembled that of Pi-deficient plants. Growth of plants on low-Pi media altered both H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation levels at the transcriptional start site of a subset of genes encoding key players in Pi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s, which was correlated with mRNA abundance changes of these genes. Pi starvation had a minor impact on DNA methylation. Differentially methylated regions were enriched in transposable elements, suggesting that DNA methylation associated with low Pi supply is required for maintaining genome integrity. It is concluded that DNA methylation and histone methylation constitute critical, interdependent regulatory components that orchestrate the activity of a subset of Pi-responsive genes.</p>

Clathrin Heavy Chain Subunits Coordinate Endo- and Exocytic Traffic and Affect Stomatal Movement
<p>The current model for vesicular traffic to and from the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e is accepted, but the molecular requirements for this coordination are not well defined. We have identified the <i>hot ABA-deficiency suppressor1</i> mutant, which has a stomatal function defect, as a <i>clathrin heavy chain1</i> (<i>CHC1</i>) mutant allele and show that it has a decreased rate of endocytosis and growth defects that are shared with other <i>chc1</i> mutant alleles. We used <i>chc1</i> alleles and the related <i>chc2</i> mutant as tools to investigate the effects that clathrin defects have on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion pathways and plant growth. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion and endocytosis at the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e are sensitive to CHC1 and CHC2 function in seedling roots and that <i>chc</i> mutants have physiological defects in stomatal function and plant growth that have not been described previously. These findings suggest that clathrin supports specific functions in multiple cell types. Stomata movement and gas exchange are altered in <i>chc</i> mutants, indicating that clathrin is important for stomatal regulation. The aberrant function of <i>chc</i> mutant stomata is consistent with the growth phenotypes observed under different water and light conditions, which also are similar to those of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ory SNARE mutant, <i>syp121</i>. The <i>syp121</i> and <i>chc</i> mutants have impaired endocytosis and exocytosis compared with the wild type, indicating a link between SYP121-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">secret</span></strong>ion and clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e. Our findings provide evidence that clathrin and SYP121 functions are important for the coordination of endocytosis and exocytosis and have an impact on stomatal function, gas exchange, and vegetative growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

A Light Harvesting Complex-Like Protein in Maintenance of Photosynthetic Components in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>
<p>Using a genetic approach, we have identified and characterized a novel protein, named Msf1 (Maintenance factor for photosystem I), that is required for the maintenance of specific components of the photosynthetic apparatus in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Msf1 belongs to the superfamily of light-harvesting complex proteins with three trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e domains and consensus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding sites. Loss of Msf1 leads to reduced accumulation of photosystem I and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins/complexes. Msf1is a component of a thylakoid complex containing key enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, thus revealing a possible link between Msf1 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l biosynthesis. Protein interaction assays and greening experiments demonstrate that Msf1 interacts with Copper target homolog1 (CHL27B) and accumulates concomitantly with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, implying that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l stabilizes Msf1. Contrary to other light-harvesting complex-like genes, the expression of <i>Msf1</i> is not stimulated by high-light stress, but its protein level increases significantly under heat shock, iron and copper limitation, as well as in stationary cells. Based on these results, we propose that Msf1 is required for the maintenance of photosystem I and specific protein-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l complexes especially under certain stress conditions.</p>

Analysis of Exocyst Subunit EXO70 Family Reveals Distinct Membrane Polar Domains in Tobacco Pollen Tubes
<p>The vesicle-tethering complex exocyst is one of the crucial cell polarity regulators. The EXO70 subunit is required for the targeting of the complex and is represented by many isoforms in angiosperm plant cells. This diversity could be partly responsible for the establishment and maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e domains with different composition. To address this hypothesis, we employed the growing pollen tube, a well-established cell polarity model system, and performed large-scale expression, localization, and functional analysis of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) EXO70 isoforms. Various isoforms localized to different regions of the pollen tube plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e, apical vesicle-rich inverted cone region, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The overexpression of major pollen-expressed EXO70 isoforms resulted in growth arrest and characteristic phenotypic deviations of tip swelling and apical invaginations. NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 occupied two distinct and mutually exclusive plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e domains. Both isoforms partly colocalized with the exocyst subunit NtSEC3a at the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e, possibly forming different exocyst complex subpopulations. NtEXO70A1a localized to the small area previously characterized as the site of exocytosis in the tobacco pollen tube, while NtEXO70B1 surprisingly colocalized with the zone of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Both NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 colocalized to different degrees with markers for the anionic signaling phospholipids phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid. In contrast, members of the EXO70 C class, which are specifically expressed in tip-growing cells, exhibited exocytosis-related functional effects in pollen tubes despite the absence of apparent plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e localization. Taken together, our data support the existence of multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e-trafficking domains regulated by different EXO70-containing exocyst complexes within a single cell.</p>

ABA Suppresses Root Hair Growth via the OBP4 Transcriptional Regulator
<p>Plants modify organ growth and tune morphogenesis in response to various endogenous and environmental cues. At the cellular level, organ growth is often adjusted by alterations in cell growth, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this control remain poorly understood. In this study, we identify the DNA BINDING WITH ONE FINGER (DOF)-type transcription regulator OBF BINDING PROTEIN4 (OBP4) as a repressor of cell growth. Ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inhibits cell growth, resulting in severe dwarfism and the repression of genes involved in the regulation of water transport, root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> development, and stress responses. Among the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors known to control root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth, OBP4 binds the <i>ROOT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> DEFECTIVE6-LIKE2</i> (<i>RSL2</i>) promoter to repress its expression. The accumulation of OBP4 proteins is detected in expanding root epidermal cells, and its expression level is increased by the application of abscisic acid (ABA) at concentrations sufficient to inhibit root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth. ABA-dependent induction of <i>OBP4</i> is associated with the reduced expression of <i>RSL2</i>. Furthermore, ectopic expression of <i>OBP4</i> or loss of <i>RSL2</i> function results in ABA-insensitive root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth. Taken together, our results suggest that OBP4-mediated transcriptional repression of <i>RSL2</i> contributes to the ABA-dependent inhibition of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> growth in Arabidopsis.</p>

Distinct Mechanisms of the ORANGE Protein in Controlling Carotenoid Flux
<p>β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>e adds nutritious value and determines the color of many fruits, including melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>). In melon mesocarp, β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>e accumulation is governed by the <i>Orange</i> gene (<i>CmOr</i>) golden single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) through a yet to be discovered mechanism. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), OR increases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid levels by posttranscriptionally regulating phytoene synthase (PSY). Here, we identified a <i>CmOr</i> nonsense mutation (<i>Cmor</i>-lowβ) that lowered fruit β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>e levels with impaired chromoplast biogenesis. <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ exerted a minimal effect on <i>PSY</i> transcripts but dramatically decreased PSY protein levels and enzymatic activity, leading to reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid metabolic flux and accumulation. However, the golden SNP was discovered to not affect PSY protein levels and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid metabolic flux in melon fruit, as shown by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid and immunoblot analyses of selected melon genotypes and by using chemical pathway inhibitors. The high β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>e accumulation in golden SNP melons was found to be due to a reduced further metabolism of β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>e. This was revealed by genetic studies with double mutants including <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid isomerase</i> (<i>yofi</i>), a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid-isomerase nonsense mutant, which arrests the turnover of prolycopene. The <i>yofi</i> F2 segregants accumulated prolycopene independently of the golden SNP. Moreover, <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ was found to inhibit chromoplast formation and chloroplast disintegration in fruits from 30 d after anthesis until ripening, suggesting that <i>CmOr</i> regulates the chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition. Taken together, our results demonstrate that <i>CmOr</i> is required to achieve PSY protein levels to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid biosynthesis metabolic flux but that the mechanism of the <i>CmOr</i> golden SNP involves an inhibited metabolism downstream of β-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>e to dramatically affect both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caroten</span></strong>oid content and plastid fate.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain ion and water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s, thereby ensuring muscular function and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relationship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e potential of excitable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">homeostasi</span></strong>s had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Accurate computational design of multipass transmembrane proteins
<p>The computational design of trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proteins with more than one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e-spanning region remains a major challenge. We report the design of trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e monomers, homodimers, trimers, and tetramers with 76 to 215 residue subunits containing two to four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e-spanning regions and up to 860 total residues that adopt the target oligomerization state in detergent solution. The designed proteins localize to the plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e in bacteria and in mammalian cells, and magnetic tweezer unfolding experiments in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e indicate that they are very stable. Crystal structures of the designed dimer and tetramer—a rocket-shaped structure with a wide cytoplasmic base that funnels into eight trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e helices—are very close to the design models. Our results pave the way for the design of multispan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proteins with new functions.</p>

Membrane protein insertion through a mitochondrial β-barrel gate
<p>The biogenesis of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and Gram-negative bacteria requires the insertion of β-barrel proteins into the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es. Homologous Omp85 proteins are essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e insertion of β-barrel precursors. It is unknown if precursors are threaded through the Omp85-channel interior and exit laterally or if they are translocated into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e at the Omp85-lipid interface. We have mapped the interaction of a precursor in transit with the mitochondrial Omp85-channel Sam50 in the native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e environment. The precursor is translocated into the channel interior, interacts with an internal loop, and inserts into the lateral gate by β-signal exchange. Transport through the Omp85-channel interior followed by release through the lateral gate into the lipid phase may represent a basic mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e insertion of β-barrel proteins.</p>

OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 Form a Transient Functional Complex with the Photosystem II Reaction Center
<p>The reaction center (RC) of photosystem II (PSII), which is composed of D1, D2, PsbI, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytochrom</span></strong>e <i>b559</i> subunits, forms at an early stage of PSII biogenesis. However, it is largely unclear how these components assemble to form a functional unit. In this work, we show that synthesis of the PSII core proteins D1/D2 and formation of the PSII RC is blocked specifically in the absence of ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) and OHP2 proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), indicating that OHP1 and OHP2 are essential for the formation of the PSII RC. Mutagenesis of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding residues in OHP proteins impairs their function and/or stability, suggesting that they may function in the binding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l in vivo. We further show that OHP1, OHP2, and HIGH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>L FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244), together with D1, D2, PsbI, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cytochrom</span></strong>e <i>b559</i>, form a complex. We designated this complex the PSII RC-like complex to distinguish it from the RC subcomplex in the intact PSII complex. Our data imply that OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are present in this PSII RC-like complex for a limited time at an early stage of PSII de novo assembly and of PSII repair under high-light conditions. In a subsequent stage of PSII biogenesis, OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are released from the PSII RC-like complex and replaced by the other PSII subunits. Together with previous reports on the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i>, our results demonstrate that the process of PSII RC assembly is highly conserved among photosynthetic species.</p>

Inhibition of TOR Represses Nutrient Consumption, Which Improves Greening after Extended Periods of Etiolation
<p>Upon illumination, etiolated seedlings experience a transition from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic growth. During this process, the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway provides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l for photosynthesis. This pathway has to be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of photoreactive metabolites and to provide stoichiometric amounts of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l for its incorporation into photosynthetic protein complexes. Therefore, plants have evolved regulatory mechanisms to synchronize the biosynthesis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l-binding proteins. Two phytochrome-interacting factors (PIF1 and PIF3) and the DELLA proteins, which are controlled by the gibberellin pathway, are key regulators of this process. Here, we show that impairment of TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), either by mutation of the TOR complex component <i>RAPTOR1B</i> or by treatment with TOR inhibitors, leads to a significantly reduced accumulation of the photoreactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l precursor proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>lide in darkness but an increased greening rate of etiolated seedlings after exposure to light. Detailed profiling of metabolic, transcriptomic, and physiological parameters revealed that the TOR-repressed lines not only grow slower, they grow in a nutrient-saving mode, which allows them to resist longer periods of low nutrient availability. Our results also indicated that <i>RAPTOR1B</i> acts upstream of the gibberellin-DELLA pathway and its mutation complements the repressed greening phenotype of <i>pif1</i> and <i>pif3</i> after etiolation.</p>

Identification of Functional Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Affecting Leaf Hair Number in <i>Brassica rapa</i>
<p>Leaf traits affect plant agronomic performance; for example, leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> number provides a morphological indicator of drought and insect resistance. <i>Brassica rapa</i> crops have diverse phenotypes, and many <i>B. rapa</i> single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified and used as molecular markers for plant breeding. However, which SNPs are functional for leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> traits and, therefore, effective for breeding purposes remains unknown. Here, we identify a set of SNPs in the <i>B. rapa</i> ssp. <i>pekinenesis</i> candidate gene <i>Brp<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>Y LEAVES1</i> (<i>BrpHL1</i>) and a number of SNPs of <i>BrpHL1</i> in a natural population of 210 <i>B. rapa</i> accessions that have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>y, margin-only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>y, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>less leaves. <i>BrpHL1</i> genes and their orthologs and paralogs have many SNPs. By intensive mutagenesis and genetic transformation, we selected the functional SNPs for leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s by the exclusion of nonfunctional SNPs and the orthologous and paralogous genes. The residue tryptophan-92 of BrpHL1a was essential for direct interaction with GLABROUS3 and, thus, necessary for the formation of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>s. The accessions with the functional SNP leading to substitution of the tryptophan-92 residue had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>less leaves. The orthologous <i>BrcHL1b</i> from <i>B. rapa</i> ssp. <i>chinensis</i> regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong> formation on leaf margins rather than leaf surfaces. The selected SNP for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hair</span></strong>y phenotype could be adopted as a molecular marker for insect resistance in <i>Brassica</i> spp. crops. Moreover, the procedures optimized here can be used to explain the molecular mechanisms of natural variation and to facilitate the molecular breeding of many crops.</p>

Stable Accumulation of Photosystem II Requires ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) of the Light Harvesting-Like Family
<p>The cellular functions of two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) one-helix proteins, OHP1 and OHP2 (also named LIGHT-HARVESTING-LIKE2 [LIL2] and LIL6, respectively, because they have sequence similarity to light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>-binding proteins), remain unclear. Tagged null mutants of <i>OHP1</i> and <i>OHP2</i> (<i>ohp1</i> and <i>ohp2</i>) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>e proteins revealed that <i>ohp1</i> deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core protein function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core proteins; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic <i>ohp1</i> plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc proteins developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 proteins in transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">membran</span></strong>es, where it formed protein complexes with both OHP2 and High <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chlorophyl</span></strong>l Fluorescence244 (HCF244). We also found PSII core proteins D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other plant-specific proteins associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly. OHP1 interacted directly with HCF244 in the complex. Therefore, OHP1 and HCF244 play important roles in the stable accumulation of PSII.</p>

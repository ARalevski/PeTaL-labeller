Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual recognition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>es, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>es in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial coloration and morphology of one sex or species with the leg coloration of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the color pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>es (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male recognition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>e for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>e for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with coloration and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>es. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

Genome sequence of <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314
<p>Awamori is a traditional distilled beverage made from steamed Thai-Indica rice in Okinawa, Japan. For brewing the liquor, two microbes, local kuro (black) koji <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong> <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> and awamori yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> are involved. In contrast, that yeasts are used for ethanol fermentation throughout the world, a characteristic of Japanese fermentation industries is the use of <i>Aspergillus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>s as a source of enzymes for the maceration and saccharification of raw materials. Here we report the draft genome of a kuro (black) koji <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>, <i>A. luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314 (RIB 2604). The total length of nonredundant sequences was nearly 34.7 Mb, comprising approximately 2,300 contigs with 16 telomere-like sequences. In total, 11,691 genes were predicted to encode proteins. Most of the housekeeping genes, such as transcription factors and <i>N</i>-and <i>O</i>-glycosylation system, were conserved with respect to <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>. An alternative oxidase and acid-stable α-amylase regarding citric acid production and fermentation at a low pH as well as a unique glutamic peptidase were also found in the genome. Furthermore, key biosynthetic gene clusters of ochratoxin A and fumonisin B were absent when compared with <i>A. niger</i> genome, showing the safety of <i>A. luchuensis</i> for food and beverage production. This genome information will facilitate not only comparative genomics with industrial kuro-koji <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>s, but also molecular breeding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>s in improvements of awamori fermentation.</p>

Self-assembly of genetically encoded DNA-protein hybrid nanoscale shapes
<p>We describe an approach to bottom-up fabrication that allows integration of the functional diversity of proteins into designed three-dimensional structural frameworks. A set of custom staple proteins based on transcription activator–like effector proteins folds a double-stranded DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>e into a user-defined shape. Each staple protein is designed to recognize and closely link two distinct double-helical DNA sequences at separate positions on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>e. We present design rules for constructing megadalton-scale DNA-protein hybrid shapes; introduce various structural motifs, such as custom curvature, corners, and vertices; and describe principles for creating multilayer DNA-protein objects with enhanced rigidity. We demonstrate self-assembly of our hybrid nanostructures in one-pot mixtures that include the genetic information for the designed proteins, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>e DNA, RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and cofactors for transcription and translation.</p>

Artifactual mutations resulting from DNA lesions limit detection levels in ultrasensitive sequencing applications
<p>The need in cancer research or evolutionary biology to detect rare mutations or variants present at very low frequencies (<10<sup>−5</sup>) poses an increasing demand on lowering the detection limits of available methods. Here we demonstrated that amplifiable DNA lesions introduce important error sources in ultrasensitive technologies such as single molecule PCR (smPCR) applications (e.g. droplet-digital PCR), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) based methods. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>es with known amplifiable lesions (8-oxoguanine, deaminated 5-methylcytosine, uracil, and DNA heteroduplexes), we assessed with smPCR and duplex sequencing that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>es with these lesions were amplified very efficiently by proofreading polymerases (except uracil), leading to G->T, and to a lesser extent, to unreported G->C substitutions at 8-oxoguanine lesions, and C->T transitions in amplified uracil containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>es. Long heat incubations common in many DNA extraction protocols significantly increased the number of G->T substitutions. Moreover, in ∼50-80% smPCR reactions we observed the random amplification preference of only one of both DNA strands explaining the known ‘PCR jackpot effect’, with the result that a lesion became indistinguishable from a true mutation or variant. Finally, we showed that artifactual mutations derived from uracil and 8-oxoguanine could be significantly reduced by DNA repair enzymes.</p>

Factors influencing meiotic recombination revealed by whole-genome sequencing of single sperm
<p>Recombination is critical to meiosis and evolution, yet many aspects of the physical exchange of DNA via crossovers remain poorly understood. We report an approach for single-cell whole-genome DNA sequencing by which we sequenced 217 individual hybrid mouse sperm, providing a kilobase-resolution genome-wide map of crossovers. Combining this map with molecular assays measuring stages of recombination, we identified factors that affect crossover probability, including PRDM9 binding on the non-initiating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>e homolog and telomere proximity. These factors also influence the time for sites of recombination-initiating DNA double-strand breaks to find and engage their homologs, with rapidly engaging sites more likely to form crossovers. We show that chromatin environment on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>e homolog affects positioning of crossover breakpoints. Our results also offer insights into recombination in the pseudoautosomal region.</p>

Aberrant choice behavior in alcoholism
<p>More than 2 billion people worldwide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong>ly drink alcohol. Alcohol is a component cause of more than 200 diseases and causes ∼3.3 million deaths per year globally (<i>1</i>). The major disease burden comes from harmful alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence. Not everyone who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong>ly consumes alcohol becomes dependent: ∼15% become engaged in harmful and compulsive alcohol drinking (<i>2</i>). Patients suffering from alcohol dependence no longer have the freedom to choose between alternative rewards because alcohol drinking dictates what should be done next, namely, shaping activities for the next drink. On page 1321 of this issue, Augier <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that aberrant choice behavior—that is, choosing alcohol over an alternative reward—is a key driver for the transition from controlled to compulsive alcohol use. They also provide a mechanistic understanding of this aberrant choice behavior that could lead to new treatment opportunities.</p>

Sterilizing immunity in the lung relies on targeting fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death
<p>Humans inhale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong> conidia daily and typically experience lifelong asymptomatic clearance. Conidial germination into tissue-invasive hyphae can occur in individuals with defects in myeloid function, although the mechanism of myeloid cell–mediated immune surveillance remains unclear. By monitoring fungal physiology in vivo, we demonstrate that lung neutrophils trigger programmed cell death with apoptosis-like features in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia, the most prevalent human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong> pathogen. An antiapoptotic protein, AfBIR1, opposes this process by inhibiting fungal caspase activation and DNA fragmentation in the murine lung. Genetic and pharmacologic studies indicate that AfBIR1 expression and activity underlie conidial susceptibility to NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase-dependent killing and, in turn, host susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis. Immune surveillance exploits a fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death pathway to maintain sterilizing immunity in the lung.</p>

Developmental Changes in Scots Pine Transcriptome during Heartwood Formation
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) wood is desired in woodworking industries due to its favorable timber characteristics and natural durability that is contributed by heartwood extractives. It has been discussed whether the Scots pine heartwood extractives (mainly stilbenes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resin</span></strong> acids) are synthesized in the cells of the transition zone between sapwood and heartwood, or if they are transported from the sapwood. Timing of heartwood formation during the yearly cycle has also not been unambiguously defined. We measured steady-state mRNA levels in Scots pine transition zone and sapwood using RNA sequencing. Year-round expression profiles of selected transcripts were further investigated by quantitative RT-PCR. Differentially accumulating transcripts suggest that, of the Scots pine heartwood extractives, stilbenes are synthesized in situ in the transition zone and gain their carbon-skeletons from Suc and triglycerides. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resin</span></strong> acids, on the other hand, are synthesized early in the spring mainly in the sapwood, meaning that they must be transported to the heartwood transition zone. Heartwood formation is marked by programmed cell death that occurs during the summer months in the transition zone.</p>

Predicting human olfactory perception from chemical features of odor molecules
<p>It is still not possible to predict whether a given molecule will have a perceived odor or what olfactory percept it will produce. We therefore organized the crowd-sourced DREAM Olfaction Prediction Challenge. Using a large olfactory psychophysical data set, teams developed machine-learning algorithms to predict sensory attributes of molecules based on their chemoinformatic features. The resulting models accurately predicted odor intensity and pleasantness and also successfully predicted 8 among 19 rated semantic descriptors (“garlic,” “fish,” “sweet,” “fruit,” “burnt,” “spices,” “flower,” and “sour”). Regularized linear models performed nearly as well as random forest–based ones, with a predictive accuracy that closely approaches a key theoretical limit. These models help to predict the perceptual qualities of virtually any molecule with high accuracy and also reverse-engineer the smell of a molecule.</p>

Solving the quantum many-body problem with artificial neural networks
<p>The challenge posed by the many-body problem in quantum physics originates from the difficulty of describing the nontrivial correlations encoded in the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function. Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with a variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme we demonstrate is capable of both finding the ground state and describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. Our approach achieves high accuracy in describing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prototyp</span></strong>ical interacting spins models in one and two dimensions.</p>

Fault activation by hydraulic fracturing in western Canada
<p>Hydraulic fracturing has been inferred to trigger the majority of injection-induced earthquakes in western Canada, in contrast to the Midwestern United States, where massive saltwater disposal is the dominant triggering mechanism. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>e-based earthquake catalog from a seismically active Canadian shale play, combined with comprehensive injection data during a 4-month interval, shows that earthquakes are tightly clustered in space and time near hydraulic fracturing sites. The largest event [moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>W</sub>) 3.9] occurred several weeks after injection along a fault that appears to extend from the injection zone into crystalline basement. Patterns of seismicity indicate that stress changes during operations can activate fault slip to an offset distance of >1 km, whereas pressurization by hydraulic fracturing into a fault yields episodic seismicity that can persist for months.</p>

Atom-by-atom assembly of defect-free one-dimensional cold atom arrays

We use atom-by-atom assembly to implement a platform for the deterministic preparation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong> one-dimensional arrays of individually controlled cold atoms. In our approach, a measurement and feedback procedure eliminates the entropy associated with probabilistic trap occupation and results in defect-free arrays of more than 50 atoms in less than 400 milliseconds. The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers, which we use to arrange atoms in desired geometric patterns and to maintain these configurations by replacing lost atoms with surplus atoms from a reservoir. This bottom-up approach may enable controlled engineering of scalable many-body systems for quantum information processing, quantum simulations, and precision measurements.</p>

Systematic mapping of functional enhancer–promoter connections with CRISPR interference
<p>Gene expression in mammals is regulated by noncoding elements that can affect physiology and disease, yet the functions and target genes of most noncoding elements remain unknown. We present a high-throughput approach that uses clustered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong>ly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference (CRISPRi) to discover regulatory elements and identify their target genes. We assess >1 megabase of sequence in the vicinity of two essential transcription factors, <i>MYC</i> and <i>GATA1</i>, and identify nine distal enhancers that control gene expression and cellular proliferation. Quantitative features of chromatin state and chromosome conformation distinguish the seven enhancers that regulate <i>MYC</i> from other elements that do not, suggesting a strategy for predicting enhancer–promoter connectivity. This CRISPRi-based approach can be applied to dissect transcriptional networks and interpret the contributions of noncoding genetic variation to human disease.</p>

Deterministic generation of a cluster state of entangled photons

We use semiconductor quantum dots to deterministically generate long strings of polarization-entangled photons in a cluster state by periodic timed excitation of a precessing matter qubit. In each period, an entangled photon is added to the cluster state formed by the matter qubit and the previously emitted photons. In our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prototyp</span></strong>e device, the qubit is the confined dark exciton, and it produces strings of hundreds of photons in which the entanglement persists over five sequential photons.

The Amino Acid Permease 5 (OsAAP5) Regulates Tiller Number and Grain Yield in Rice
<p>As fundamental nutrients, amino acids are important for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) growth and development. Here, we identified the amino acid permease 5 (OsAAP5), that regulates tiller number and grain yield in rice. The <i>OsAAP5</i> promoter sequence differed between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties. Lower expression of <i>OsAAP5</i> in the young leaf blade in <i>indica</i> varieties than in <i>japonica</i> varieties was associated with more tillers in <i>indica</i> than in <i>japonica</i>. Down-regulation of <i>OsAAP5</i> expression in <i>japonica</i> using RNA interference (RNAi) and clustered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong>ly interspaced short palindromic repeats led to increases in tiller number and grain yield, whereas <i>OsAAP5</i> overexpression (OE) had the opposite effect. Both a protoplast amino acid uptake assay and HPLC analysis indicated that more basic (Lys, Arg) and neutral (Val, Ala) amino acids were transported and accumulated in the OE lines than in the wild type, but the opposite was observed in the RNAi lines. Furthermore, exogenous application of Lys, Arg, Val, and Ala in the OE lines substantially inhibited tiller bud elongation, but the effect was lost in the RNAi lines. Notably, concentrations of the cytokinins cis-zeatin and dihydrozeatin were much lower in the OE lines than in the wild type, whereas concentrations in the RNAi lines were higher. Thus, <i>OsAAP5</i> could regulate tiller bud outgrowth by affecting cytokinin levels, and knockout of <i>OsAAP5</i> could be valuable for <i>japonica</i> breeding programs seeking high yield and grain quality.</p>

An Essential Role for miRNA167 in Maternal Control of Embryonic and Seed Development
<p>Maternal cells play a critical role in ensuring the normal development of embryos, endosperms, and seeds. Mutations that disrupt the maternal control of embryogenesis and seed development are difficult to identify. Here, we completely deleted four <i>MICRORNA167</i> (<i>MIR167</i>) genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a clustered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong>ly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein9 (Cas9) genome-editing technology. We found that plants with a deletion of <i>MIR167A</i> phenocopied plants overexpressing miRNA167-resistant versions of <i>Auxin Response Factor6</i> (<i>ARF6</i>) or <i>ARF8</i>, two miRNA167 targets. Both the <i>mir167a</i> mutant and the <i>ARF</i> overexpression lines were defective in anther dehiscence and ovule development. Serendipitously, we found that the <i>mir167a</i> (♀) × wild type (♂) crosses failed to produce normal embryos and endosperms, despite the findings that embryos with either <i>mir167a<sup>+/−</sup></i> or <i>mir167a<sup>−/−</sup></i> genotypes developed normally when <i>mir167a<sup>+/−</sup></i> plants were self-pollinated, revealing a central role of <i>MIR167A</i> in maternal control of seed development. The <i>mir167a</i> phenotype is 100% penetrant, providing a great genetic tool for studying the roles of miRNAs and auxin in maternal control. Moreover, we found that <i>mir167a</i> mutants flowered significantly later than wild-type plants, a phenotype that was not observed in the <i>ARF</i> overexpression lines. We show that the reproductive defects of <i>mir167a</i> mutants were suppressed by a decrease of activities of <i>ARF6</i>, <i>ARF8</i>, or both. Our results clearly demonstrate that <i>MIR167A</i> is the predominant <i>MIR167</i> member in regulating Arabidopsis reproduction and that <i>MIR167A</i> acts as a maternal gene that functions largely through <i>ARF6</i> and <i>ARF8</i>.</p>

The AAA-ATPase MIDASIN 1 Functions in Ribosome Biogenesis and Is Essential for Embryo and Root Development
<p>Ribosome biogenesis is an orchestrated process that relies on many assembly factors. The AAA-ATPase Midasin 1 (Mdn1) functions as a ribosome assembly factor in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>), but the roles of MDN1 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we showed that the Arabidopsis null mutant of <i>MDN1</i> is embryo-lethal. Using the weak mutant <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i>, which maintains viability, we found that MDN1 is critical for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong> pattern of auxin maxima in the globular embryo and functions in root meristem maintenance. By detecting the subcellular distribution of ribosome proteins, we noted that <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> impairs nuclear export of the pre-60S ribosomal particle. The processing of ribosomal precusor RNAs, including 35S, 27SB, and 20S, is also affected in this mutant. MDN1 physically interacts with PESCADILLO2 (PES2), an essential assembly factor of the 60S ribosome, and the observed mislocalization of PES2 in <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> further implied that MDN1 plays an indispensable role in 60S ribosome biogenesis. Therefore, the observed hypersensitivity of <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> to a eukaryotic translation inhibitor and high-sugar conditions might be associated with the defect in ribosome biogenesis. Overall, this work establishes a role of Arabidopsis MDN1 in ribosome biogenesis, which agrees with its roles in embryogenesis and root development.</p>

OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation, and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes

Here, we functionally characterized a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) Pi transporter, Os Phosphate Transporter-1;3 (OsPHT1;3), that mediates Pi uptake, translocation, and remobilization. <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was directly regulated by Os Phosphate Starvation Response-2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades. OsPHT1;3 was able to complement a yeast mutant strain defective in five Pi transporters and mediate Pi influx in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. Overexpression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots. However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members that facilitate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation only when external Pi concentration was below 5 μ<sc>m</sc>. Moreover, in basal nodes, the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was restricted to the phloem of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong> vascular bundles and enlarged vascular bundles. An isotope labeling experiment with <sup>32</sup>P showed that <i>ospht1</i>;<i>3</i> mutant lines were impaired in remobilization of Pi from source to sink leaves. Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>2</i> and several other <i>OsPHT1</i> genes. Yeast-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated a physical interaction between OsPHT1;3 and OsPHT1;2. Taken together, our results indicate that OsPHT1;3 acts as a crucial factor for Pi acquisition, root-to-shoot Pi translocation, and redistribution of phosphorus in plants growing in environments with extremely low Pi levels.</p>

CLASP Facilitates Transitions between Cortical Microtubule Array Patterns
<p>Acentrosomal plant microtubule arrays form patterns at the cell cortex that influence cellular morphogenesis by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>ing the deposition of cell wall materials, but the molecular basis by which the microtubules form the cortical array patterns remains largely unknown. Loss of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) microtubule-associated protein, CYTOPLASMIC LINKER ASSOCIATED PROTEIN (AtCLASP), results in cellular growth anisotropy defects in hypocotyl cells. We examined the microtubule array patterning in <i>atclasp-1</i> null mutants and discovered a significant defect in the timing of transitions between array patterns but no substantive defect in the array patterns per se. Detailed analysis and computational modeling of the microtubule dynamics in two <i>atclasp-1</i> fluorescent tubulin marker lines revealed marker-dependent effects on depolymerization and catastrophe frequency predicted to alter the steady-state microtubule population. Quantitative in vivo analysis of the underlying microtubule array architecture showed that AtCLASP is required to maintain the number of growing microtubule plus ends during transitions between array patterns. We propose that AtCLASP plays a critical role in cellular morphogenesis through actions on new microtubules that facilitate array transitions.</p>

The Mitochondrial Endonuclease M20 Participates in the Down-Regulation of Mitochondrial DNA in Pollen Cells
<p>Maintaining the appropriate number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules is crucial for supporting mitochondrial metabolism and function in both plant and animal cells. For example, a substantial decrease in mtDNA levels occurs as a key part of pollen development. The molecular mechanisms regulating mtDNA copy number are largely unclear, particularly with regard to those that reduce mtDNA levels. Here, we identified and purified a 20-kD endonuclease, M20, from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen mitochondria. We found M20 to be an His-Asn-His/Asn (H-N-H/N) nuclease that degrades linear and circular DNA in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtM20, which shared high sequence similarity with maize M20, localized to the mitochondria, had a similar H-N-H/N structure, and degraded both linear and circular DNA. <i>AtM20</i> transcript levels increased during pollen development, in parallel with a rapid reduction in mtDNA. Clustered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong>ly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome-editing techniques were used to generate knockout lines of <i>AtM20</i> (<i>atm20</i>), which exhibited a significant delay in the reduction in mtDNA levels in pollen vegetative cells but normal mtDNA levels in somatic cells. The delayed reduction in pollen mtDNA levels was rescued by the transgenic expression of <i>AtM20</i> in <i>atm20</i> plants. This study thus uncovers an endonucleolytic DNase in plant mitochondria and its crucial role in reducing mtDNA levels, pointing to the complex mechanism regulating mtDNA levels in plants.</p>

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the environment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and environment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or averaged across individuals. Therefore, computational methods are used to reconstruct representative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prototyp</span></strong>es using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and calculating means. The same problem applies to the root system architecture (RSA) of plants. Several computer programs are available for extracting numerical data from root images, but they usually do not offer customized data analysis or visual reconstruction of RSA. We developed Root-VIS, a free software tool that facilitates the determination of means and variance of many different RSA features across user-selected sets of root images. Furthermore, Root-VIS offers several options to generate visual reconstructions of root systems from the averaged data to enable screening and modeling. We confirmed the suitability of Root-VIS, combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo, for the rapid characterization of genotype-environment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Editing of an Alpha-Kafirin Gene Family Increases, Digestibility and Protein Quality in Sorghum
<p>Kafirins are the major storage proteins in sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) grains and form protein bodies with poor digestibility. Since kafirins are devoid of the essential amino acid lysine, they also impart poor protein quality to the kernel. The α-kafirins, which make up most of the total kafirins, are largely encoded by the <i>k1C</i> family of highly similar genes. We used a clustered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong>ly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing approach to target the <i>k1C</i> genes to create variants with reduced kafirin levels and improved protein quality and digestibility. A single guide RNA was designed to introduce mutations in a conserved region encoding the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide of α-kafirins. Sequencing of kafirin PCR products revealed extensive edits in 25 of 26 events in one or multiple <i>k1C</i> family members. T1 and T2 seeds showed reduced α-kafirin levels, and selected T2 events showed significantly increased grain protein digestibility and lysine content. Thus, a single consensus single guide RNA carrying target sequence mismatches is sufficient for extensive editing of all <i>k1C</i> genes. The resulting quality improvements can be deployed rapidly for breeding and the generation of transgene-free, improved cultivars of sorghum, a major crop worldwide.</p>

Gradually Decreasing Starch Branching Enzyme Expression Is Responsible for the Formation of Heterogeneous Starch Granules
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is mainly occupied by homogeneous polygonal starch from inside to outside. However, morphologically different (heterogeneous) starches have been identified in some rice mutants. How these heterogeneous starches form remains unknown. A high-amylose rice line (TRS) generated through the antisense inhibition of <i>starch branching synthase I</i> (<i>SBEI</i>) and <i>SBEIIb</i> contains four heterogeneous starches: polygonal, aggregate, elongated, and hollow starch; these starches are regionally distributed in the endosperm from inside to outside. Here, we investigated the relationship between SBE dosage and the morphological architecture of heterogeneous starches in TRS endosperm from the view of the molecular structure of starch. The results indicated that their molecular structures underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong> changes, including gradually increasing true amylose content but decreasing amylopectin content and gradually increasing the ratio of amylopectin long chain but decreasing the ratio of amylopectin short chain. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) amounts in the four heterogeneous starches were not significantly different from each other, but SBEI, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb showed a gradually decreasing trend. Further immunostaining analysis revealed that the gradually decreasing SBEs acting on the formation of the four heterogeneous granules were mainly due to the spatial distribution of the three SBEs in the endosperm. It was suggested that the decreased amylopectin in starch might remove steric hindrance and provide extra space for abundant amylose accumulation when the GBSSI amount was not elevated. Furthermore, extra amylose coupled with altered amylopectin structure possibly led to morphological changes in heterogeneous granules.</p>

The RNA Editing Factor SlORRM4 Is Required for Normal Fruit Ripening in Tomato
<p>RNA editing plays a key posttranscriptional role in gene expression. Existing studies on cytidine-to-uridine RNA editing in plants have focused on maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the importance and regulation of RNA editing in several critical agronomic processes are not well understood, a notable example of which is fruit ripening. Here, we analyzed the expression profile of 33 RNA editing factors and identified 11 putative tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) fruit ripening-related factors. A rapid virus-induced gene silencing assay indicated that the organelle RNA recognition motif-containing protein SlORRM4 affected tomato fruit ripening. Knocking out SlORRM4 expression using a clustered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong>ly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome editing strategy delayed tomato fruit ripening by lowering respiratory rate and ethylene production. Additionally, the expression of numerous genes associated with fruit ripening and mitochondrial functions changed significantly when <i>SlORRM4</i> was knocked out. Moreover, the loss of <i>SlORRM4</i> function significantly reduced RNA editing of many mitochondrial transcripts, leading to low-level expression of some core subunits that are critical for mitochondrial complex assembly (i.e. Nad3, Cytc1, and COX II). Taken together, these results indicate that SlORRM4 is involved in RNA editing of transcripts in ripening fruit that influence mitochondrial function and key aspects of fruit ripening.</p>

Efficient Plastid Transformation in Arabidopsis
<p>Plastid transformation is routine in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) but 100-fold less frequent in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), preventing its use in plastid biology. A recent study revealed that null mutations in <i>ACC2</i>, encoding a plastid-targeted acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, cause hypersensitivity to spectinomycin. We hypothesized that plastid transformation efficiency should increase in the <i>acc2</i> background, because when ACC2 is absent, fatty acid biosynthesis becomes dependent on translation of the plastid-encoded ACC β-carboxylase subunit. We bombarded <i>ACC2</i>-defective Arabidopsis leaves with a vector carrying a selectable spectinomycin resistance (<i>aadA</i>) gene and <i>gfp</i>, encoding the green fluorescence protein GFP. Spectinomycin-resistant clones were identified as green cell clusters on a spectinomycin medium. Plastid transformation was confirmed by GFP accumulation from the second open reading frame of a polycistronic messenger RNA, which would not be translated in the cytoplasm. We obtained one to two plastid transformation events per bombarded sample in spectinomycin-hypersensitive Slavice and Columbia <i>acc2</i> knockout backgrounds, an approximately 100-fold enhanced plastid transformation frequency. Slavice and Columbia are accessions in which plant regeneration is uncharacterized or difficult to obtain. A practical system for Arabidopsis plastid transformation will be obtained by creating an <i>ACC2</i> null background in a regenerable Arabidopsis accession. The recognition that the duplicated ACCase in Arabidopsis is an impediment to plastid transformation provides a rational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>e to implement plastid transformation in related recalcitrant crops.</p>

Novel Stress-Inducible Antisense RNAs of Protein-Coding Loci Are Synthesized by RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase
<p>Our previous study identified approximately 6,000 abiotic stress-responsive noncoding transcripts existing on the antisense strand of protein-coding genes and implied that a type of antisense RNA was synthesized from a sense RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">templat</span></strong>e by <i>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</i> (<i>RDR</i>). Expression analyses revealed that the expression of novel abiotic stress-induced antisense RNA on 1,136 gene loci was reduced in the <i>rdr1/2/6</i> mutants. RNase protection indicated that the <i>RD29A</i> antisense RNA and other RDR1/2/6-dependent antisense RNAs are involved in the formation of dsRNA. The accumulation of stress-inducible antisense RNA was decreased and increased in <i>dcp5</i> and <i>xrn4</i>, respectively, but not changed in <i>dcl2/3/4</i>, <i>nrpd1a</i> and <i>nrpd1b</i>. RNA-seq analyses revealed that the majority of the RDR1/2/6-dependent antisense RNA loci did not overlap with RDR1/2/6-dependent 20–30 nt RNA loci. Additionally, <i>rdr1/2/6</i> mutants decreased the degradation rate of the sense RNA and exhibited arrested root growth during the recovery stage following a drought stress, whereas <i>dcl2/3/4</i> mutants did not. Collectively, these results indicate that RDRs have stress-inducible antisense RNA synthesis activity and a novel biological function that is different from the known endogenous small RNA pathways from protein-coding genes. These data reveal a novel mechanism of RNA regulation during abiotic stress response that involves complex RNA degradation pathways.</p>

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong>ly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis in plants enables the development of high-throughput mutagenesis strategies. By transforming pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were generated with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 targeted genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying targeted genes. Plants with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for generating a collection of lines with targeted mutations and should be applicable to any plant transformation system.</p>

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong>ly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem hydraulic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage loss of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its hydraulic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

SLiM 2: Flexible, Interactive Forward Genetic Simulations
<p>Modern population genomic datasets hold immense promise for revealing the evolutionary processes operating in natural populations, but a crucial prerequisite for this goal is the ability to model realistic evolutionary scenarios and predict their expected patterns in genomic data. To that end, we present SLiM 2: an evolutionary simulation framework that combines a powerful, fast engine for forward population genetic simulations with the capability of modeling a wide variety of complex evolutionary scenarios. SLiM achieves this flexibility through scriptability, which provides control over most aspects of the simulated evolutionary scenarios with a simple R-like scripting language called Eidos. An example SLiM simulation is presented to illustrate the power of this approach. SLiM 2 also includes a graphical user interface for simulation construction, interactive runtime control, and dynamic visualization of simulation output, facilitating easy and fast model development with quick <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prototyp</span></strong>ing and visual debugging. We conclude with a performance comparison between SLiM and two other popular forward genetic simulation packages.</p>

<p>Endothelia in the atrioventricular (AV) canal of the developing heart undergo a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prototyp</span></strong>ical epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) to begin heart valve formation. Using an <i>in vitro</i> invasion assay, an extracellular matrix protein, Olfactomedin-1 (OLFM1), was found to increase mesenchymal cell numbers in AV canals from embryonic chick hearts. Treatment with both anti-OLFM1 antibody and siRNA targeting OLFM1 inhibits mesenchymal cell formation. OLFM1 does not alter cell proliferation, migration or apoptosis. Dispersion, but lack of invasion in the presence of inhibiting antibody, identifies a specific role for OLFM1 in cell invasion during EMT. This role is conserved in other epithelia, as OLFM1 similarly enhances invasion by MDCK epithelial cells in a transwell assay. Synergy is observed when TGFβ2 and OLFM1 are added to MDCK cell cultures, indicating that OLFM-1 activity is cooperative with TGFβ. Inhibition of both OLFM1 and TGFβ in heart invasion assays shows a similar cooperative role during development. To explore OLFM1 activity during EMT, representative EMT markers were examined. Effects of OLFM1 protein and anti-OLFM1 on transcripts of cell-cell adhesion molecules and the transcription factors <i>Snail-1, Snail-2, Twist1</i> and <i>Sox-9</i> argue that OLFM1 does not initiate EMT. Rather, regulation of transcripts of <i>Zeb1</i> and <i>Zeb2</i>, secreted proteases and mesenchymal cell markers by both OLFM1 and anti-OLFM1 is consistent with regulation of the cell invasion step of EMT. We conclude that OLFM1 is present and necessary during EMT in the embryonic chick heart. Its role in cell invasion and mesenchymal cell gene regulation suggests an invasion checkpoint in EMT where OLFM1 acts to promote cell invasion into the three-dimensional matrix.</p>

Dynamic clonal analysis based on chronic <i>in vivo</i> imaging allows multiscale quantification of growth in the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc
<p>In the course of morphogenesis, tissues change shape and grow. How this is orchestrated is largely unknown, partly owing to the lack of experimental methods to visualize and quantify growth. Here, we describe a novel experimental approach to investigate the growth of tissues <i>in vivo</i> on a time-scale of days, as employed to study the <i>Drosophila</i> larval imaginal wing disc, the precursor of the adult wing. We developed a protocol to image wing discs at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong> intervals in living anesthetized larvae so as to follow the growth of the tissue over extended periods of time. This approach can be used to image cells at high resolution <i>in vivo</i>. At intermediate scale, we tracked the increase in cell number within clones as well as the changes in clone area and shape. At scales extending to the tissue level, clones can be used as landmarks for measuring strain, as a proxy for growth. We developed general computational tools to extract strain maps from clonal shapes and landmark displacements in individual tissues, and to combine multiple datasets into a mean strain. In the disc, we use these to compare properties of growth at the scale of clones (a few cells) and at larger regional scales.</p>

Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect development has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan development. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic development of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head development. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, developed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong> muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> development. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. Based on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

<i>ATML1</i> promotes epidermal cell differentiation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> shoots
<p>Molecular mechanisms that generate distinct tissue layers in plant shoots are not well understood. <i>ATML1</i>, an <i>Arabidopsis</i> homeobox gene, is expressed in the outermost cell layer, beginning at an early stage of development. The promoters of many epidermis-specific genes, including <i>ATML1</i>, contain an ATML1-binding site called an L1 box, suggesting that ATML1 regulates epidermal cell fate. Here, we show that overexpression of <i>ATML1</i> was sufficient to activate the expression of epidermal genes and to induce epidermis-related traits such as the formation of stomatal guard cells and trichome-like cells in non-epidermal seedling tissues. Detailed observation of the division planes of these ectopic stomatal cells suggested that a near-surface position, as well as epidermal cell identity, were required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regular</span></strong> anticlinal cell division, as seen in wild-type epidermis. Moreover, analyses of a loss-of-function mutant and overexpressors implied that differentiation of epidermal cells was associated with repression of mesophyll cell fate. Collectively, our studies contribute new information about the molecular basis of cell fate determination in different layers of plant aerial organs.</p>

Inhibition of JAK-STAT Signaling Suppresses Pathogenic Immune Responses in Medium and Large Vessel Vasculitis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Giant cell arteritis, a chronic autoimmune disease of the aorta and its large branches, is complicated by aneurysm formation, dissection, and arterial occlusions. Arterial wall dendritic cells attract CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages to form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prototyp</span></strong>ic granulomatous infiltrates. Vasculitic lesions contain a diverse array of effector T cells that persist despite corticosteroid therapy and sustain chronic, s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>ering vasculitis. Transmural inflammation induces microvascular neoangiogenesis and results in lumen-occlusive intimal hyperplasia. We have examined whether persistent vessel wall inflammation is maintained by lesional T cells, including the newly identified tissue-resident memory T cells, and whether such T cells are sensitive to the cytokine-signaling inhibitor tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor targeting JAK3 and JAK1.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Vascular inflammation was induced in human arteries engrafted into immunodeficient mice that were reconstituted with T cells and monocytes from patients with giant cell arteritis. Mice carrying inflamed human arteries were treated with tofacitinib or vehicle. Vasculitic arteries were examined for gene expression (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), protein expression (immunohistochemistry), and infiltrating cell populations (flow cytometry).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Tofacitinib effectively suppressed innate and adaptive immunity in the vessel wall. Lesional T cells responded to tofacitinib with reduced proliferation rates (<10%) and minimal production of the effector molecules interferon-γ, interleukin-17, and interleukin-21. Tofacitinib disrupted adventitial microvascular angiogenesis, reduced outgrowth of hyperplastic intima, and minimized CD4<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident memory T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cytokine signaling dependent on JAK3 and JAK1 is critically important in chronic inflammation of medium and large arteries. The JAK inhibitor tofacitinib effectively suppresses tissue-resident memory T cells and inhibits core vasculitogenic effector pathways.</p></sec>

Reversing the Cardiac Effects of Sedentary Aging in Middle Age—A Randomized Controlled Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. The development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised high-intensity exercise training on LV stiffness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention control (control; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by curve fit of the diastolic pressure-volume curve. Maximal oxygen uptake (Vo<sub>2</sub>max) was measured to quantify changes in fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. Vo<sub>2</sub>max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; control: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time <i>P</i><0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, <i>P</i>=0.0018), whereas there was no change in controls (group×time <i>P</i><0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, <i>P</i>=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-diastolic volume (group×time <i>P</i><0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was unchanged, providing greater stroke volume for any given filling pressure (loading×group×time <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and decreased cardiac stiffness. Regular exercise training may provide protection against the future risk of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction by preventing the increase in cardiac stiffness attributable to sedentary aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

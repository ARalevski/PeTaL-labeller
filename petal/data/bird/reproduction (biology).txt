Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the vegetative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from vegetative wall to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>ic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e genes reveals distinct vegetative and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>ic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the vegetative versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

<i>De novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing mouse embryos originating from enucleolated zygotes
<p>The large, compact oocyte nucleoli, sometimes referred to as nucleolus precursor bodies (NPBs), are essential for embryonic development in mammals; in their absence, the oocytes complete maturation and can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ized, but no nucleoli are formed in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e or embryo, leading to developmental failure. It has been convincingly documented that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es inherit the oocyte nucleolar material and form NPBs again in pronuclei. It is commonly accepted that during early embryonic development, the original compact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e NPBs gradually transform into reticulated nucleoli of somatic cells. Here, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e NPBs are not required for embryonic and full-term development in the mouse. When NPBs were removed from late-stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es by micromanipulation, the enucleolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es developed to the blastocyst stage and, after transfer to recipients, live pups were obtained. We also describe <i>de novo</i> formation of nucleoli in developing embryos. After removal of NPBs from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es, they formed new nucleoli after several divisions. These results indicate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e NPBs are not used in embryonic development and that the nucleoli in developing embryos originate from <i>de novo</i> synthesized materials.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

The Ly6/uPAR protein Bouncer is necessary and sufficient for species-specific fertilization
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization is fundamental for sexual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion, yet its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We found that an oocyte-expressed Ly6/uPAR protein, which we call Bouncer, is a crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization factor in zebrafish. Membrane-bound Bouncer mediates sperm-egg binding and is thus essential for sperm entry into the egg. Remarkably, Bouncer not only is required for sperm-egg interaction but is also sufficient to allow cross-species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization between zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that diverged more than 200 million years ago. Our study thus identifies Bouncer as a key determinant of species-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization in fish. Bouncer’s closest homolog in tetrapods, SPACA4, is restricted to the male germline in internally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>izing vertebrates, which suggests that our findings in fish have relevance to human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y.</p>

High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice
<p>Increased oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of oxidative damage during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion. We tested whether the link between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and antioxidative capacity. We studied the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion on OS in females of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR females showed higher oxidative damage to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR females. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion did not affect oxidative damage to lipids in either line; however, it reduced damage to DNA in L-BMR females. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion increased catalase activity in liver (significantly stronger in L-BMR females) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS.</p>

Cysteine-rich peptides promote interspecific genetic isolation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive isolation is a prerequisite for speciation. Failure of communication between female tissues of the pistil and paternal pollen tubes imposes hybridization barriers in flowering plants. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> LURE1 (AtLURE1) peptides and their male receptor PRK6 aid attraction of the growing pollen tube to the ovule. Here, we report that the knockout of the entire <i>AtLURE1</i> gene family did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity, indicating that AtLURE1-PRK6–mediated signaling is not required for successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization within one <i>Arabidopsis</i> species. AtLURE1s instead function as pollen tube emergence accelerators that favor conspecific pollen over pollen from other species and thus promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive isolation. We also identified maternal peptides XIUQIU1 to -4, which attract pollen tubes regardless of species. Cooperation between ovule attraction and pollen tube growth acceleration favors conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive isolation.</p>

Social regulation of insulin signaling and the evolution of eusociality in ants
<p>Queens and workers of eusocial Hymenoptera are considered homologous to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive and brood care phases of an ancestral subsocial life cycle. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive division of labor remain obscure. Using a brain transcriptomics screen, we identified a single gene, <i>insulin-like peptide 2</i> (<i>ilp2</i>), which is always up-regulated in ant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ives, likely because they are better nourished than their non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive nestmates. In clonal raider ants (<i>Ooceraea biroi</i>), larval signals inhibit adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion by suppressing <i>ilp2</i>, thus producing a colony <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive cycle reminiscent of ancestral subsociality. However, increasing ILP2 peptide levels overrides larval suppression, thereby breaking the colony cycle and inducing a stable division of labor. These findings suggest a simple model for the origin of ant eusociality via nutritionally determined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive asymmetries potentially amplified by larval signals.</p>

Multiplex recording of cellular events over time on CRISPR biological tape
<p>Although dynamics underlie many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes, our ability to robustly and accurately profile time-varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals and regulatory programs remains limited. Here we describe a framework for storing temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical information directly in the genomes of a cell population. We developed a “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical tape recorder” in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then recorded by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable recording over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously record the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical events on a large scale.</p>

Mitotic transcription and waves of gene reactivation during mitotic exit
<p>Although the genome is generally thought to be transcriptionally silent during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, technical limitations have prevented sensitive mapping of transcription during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s and mitotic exit. Thus, the means by which the interphase expression pattern is transduced to daughter cells have been unclear. We used 5-ethynyluridine to pulse-label transcripts during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s and mitotic exit and found that many genes exhibit transcription during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, as confirmed with fluorescein isothiocyanate–uridine 5′-triphosphate labeling, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The first round of transcription immediately after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s primarily activates genes involved in the growth and rebuilding of daughter cells, rather than cell type–specific functions. We propose that the cell’s transcription pattern is largely retained at a low level through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, whereas the amplitude of transcription observed in interphase is reestablished during mitotic exit.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering plants, the female gametophyte controls pollen tube reception immediately before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and regulates seed development immediately after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for pollen tube reception by the female gametophyte before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and the initiation of seed development after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the female gametophyte and in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the developing seeds was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old seedlings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in pollen or pollen tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in seeds. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in seeds, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of seed development. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization and supported the model that a passage through the female gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in seeds and controls early seed development.</p>

Processes Underlying a Reproductive Barrier in <i>indica</i>-<i>japonica</i> Rice Hybrids Revealed by Transcriptome Analysis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>In rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), hybrids between <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> subspecies are usually highly sterile, which provides a model system for studying post<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive isolation. A killer-protector system, <i>S5</i>, composed of three adjacent genes (<i>ORF3</i>, <i>ORF4</i>, and <i>ORF5</i>), regulates female gamete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity of <i>indica-japonica</i> hybrids. To characterize the processes underlying this system, we performed transcriptomic analyses of pistils from rice variety Balilla (BL), Balilla with transformed <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>5+</i>) producing sterile female gametes, and Balilla with transformed <i>ORF3+</i> and <i>ORF5+</i> (BL<i>3+5+</i>) producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>e gametes. RNA sequencing of tissues collected before (MMC), during (MEI), and after (AME) meiosis of the megaspore mother cell detected 19,269 to 20,928 genes as expressed. Comparison between BL<i>5+</i> and BL showed that <i>ORF5+</i> induced differential expression of 8,339, 6,278, and 530 genes at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. At MMC, large-scale differential expression of cell wall-modifying genes and biotic and abiotic response genes indicated that cell wall integrity damage induced severe biotic and abiotic stresses. The processes continued to MEI and induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as indicated by differential expression of ER stress-responsive genes, leading to programmed cell death at MEI and AME, resulting in abortive female gametes. In the BL<i>3+5+</i>/BL comparison, 3,986, 749, and 370 genes were differentially expressed at MMC, MEI, and AME, respectively. Large numbers of cell wall modification and biotic and abiotic response genes were also induced at MMC but largely suppressed at MEI without inducing ER stress and programed cell death , producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>e gametes. These results have general implications for the understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive barriers.</p>

Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C allocation to both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive and vegetative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in fruiting and non-fruiting trees for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion on C allocation to vegetative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting trees, fruiting reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting trees than non-fruiting trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of allocation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion affects C allocation to branches but not its source or storage. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Fish reproductive-energy output increases disproportionately with body size
<p>Body size determines total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive-energy output. Most theories assume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive output is a fixed proportion of size, with respect to mass, but formal macroecological tests are lacking. Management based on that assumption risks underestimating the contribution of larger mothers to replenishment, hindering sustainable harvesting. We test this assumption in marine fishes with a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of the intraspecific mass scaling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive-energy output. We show that larger mothers reproduce disproportionately more than smaller mothers in not only fecundity but also total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive energy. Our results reset much of the theory on how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion scales with size and suggest that larger mothers contribute disproportionately to population replenishment. Global change and overharvesting cause fish sizes to decline; our results provide quantitative estimates of how these declines affect fisheries and ecosystem-level productivity.</p>

<i>ESA1</i> Is Involved in Embryo Sac Abortion in Interspecific Hybrid Progeny of Rice
<p>The emergence of sterile individuals in the hybrid backcross progeny of wild and cultivated rice limits the use of wild rice alleles for improving cultivated rice, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this sterility remain unclear. Here, we identified the semisterile introgression line YIL42, derived from a cross between the <i>indica</i> rice variety Teqing (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Oryza rufipogon</i> accession YJCWR (Yuanjiang common wild rice), which exhibits semisterility. Using positional cloning, we isolated <i>EMBRYO SAC ABORTION 1</i> (<i>ESA1</i>), which encodes a nuclear-membrane localized protein containing an armadillo repeat domain. A mutation in <i>ESA1</i> at position 1819 (<sup>T</sup>1819<sup>C</sup>) converts a stop codon into an Arg (R) codon, causing delayed termination of protein translation. Analysis of transgenic lines indicated that the difference in ESA1 protein structure between <i>O. rufipogon</i>–derived <i>ESA1</i> and Teqing-derived <i>esa1</i> affects female gamete abortion during early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity investigation and expression analysis indicated that the interaction between <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> and unknown gene(s) of Teqing affects spikelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity of the hybrid backcross progeny. The <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> allele is present in <i>O. rufipogon</i> but absent in <i>O. sativa</i>, suggesting that variation in <i>ESA1</i> may be associated with interspecific hybrid incompatibility between wild and cultivated rice. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying female sterility, which is useful for improving the panicle seed setting rate of rice and for developing a strategy to overcome interspecific hybrid sterility between cultivated rice and wild rice.</p>

Asexual Female Gametogenesis Involves Contact with a Sexually-Fated Megaspore in Apomictic <i>Hieracium</i>
<p>Apomixis results in asexual seed formation where progeny are identical to the maternal plant. In ovules of apomictic species of the <i>Hieracium</i> subgenus <i>Pilosella</i>, meiosis of the megaspore mother cell generates four megaspores. Aposporous initial (AI) cells form during meiosis in most ovules. The sexual pathway terminates during functional megaspore (FM) differentiation, when an enlarged AI undergoes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s to form an aposporous female gametophyte. Then, the mitotically programmed FM dies along with the three other megaspores by unknown mechanisms. Transcriptomes of laser-dissected AIs, ovule cells, and ovaries from apomicts and AI-deficient mutants were analyzed to understand the pathways involved. The steps leading to AI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s and sexual pathway termination were determined using antibodies against arabinogalactan protein epitopes found to mark both sexual and aposporous female gametophyte lineages at inception. At most, four AIs differentiated near developing megaspores. The first expanding AI cell to contact the FM formed a functional AI that underwent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s soon after megaspore degeneration. Transcriptome analyses indicated that the enlarged, laser-captured AIs were arrested in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle and were metabolically active. Further comparisons with AI-deficient mutants showed that AIs were enriched in transcripts encoding homologs of genes involved in, and potentially antagonistic to, known FM specification pathways. We propose that AI and FM cell contact provides cues required for AI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s and megaspore degeneration. Specific candidates to further interrogate AI-FM interactions were identified here and include <i>Hieracium</i> arabinogalactan protein family genes.</p>

Triphosphate Tunnel Metalloenzyme Function in Senescence Highlights a Biological Diversification of This Protein Superfamily
<p>The triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme (TTM) superfamily comprises a group of enzymes that hydrolyze organophosphate substrates. They exist in all domains of life, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical role of most family members is unclear. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes three <i>TTM</i> genes. We have previously reported that AtTTM2 displays pyrophosphatase activity and is involved in pathogen resistance. Here, we report the biochemical activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function of <i>AtTTM1</i> and diversification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical roles between <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>2</i>. Biochemical analyses revealed that AtTTM1 displays pyrophosphatase activity similar to AtTTM2, making them the only TTMs characterized so far to act on a diphosphate substrate. However, knockout mutant analysis showed that <i>AtTTM1</i> is not involved in pathogen resistance but rather in leaf senescence. <i>AtTTM1</i> is transcriptionally up-regulated during leaf senescence, and knockout mutants of <i>AtTTM1</i> exhibit delayed dark-induced and natural senescence. The double mutant of <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>AtTTM2</i> did not show synergistic effects, further indicating the diversification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function. However, promoter swap analyses revealed that they functionally can complement each other, and confocal microscopy revealed that both proteins are tail-anchored proteins that localize to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Additionally, transient overexpression of either gene in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced senescence-like cell death upon dark treatment. Taken together, we show that two TTMs display the same biochemical properties but distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions that are governed by their transcriptional regulation. Moreover, this work reveals a possible connection of immunity-related programmed cell death and senescence through novel mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins.</p>

Increased homeothermy during reproduction in a basal placental mammal
<p>Homeothermic endothermy, the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) using heat produced by elevated metabolism, is energetically expensive. There is increasing evidence that the earliest endotherms were heterotherms that, rather than maintaining strict homeothermy, allowed <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> to fluctuate with large variations between active and rest-phase <i>T</i><sub>b</sub>. The high level of homeothermy observed in modern mammals is therefore likely to have evolved from an ancestral heterothermic state. One of the hypotheses for the evolution of endothermy is that homeothermy allows for greater energetic output during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion (parental care model). We tested this hypothesis by measuring metabolic rates over a range of ambient temperatures in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive and non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive greater hedgehog tenrecs (<i>Setifer setosus</i>), a physiologically primitive mammal from Madagascar. Tenrecs have some of the lowest metabolic rates and highest levels of <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability of any mammal and are therefore good models of the ancestral eutherian state. During pregnancy and lactation, there was an increase in metabolism and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> below the thermoneutral zone, accompanied by a decrease in <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> variability. The lower critical limit of the thermoneutral zone was estimated at ~25°C. However, whereas increases in resting metabolism were substantial below 20°C (up to 150% higher during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion), daytime rest-phase ambient temperatures at the study site rarely reached equivalent low levels. Thus, <i>S. setosus</i> provide an example for how relatively low-cost increases in homeothermy could have led to substantial increases in fitness by allowing for the faster production of young. The mechanisms necessary for increases in thermogenesis during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion would have further benefited the development of homeothermy in mammals.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

Sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling through its receptor S1P<sub>5</sub> promotes chromosome segregation and mitotic progression
<p>Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) promotes cell proliferation and survival, and its abundance is often increased in tumors. SphK1 produces the signaling lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which activates signaling cascades downstream five G protein–coupled receptors (S1P<sub>1–5</sub>) to modulate vascular and immune system function and promote proliferation. We identified a new function of the SphK1-S1P pathway specifically in the control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s. SphK1 depletion in HeLa cells caused prometaphase arrest, whereas its overexpression or activation accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s. Increasing the abundance of S1P promoted mitotic progression, overrode the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), and led to chromosome segregation defects. S1P was secreted through the transporter SPNS2 and stimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s by binding to and activating S1P<sub>5</sub> on the extracellular side, which then activated the intracellular phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT pathway. Knockdown of S1P<sub>5</sub> prevented the S1P-induced spindle defect phenotype. RNA interference assays revealed that the mitotic kinase Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) was an important effector of S1P-S1P<sub>5</sub> signaling-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s in HeLa cells. Our findings identify an extracellular signal and the downstream pathway that promotes mitotic progression and may indicate potential therapeutic targets to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems
<p>Mechanical power limitations emerge from the physical trade-off between force and velocity. Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems incorporate power-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small sizes. We establish how power enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own force-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical and synthetic systems. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. This analysis defines the cascading challenges of power enhancement, explores their emergent effects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical and engineered systems, and charts a pathway for higher-level analysis and synthesis of power-amplified systems.</p>

A mitosis-specific and R loop–driven ATR pathway promotes faithful chromosome segregation
<p>The ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase is crucial for DNA damage and replication stress responses. Here, we describe an unexpected role of ATR in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s. Acute inhibition or degradation of ATR in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s induces whole-chromosome missegregation. The effect of ATR ablation is not due to altered cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity, DNA damage responses, or unscheduled DNA synthesis but to loss of an ATR function at centromeres. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, ATR localizes to centromeres through Aurora A–regulated association with centromere protein F (CENP-F), allowing ATR to engage replication protein A (RPA)–coated centromeric R loops. As ATR is activated at centromeres, it stimulates Aurora B through Chk1, preventing formation of lagging chromosomes. Thus, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s-specific and R loop–driven ATR pathway acts at centromeres to promote faithful chromosome segregation, revealing functions of R loops and ATR in suppressing chromosome instability.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

SMALL AUXIN UP RNA62/75 Are Required for the Translation of Transcripts Essential for Pollen Tube Growth
<p>Successful pollen tube elongation is critical for double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions of pollen tube genes and the regulatory machinery underlying this crucial process are largely unknown. A previous translatomic study revealed two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAUR</i> (<i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i>) genes, <i>SAUR62</i> and <i>SAUR75</i>, whose expression is up-regulated by pollination. Here, we found that both SAUR62 and SAUR75 localized mainly to pollen tube nuclei. The siliques of homozygous <i>saur62</i> (<i>saur62/−</i>), <i>saur75</i> (<i>saur75/−</i>), and the <i>SAUR62</i>/<i>75</i> RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown line had many aborted seeds. These lines had normal pollen viability but defective in vitro and in vivo pollen tube growth, with branching phenotypes. Immunoprecipitation with transgenic SAUR62/75-GFP flowers revealed ribosomal protein RPL12 family members as potential interacting partners, and their individual interactions were confirmed further by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Polysome profiling showed reduced 80S ribosome abundance in homozygous <i>saur62</i>, <i>saur75</i>, <i>ribosomal large subunit12c</i>, and <i>SAUR62/75</i> RNAi flowers, suggesting that SAUR62/75 play roles in ribosome assembly. To clarify their roles in translation, we analyzed total proteins from RNAi versus wild-type flowers by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, revealing significantly reduced expression of factors participating in pollen tube wall biogenesis and F-actin dynamics, which are critical for the elastic properties of tube elongation. Indeed, RNAi pollen tubes showed mislocalization of deesterified and esterified pectins and F-actin organization. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical roles of SAUR62/75 and their RPL12 partners are critical in ribosomal pre-60S subunit assembly for efficient pollen tube elongation and subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization.</p>

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool, which enable the interpretation of an observed transcriptomic change (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional impact for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our perception of the functional impacts of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical significance of the observed DEGs using established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA. The PAIR version 5.0-inferred interactome and GSLA Web tool both can be accessed at <ext-link>http://public.synergylab.cn/pair/</ext-link>.</p>

Stage-Specific Gene Profiling of Germinal Cells Helps Delineate the Mitosis/Meiosis Transition
<p>In flowering plants, germ lines are induced from somatic meristems within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive organs. Within anthers, germinal cell initials first undergo several rounds of mitotic proliferation before synchronously entering meiosis. Our understanding of the progression and the molecular basis of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s to meiosis transition is still limited. Taking advantage of the correlation between anther length and premeiotic germinal cell development in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we studied the transcriptome dynamics of germinal cells at three sequential stages, mitotic archesporial cells, enlarging pollen mother cells at the premeiosis interphase, and pollen mother cells at the early prophase of meiosis, using laser microdissection-based expression profiling. Our analysis showed that cells undergoing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s-meiosis switch exhibit robust transcriptional changes. The three stages are distinguished by the expression of genes encoding transcription factor subsets, meiotic chromosome recombination proteins, and distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, respectively. The transcription level of genes encoding protein turnover machinery was significantly higher in these three stages of germinal cells than in mature pollen, parenchyma cells, or seedlings. Our experimental results further indicate that many meiotic genes are not only transcribed, but also translated prior to meiosis. We suggest that the enlarging pollen mother cells stage represents a crucial turning point from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s to meiosis for developing germinal cells.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Molecular Characterization and Evolution of a Gene Family Encoding Both Female- and Male-Specific Reproductive Proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same sex. To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive genes that become “co-opted” by males, we screened female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive genes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in males that is transferred to females during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated genes that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the female <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the male RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and gene expression analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy gene that was female-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved male-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each gene in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one female-expressed gene is essential for full fecundity, and both female-expressed genes contribute singly or in combination to a female’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the male-expressed paralog had no significant effect on female fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this gene family exert effects on females by acting on a common, female-expressed target. After duplication and male co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

Basal aurora kinase B activity is sufficient for histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase
<p>Histone H3 phosphorylation is the hallmark of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s deposited by aurora kinase B. Benzo[e]pyridoindoles are a family of potent, broad, ATP-competitive aurora kinase inhibitors. However, benzo[e]pyridoindole C4 only inhibits histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase but not in metaphase. Under the C4 treatment, the cells enter into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s with dephosphorylated histone H3, assemble chromosomes normally and progress to metaphase, and then to anaphase. C4 also induces lagging chromosome in anaphase but we demonstrated that these chromosome compaction defects are not related to the absence of H3 phosphorylation in prophase.

Our data suggest that aurora kinase B is progressively activated at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s entry and at anaphase onset.

Dual-spindle formation in zygotes keeps parental genomes apart in early mammalian embryos
<p>At the beginning of mammalian life, the genetic material from each parent meets when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ized egg divides. It was previously thought that a single microtubule spindle is responsible for spatially combining the two genomes and then segregating them to create the two-cell embryo. We used light-sheet microscopy to show that two bipolar spindles form in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>e and then independently congress the maternal and paternal genomes. These two spindles aligned their poles before anaphase but kept the parental genomes apart during the first cleavage. This spindle assembly mechanism provides a potential rationale for erroneous divisions into more than two blastomeric nuclei observed in mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">zygot</span></strong>es and reveals the mechanism behind the observation that parental genomes occupy separate nuclear compartments in the two-cell embryo.</p>

Bioinspired spring origami
<p>Origami enables folding of objects into a variety of shapes in arts, engineering, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. In contrast to well-known paper-folded objects, the wing of the earwig has an exquisite natural folding system that cannot be sufficiently described by current origami models. Such an unusual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system displays incompatible folding patterns, remains open by a bistable locking mechanism during flight, and self-folds rapidly without muscular actuation. We show that these notable functionalities arise from the protein-rich joints of the earwig wing, which work as extensional and rotational springs between facets. Inspired by this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical wing, we establish a spring origami model that broadens the folding design space of traditional origami and allows for the fabrication of precisely tunable, four-dimensional–printed objects with programmable bioinspired morphing functionalities.</p>

A new mitotic activity comes into focus
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s, each duplicated chromosome must be accurately attached to the microtubule spindle, which pulls the chromosomes to opposite poles of the cell, where they are segregated to daughter cells. A number of mitotic kinases orchestrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s to ensure accurate segregation, including cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), the Polo-like kinases, and the Aurora kinases (<i>1</i>). The kinase ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related), which is involved in DNA damage responses during interphase of the cell cycle, has also been shown to prevent chromosome segregation errors (<i>2</i>). However, this role of ATR was presumed to be an indirect effect. On page 108 of this issue, Kabeche <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) unveil a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s-specific ATR activity that ensures proper chromosome segregation and that this activity is dependent on a specific three-stranded nucleic acid structure known as an R loop.</p>

Cell cycle proteins moonlight in multiciliogenesis
<p>Multiciliated cells (MCCs) are a specialized population of postmitotic cells that are decorated with tens to hundreds of hairlike protrusions, termed motile cilia, that beat back and forth to direct fluid flow across an epithelium (<i>1</i>). MCCs line the respiratory tract, brain ventricles, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tracts of vertebrates and play a crucial role in tissue homeostasis; defects in the formation or movement of motile cilia can cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity defects, chronic respiratory infections, and/or a buildup of fluid in the brain. Despite their importance to human health, the pathways controlling the production of motile cilia in differentiating MCCs remain poorly understood. On page 803 of this issue, Al Jord <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) shed light on this question by showing that multiciliated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">progeni</span></strong>tor cells implement components of the mitotic cell cycle machinery to coordinate events that are required for motile ciliation and cellular differentiation, while avoiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell divis</span></strong>ion (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s).</p>

Elimination of the male reproductive tract in the female embryo is promoted by COUP-TFII in mice
<p>The sexual differentiation paradigm contends that the female pattern of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive system is established by default because the male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tracts (Wolffian ducts) in the female degenerate owing to a lack of androgen. Here, we discovered that female mouse embryos lacking <i>Coup-tfII</i> (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II) in the Wolffian duct mesenchyme became intersex—possessing both female and male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive tracts. Retention of Wolffian ducts was not caused by ectopic androgen production or action. Instead, enhanced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in Wolffian duct epithelium was responsible for the retention of male structures in an androgen-independent manner. We thus suggest that elimination of Wolffian ducts in female embryos is actively promoted by COUP-TFII, which suppresses a mesenchyme-epithelium cross-talk responsible for Wolffian duct maintenance.</p>

The ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 Complex Mediates Pollen Tube Growth by Coordinating Vacuolar Targeting and Organization
<p>Pollen tube growth is an essential step for successful plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion. Vacuolar trafficking and dynamic organization are important for pollen tube growth; however, the key proteins involved in these processes are not well understood. Here, we report that the ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 (AP-3) complex and its tonoplast cargo PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10) are critical for pollen tube growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). AP-3 is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of four subunits, δ, β, µ, and σ. AP-3 regulates tonoplast targeting of several cargoes, such as PAT10. We show that functional loss of any of the four AP-3 subunits reduces plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity. In <i>ap-3</i> mutants, pollen development was normal but pollen tube growth was compromised, leading to reduced male transmission. Functional loss of <i>PAT10</i> caused a similar reduction in pollen tube growth, suggesting that the tonoplast association of PAT10 mediated by AP-3 is crucial for this process. Indeed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient during pollen tube growth was reduced significantly due to <i>AP-3</i> loss of function, consistent with the abnormal targeting of CALCINUERIN B-LIKE2 (CBL2) and CBL3, whose tonoplast association depends on PAT10. Furthermore, we show that the pollen tubes of <i>ap-3</i> mutants have vacuoles with simplified tubules and bulbous structures, indicating that AP-3 affects vacuolar organization. Our results demonstrate a role for AP-3 in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion and provide insights into the role of vacuoles in polarized cell growth.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Transcription Factor MYB26 Is Key to Spatial Specificity in Anther Secondary Thickening Formation
<p>Successful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization relies on the production and effective release of viable pollen. Failure of anther opening (dehiscence), results in male sterility, although the pollen may be fully functional. MYB26 regulates the formation of secondary thickening in the anther endothecium, which is critical for anther dehiscence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity. Here, we show that although the <i>MYB26</i> transcript shows expression in multiple floral organs, the MYB26 protein is localized specifically to the anther endothecium nuclei and that it directly regulates two <i>NAC</i> domain genes, <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, which are critical for the induction of secondary thickening biosynthesis genes. However, there is a complex relationship of regulation between these genes and MYB26. Using DEX-inducible MYB26 lines and overexpression in the various mutant backgrounds, we have shown that MYB26 up-regulates both <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> expression. Surprisingly normal thickening and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity rescue does not occur in the absence of MYB26, even with constitutively induced <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i>, suggesting an additional essential role for MYB26 in this regulation. Combined overexpression of <i>NST1</i> and <i>NST2</i> in <i>myb26</i> facilitates limited ectopic thickening in the anther epidermis, but not in the endothecium, and thus fails to rescue dehiscence. Therefore, by a series of regulatory controls through MYB26, NST1, NST2, secondary thickening is formed specifically within the endothecium; this specificity is essential for anther opening.</p>

Multiplexed Gene Editing and Protein Overexpression Using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> Viral Vector
<p>Development of CRISPR/Cas9 transient gene editing screening tools in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y has been hindered by difficulty of delivering high quantities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ically active single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Furthermore, it has been largely accepted that in vivo generated sgRNAs need to be devoid of extraneous nucleotides, which has limited sgRNA expression by delivery vectors. Here, we increased cellular concentrations of sgRNA by transiently delivering sgRNAs using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-derived vector (TRBO) designed with 5′ and 3′ sgRNA proximal nucleotide-processing capabilities. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we used the TRBO-sgRNA delivery platform to target GFP in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (16c) plants, and gene editing was accompanied by loss of GFP expression. Surprisingly, indel (insertions and deletions) percentages averaged nearly 70% within 7 d postinoculation using the TRBO-sgRNA constructs, which retained 5′ nucleotide overhangs. In contrast, and in accordance with current models, in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays only edited DNA when 5′ sgRNA nucleotide overhangs were removed, suggesting a novel processing mechanism is occurring in planta. Since the Cas9/TRBO-sgRNA platform demonstrated sgRNA flexibility, we targeted the <i>N. benthamiana NbAGO1</i> paralogs with one sgRNA and also multiplexed two sgRNAs using a single TRBO construct, resulting in indels in three genes. TRBO-mediated expression of an RNA transcript consisting of an sgRNA adjoining a GFP protein coding region produced indels and viral-based GFP overexpression. In conclusion, multiplexed delivery of sgRNAs using the TRBO system offers flexibility for gene expression and editing and uncovered novel aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y.</p>

Similarities between Reproductive and Immune Pistil Transcriptomes of <i>Arabidopsis</i> Species
<p>Independent lines of evidence suggest that members from ancient and polymorphic gene families such as defensins and receptor-like kinases mediate intercellular communication during both the immune response and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion. Here, we report a large-scale analysis to investigate the extent of overlap between these processes by comparing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the pistil transcriptomes of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> during self-pollination and interspecific pollination and during infection with <i>Fusarium graminearum</i>. In both <i>Arabidopsis</i> species, the largest number of DEGs was identified in infected pistils, where genes encoding regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell divis</span></strong>ion and development were most frequently down-regulated. Comparison of DEGs between infection and various pollination conditions showed that up to 79% of down-regulated genes are shared between conditions and include especially defensin-like genes. Interspecific pollination of <i>A.</i> <i>thaliana</i> significantly up-regulated thionins and defensins. The significant overrepresentation of similar groups of DEGs in the transcriptomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive and immune responses of the pistil makes it a prime system in which to study the consequences of plant-pathogen interactions on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity and the evolution of intercellular communication in pollination.</p>

SDG2-Mediated H3K4me3 Is Crucial for Chromatin Condensation and Mitotic Division during Male Gametogenesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming occurring during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion is crucial for both animal and plant development. Histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mark of transcriptional active euchromatin. While much has been learned in somatic cells, H3K4me3 deposition and function in gametophyte is poorly studied. Here, we demonstrate that SET DOMAIN GROUP2 (SDG2)-mediated H3K4me3 deposition participates in epigenetic reprogramming during Arabidopsis male gametogenesis. We show that loss of SDG2 barely affects meiosis and cell fate establishment of haploid cells. However, we found that SDG2 is critical for postmeiotic microspore development. Mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cell divis</span></strong>ion progression is partly impaired in the loss-of-function <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant, particularly at the second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mitosi</span></strong>s setting up the two sperm cells. We demonstrate that SDG2 is involved in promoting chromatin decondensation in the pollen vegetative nucleus, likely through its role in H3K4me3 deposition, which prevents ectopic heterochromatic H3K9me2 speckle formation. Moreover, we found that derepression of the LTR retrotransposon <i>ATLANTYS1</i> is compromised in the vegetative cell of the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant pollen. Consistent with chromatin condensation and compromised transcription activity, pollen germination and pollen tube elongation, representing the key function of the vegetative cell in transporting sperm cells during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ization, are inhibited in the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant. Taken together, we conclude that SDG2-mediated H3K4me3 is an essential epigenetic mark of the gametophyte chromatin landscape, playing critical roles in gamete mitotic cell cycle progression and pollen vegetative cell function during male gametogenesis and beyond.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Small molecules are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in screens designed with a basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

The Genetic Control of Reproductive Development under High Ambient Temperature<xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Ambient temperature has a large impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive development and grain yield in temperate cereals. However, little is known about the genetic control of development under different ambient temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), high ambient temperatures accelerate or delay <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive development depending on the photoperiod response gene <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>Ppd-H1</i>) and its upstream regulator <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>HvELF3</i>). A natural mutation in <i>Ppd-H1</i> prevalent in spring barley delayed floral development and reduced the number of florets and seeds per spike, while the wild-type <i>Ppd-H1</i> or a mutant <i>Hvelf3</i> allele accelerated floral development and maintained the seed number under high ambient temperatures. High ambient temperature delayed the expression phase and reduced the amplitude of clock genes and repressed the floral integrator gene <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> independently of the genotype. <i>Ppd-H1</i>-dependent variation in flowering time under different ambient temperatures correlated with relative expression levels of the <i>BARLEY MADS</i>-box genes <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>HvVRN1</i>), <i>HvBM3</i>, and <i>HvBM8</i> in the leaf. Finally, we show that <i>Ppd-H1</i> interacts with regulatory variation at <i>HvVRN1. Ppd-H1</i> only accelerated floral development in the background of a spring <i>HvVRN1</i> allele with a deletion in the regulatory intron. The full-length winter <i>Hvvrn1</i> allele was strongly down-regulated, and flowering was delayed by high temperatures irrespective of <i>Ppd-H1</i>. Our findings demonstrate that the photoperiodic and vernalization pathways interact to control flowering time and floret <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fertil</span></strong>ity in response to ambient temperature in barley.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reproduct</span></strong>ion remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen development.</p>

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral suppressors of RNA silencing induce developmental defects similar to those caused by mutations in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral suppressor-mediated developmental defects to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental defects in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral suppressors were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> mutation. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral suppressor-mediated developmental defects, using two independent <i>arf8</i> mutations and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral suppressor of silencing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F1 generation, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the phenotype in the F2 generation. However, the loss of phenotype in the F2 generation was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent loss-of-function point mutation, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 generations. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental defects caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

Intra-operative acetabular component position   was determined according to the pre-operative spinal mobility. Sagittal   implant measurements of ante-inclination and sacral acetabular angle were   used as surrogate measurements for the risk of impingement, and   intra-operative acetabular component angles were compared with these.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Post-operatively, ante-inclination and sacral acetabular angles   were within normal range in 133 hips (83.1%). A total of seven hips   (4.4%) had pathological imbalance and were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ically or surgically   fused hips. In all, 23 of 24 hips had pre-operative dangerous spinal   imbalance corrected.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In all, 145 of 160 hips (90%) were considered safe from impingement.   Patients with highest risk are those with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical or surgical   spinal fusion; patients with dangerous spinal imbalance can be safe   with correct acetabular component position. The clinical relevance   of the study is that it correlates acetabular component position   to spinal pelvic mobility which provides guidelines for total hip   arthroplasty.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(1   Supple A):37–45.</p></sec>

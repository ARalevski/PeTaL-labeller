The functional role of caudal and anal/dorsal fins during the C-start of a bluegill sunfish
<p>Fast starts are crucial in the survival of aquatic swimmers to capture prey or avoid predators. Currently, it is widely accepted that during C-starts: (1) the caudal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong> generates a considerable hydrodynamic force; and (2) anal/dorsal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>s are erected to significantly increase the hydrodynamic force. In this work, the above hypotheses on the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>s during C-starts are studied using expe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rim</span></strong>entally guided numerical simulations of four bluegill sunfish, whose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>s are removed or erected. The amount of force created by the body and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>s at each time instant was not constant and varied during the C-start. Nevertheless, in agreement with hypothesis (1), up to 70% of the instantaneous hydrodynamic force was generated by the tail during Stage 2 of the C-start, when the sunfish rapidly bends out of the C-shape. Additionally, the contribution in Stage 1, when the sunfish bends into a C-shape, is less than 20% at each instant. Most of the force in Stage 1 was produced by the body of the sunfish. In contrast to hypothesis (2), the effect of erection/removal of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>s was less than 5% of the instantaneous force in both Stages 1 and 2, except for a short period of time (2 ms) just before Stage 2. However, it is known that the anal/dorsal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>s are actively controlled during the C-start from muscle activity measurements. Based on the results presented here, it is suggested that the active control of the anal/dorsal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>s can be related to retaining the stability of the sunfish against roll and pitch movements during the C-start. Furthermore, the erection of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>s increases the moment of inertia to make the roll and pitch movements more difficult.</p>

Mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate in response to traumatic bone injury in the zebrafish fin and skull
<p>Zebrafish have an unlimited capacity to regenerate bone after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong> amputation. In this process, mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate to osteogenic precursor cells and thus represent an important source of newly forming bone. By contrast, differentiated osteoblasts do not appear to contribute to repair of bone injuries in mammals; rather, osteoblasts form anew from mesenchymal stem cells. This raises the question whether osteoblast dedifferentiation is specific to appendage regeneration, a special feature of the lepidotrichia bone of the fish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>, or a process found more generally in fish bone. Here, we show that dedifferentiation of mature osteoblasts is not restricted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong> regeneration after amputation, but also occurs during repair of zebrafish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong> fractures and skull injuries. In both models, mature osteoblasts surrounding the injury downregulate the expression of differentiation markers, upregulate markers of the pre-osteoblast state and become proliferative. Making use of photoconvertible Kaede protein as well as Cre-driven genetic fate mapping, we show that osteoblasts migrate to the site of injury to replace damaged tissue. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>dings suggest a fundamental role for osteoblast dedifferentiation in reparative bone formation in fish and indicate that adult fish osteoblasts display elevated cellular plasticity compared with mammalian bone-forming cells.</p>

Is it safe to preserve the deltoid when resecting the proximal humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Resection of the proximal humerus for the p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rim</span></strong>ary malignant bone   tumour sometimes requires <i>en bloc</i> resection of the   deltoid. However, there is no information in the literature which   helps a surgeon decide whether to preserve the deltoid or not. The   aim of this study was to determine whether retaining the deltoid   at the time of resection would increase the rate of local recurrence.   We also sought to identify the variables that persuade expert surgeons   to choose a deltoid sparing rather than deltoid resecting procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 45 patients who had undergone resection of a p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rim</span></strong>ary   malignant tumour of the proximal humerus. There were 29 in the deltoid   sparing group and 16 in the deltoid resecting group. Imaging studies   were reviewed to assess tumour extension and soft-tissue involvement.   The presence of a fat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rim</span></strong> separating the tumour from the deltoid   on MRI was particularly noted. The cumulative probability of local   recurrence was calculated in a competing risk scenario.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference (adjusted p = 0.89) in the   cumulative probability of local recurrence between the deltoid sparing   (7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 to 20) and the deltoid resecting   group (26%, 95% CI 8 to 50). Patients were more likely to be selected   for a deltoid sparing procedure if they presented with a small tumour   (p = 0.0064) with less bone involvement (p = 0.032) and a continuous   fat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rim</span></strong> on MRI (p = 0.002) and if the axillary nerve could be identified   (p = 0.037).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A deltoid sparing procedure can provide good local control after   resection of the proximal humerus for a p<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rim</span></strong>ary malignant bone tumour.

Transcriptional activation of elephant shark mineralocorticoid receptor by corticosteroids, progesterone, and spironolactone
<p>The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is a nuclear receptor and part of a large and diverse family of transcription factors that also includes receptors for glucocorticoids, progesterone, androgens, and estrogens. The corticosteroid aldosterone is the physiological activator of the MR in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates; however, its activator is not known in cartilaginous fish, the oldest group of extant jawed vertebrates. Here, we analyzed the ability of corticosteroids and progesterone to activate the full-length MR from the elephant shark (<i>Callorhinchus milii</i>). On the basis of their measured activities, aldosterone, cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxcortisol, progesterone, and 19-norprogesterone are potential physiological mineralocorticoids. However, aldosterone, the physiological mineralocorticoid in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates, is not found in cartilaginous or ray-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>ned fish. Although progesterone activates MRs in ray-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>ned fish, progesterone does not activate MRs in humans, amphibians, or alligator, suggesting that during the transition to terrestrial vertebrates, progesterone lost the ability to activate the MR. Both elephant shark MR and human MR are expressed in the brain, heart, ovary, testis, and other nonepithelial tissues, suggesting that MR expression in diverse tissues evolved in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. Our data suggest that 19-norprogesterone– and progesterone-activated MR may have unappreciated functions in reproductive physiology.</p>

Hydraulic control of tuna fins: A role for the lymphatic system in vertebrate locomotion
<p>The lymphatic system in teleost fish has genetic and developmental origins similar to those of the mammalian lymphatic system, which is involved in immune response and fluid homeostasis. Here, we show that the lymphatic system of tunas functions in swimming hydrodynamics. Specifically, a musculo-vascular complex, consisting of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong> muscles, bones, and lymphatic vessels, is involved in the hydraulic control of median <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>s. This specialization of the lymphatic system is associated with fish in the family Scombridae and may have evolved in response to the demand for swimming and maneuvering control in these high-performance species.</p>

Regulated proteolysis of p62/SQSTM1 enables differential control of autophagy and nutrient sensing
<p>The multidomain scaffold protein p62 (also called sequestosome-1) is involved in autophagy, antimicrobial immunity, and oncogenesis. Mutations in <i>SQSTM1</i>, which encodes p62, are linked to hereditary inflammatory conditions such as Paget’s disease of the bone, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and distal myopathy with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rim</span></strong>med vacuoles. Here, we report that p62 was proteolytically t<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rim</span></strong>med by the protease caspase-8 into a stable protein, which we called p62<sup>TRM</sup>. We found that p62<sup>TRM</sup>, but not full-length p62, was involved in nutrient sensing and homeostasis through the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). The kinase RIPK1 and caspase-8 controlled p62<sup>TRM</sup> production and thus promoted mTORC1 signaling. An FTD-linked p62 D329G polymorphism and a rare D329H variant could not be proteolyzed by caspase-8, and these noncleavable variants failed to activate mTORC1, thereby revealing the det<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rim</span></strong>ental effect of these mutations. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>dings on the role of p62<sup>TRM</sup> provide new insights into <i>SQSTM1</i>-linked diseases and mTORC1 signaling.</p>

A key metabolic gene for recurrent freshwater colonization and radiation in fishes
<p>Colonization of new ecological niches has triggered large adaptive radiations. Although some lineages have made use of such opportunities, not all do so. The factors causing this variation among lineages are largely unknown. Here, we show that deficiency in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential ω-3 fatty acid, can constrain freshwater colonization by marine fishes. Our genomic analyses revealed multiple independent duplications of the fatty acid desaturase gene <i>Fads2</i> in stickleback lineages that subsequently colonized and radiated in freshwater habitats, but not in close relatives that failed to colonize. Transgenic manipulation of <i>Fads2</i> in marine stickleback increased their ability to synthesize DHA and survive on DHA-deficient diets. Multiple freshwater ray-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>ned fishes also show a convergent increase in <i>Fads2</i> copies, indicating its key role in freshwater colonization.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it expe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rim</span></strong>entally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong>ned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the mechanism of generating water motion by mouth suction.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A contact patch to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rim</span></strong> (CPR) distance of < 10 mm has been   associated with edge-loading and excessive wear. However, not all   arthroplasties with a low CPR distance show problems with wear.   Therefore, CPR distance may not be the only variable affecting the   post-operative metal ion concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used multiple logistic regression to determine what variables   differed between the patients who had high and low cobalt (CoS)   and chromium (CrS) serum ion concentrations within a cohort of patients   with low (< 10 mm) CPR distances. A total of 56 patients treated   with unilateral hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) had CoS and CrS   ion studies performed more than one year after surgery. The mean   age of the patients at the time of surgery was 51.7 years (29 to   70), with 38 women (68%) and 18 men (32%).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>It was seen that 47 patients had low ion levels (< 7µg/L)   and nine had high ion levels (≥ 7µg/L). We found increased risks   of high wear with decreasing CPR distance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of CPR distance measurements to predict hips at risk   for elevated wear is needed for all patients with HRA. We recommend   that patients with low CPR distances have at least one serum ion   study performed while patients with CPR distance > 10 mm do not   need routine ion studies. We believe that patients with low CPR   distance and low ions do not need repeat ion studies unless the   patient becomes symptomatic or has substantial radiographic changes.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:865–71.</p></sec>

Restoration of the centre of rotation in primary total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>One goal of total hip arthroplasty is to restore normal hip anatomy.   The aim of this study was to compare displacement of the centre   of rotation (COR) using a standard reaming technique with a technique   in which the acetabulum was reamed immediately peripherally and   referenced off the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rim</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In the first cohort the acetabulum was reamed to the floor followed   by sequentially larger reamers. In the second cohort the acetabulum   was only reamed peripherally, starting with a reamer the same size   as the native femoral head. Anteroposterior pelvic radiographs were   analysed for acetabular floor depth and vertical and horizontal position   of the COR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Horizontally, the mean medial displacement of the COR was 0.8   mm (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 1.4) in the peripheral remaing   group and 5.0 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 3.30) in the standard reaming group   (p < 0.001). Vertically, the mean superior displacement of the   COR was 0.7 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 1.3) in the peripheral reaming group   and 3.7 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 2.6) in the standard reaming group (p < 0.001).   In the standard reaming group, there was a strong correlation between   the pre-operative acetabular floor depth and displacement of the   COR (p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Reaming the acetabulum to the floor can lead to significant displacement   of the COR medially and superiorly. This displacement is related   to the pre-operative acetabular floor depth and cannot always be   compensated by using a high offset stem.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1597–603.</p></sec>

The development of zebrafish tendon and ligament progenitors
<p>Despite the importance of tendons and ligaments for transmitting movement and providing stability to the musculoskeletal system, their development is considerably less well understood than that of the tissues they serve to connect. Zebrafish have been widely used to address questions in muscle and skeletal development, yet few studies describe their tendon and ligament tissues. We have analyzed in zebrafish the expression of several genes known to be enriched in mammalian tendons and ligaments, including <i>scleraxis</i> (<i>scx</i>), <i>collagen 1a2</i> (<i>col1a2</i>) and <i>tenomodulin</i> (<i>tnmd</i>), or in the tendon-like myosepta of the zebrafish (<i>xirp2a</i>). Co-expression studies with muscle and cartilage markers demonstrate the presence of <i>scxa</i>, <i>col1a2</i> and <i>tnmd</i> at sites between the developing muscle and cartilage, and <i>xirp2a</i> at the myotendinous junctions. We determined that the zebrafish craniofacial tendon and ligament progenitors are neural crest derived, as in mammals. Cranial and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fin</span></strong> tendon progenitors can be induced in the absence of differentiated muscle or cartilage, although neighboring muscle and cartilage are required for tendon cell maintenance and organization, respectively. By contrast, myoseptal <i>scxa</i> expression requires muscle for its initiation. Together, these data suggest a conserved role for muscle in tendon development. Based on the similarities in gene expression, morphology, collagen ultrastructural arrangement and developmental regulation with that of mammalian tendons, we conclude that the zebrafish tendon populations are homologous to their force-transmitting counterparts in higher vertebrates. Within this context, the zebrafish model can be used to provide new avenues for studying tendon biology in a vertebrate genetic system.</p>

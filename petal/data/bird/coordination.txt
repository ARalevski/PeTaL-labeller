Resolving Ambiguity of Species Limits and Concatenation in Multilocus Sequence Data for the Construction of Phylogenetic Supermatrices
<p>Public DNA databases are becoming too large and too complex for manual methods to generate phylogenetic supermatrices from multiple gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. Delineating the terminals based on taxonomic labels is no longer practical because species identifications are frequently incomplete and gene trees are incongruent with Linnaean binomials, which results in uncertainty about how to combine species units among unlinked loci. We developed a procedure that minimizes the problem of forming multilocus species units in a large phylogenetic data set using algorithms from graph theory. An initial step established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e clusters for each locus that broadly correspond to the species level. These clusters frequently include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es labeled with various binomials and specimen identifiers that create multiple alternatives for concatenation. To choose among these possibilities, we minimize taxonomic conflict among the species units globally in the data set using a multipartite heuristic algorithm. The procedure was applied to all available GenBank data for Coleoptera (beetles) including > 10 500 taxon labels and > 23 500 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es of 4 loci, which were grouped into 11 241 clusters or divergent singletons by the BlastClust software. Within each cluster, unidentified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es could be assigned to a species name through the association with fully identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, resulting in 510 new identifications (13.9% of total unidentified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es) of which nearly half were “trans-locus” identifications by clustering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es at a secondary locus. The limits of DNA-based clusters were inconsistent with the Linnaean binomials for 1518 clusters (13.5%) that contained more than one binomial or split a single binomial among multiple clusters. By applying a scoring scheme for full and partial name matches in pairs of clusters, a maximum weight set of 7366 global species units was produced. Varying the match weights for partial matches had little effect on the number of units, although if partial matches were disallowed, the number increased greatly. Trees from the resulting supermatrices generally produced tree topologies in good agreement with the higher taxonomy of Coleoptera, with fewer terminals compared with trees generated according to standard filtering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es using species labels. The study illustrates a strategy for assembling the tree-of-life from an ever more complex primary database.

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es and downloading those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from <ext-link>www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>.</p>

Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The metal-insulator transition in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated materials is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition. This coupling not only complicates the understanding of the basic mechanism of this phenomenon but also limits the speed and endurance of prospective electronic devices. We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven metal-insulator transition in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated material, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e interaction suppresses the electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations without changing the crystal structure in this otherwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated insulator. This interaction stabilizes a nonequilibrium metallic phase and leads to an isostructural metal-insulator transition. This discovery will provide insights into phase transitions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated materials and may aid the design of device functionalities.</p>

Learning and attention reveal a general relationship between population activity and behavior
<p>Prior studies have demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability changes with cognitive processes that improve perceptual performance. We tested whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability covaries with subjects’ performance—whether performance improves quickly with attention or slowly with perceptual learning. We found a single, consistent relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability and behavioral performance, regardless of the time frame of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability change. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability was oriented along the dimensions in population space used by the animal on a trial-by-trial basis to make decisions. That subjects’ choices were predicted by specific dimensions that were aligned with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability axis clarifies long-standing paradoxes about the relationship between shared variability and behavior.</p>

Kilogram-scale prexasertib monolactate monohydrate synthesis under continuous-flow CGMP conditions
<p>Advances in drug potency and tailored therapeutics are promoting pharmaceutical manufacturing to transition from a traditional batch paradigm to more flexible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous processing. Here we report the development of a multistep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous-flow CGMP (current good manufacturing practices) process that produced 24 kilograms of prexasertib monolactate monohydrate suitable for use in human clinical trials. Eight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous unit operations were conducted to produce the target at roughly 3 kilograms per day using small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous reactors, extractors, evaporators, crystallizers, and filters in laboratory fume hoods. Success was enabled by advances in chemistry, engineering, analytical science, process modeling, and equipment design. Substantial technical and business drivers were identified, which merited the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous process. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous process afforded improved performance and safety relative to batch processes and also improved containment of a highly potent compound.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p>Oil palm is the world’s leading source of vegetable oil and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of oil palm. The genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e of <i>Pisifera</i> is available whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed yet. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the oil palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing of 17 additional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high genetic variation among palms from different geographical regions, but lower variation among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We mapped 10,000 SNPs on the linkage map of oil palm. In addition, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the oil palms used in breeding populations of Southeast Asia, suggesting that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this important oil crop. Our data provide a valuable resource for accelerating genetic improvement and studying the mechanism underlying phenotypic variations of important oil palm traits.</p>

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research would <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, genetics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the forest sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the availability of genetic and genomic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing will <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>e to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Geometric Morphometric Character Suites as Phylogenetic Data: Extracting Phylogenetic Signal from Gastropod Shells
<p>Despite being the objects of numerous macroevolutionary studies, many of the best represented constituents of the fossil record—including diverse examples such as foraminifera, brachiopods, and mollusks—have mineralized skeletons with limited discrete characteristics, making morphological phylogenies difficult to construct. In contrast to their paucity of phylogenetic characters, the mineralized structures (tests and shells) of these fossil groups frequently have distinctive shapes that have long proved useful for their classification. The recent introduction of methodologies for including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous data directly in a phylogenetic analysis has increased the number of available characters, making it possible to produce phylogenies based, in whole or part, on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous character data collected from such taxa. Geometric morphometric methods provide tools for accurately characterizing shape variation and can produce quantitative data that can therefore now be included in a phylogenetic matrix in a nonarbitrary manner. Here, the marine gastropod genus <i>Conus</i> is used to evaluate the ability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous characters—generated from a geometric morphometric analysis of shell shape—to contribute to a total evidence phylogenetic hypothesis constructed using molecular and morphological data. Furthermore, the ability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous characters derived from geometric morphometric analyses to place fossil taxa with limited discrete characters into a phylogeny with their extant relatives was tested by simulating the inclusion of fossil taxa. This was done by removing the molecular partition of individual extant species to produce a “cladistic pseudofossil” with only the geometric morphometric derived characters coded. The phylogenetic position of each cladistic pseudofossil taxon was then compared with its placement in the total evidence tree and a symmetric resampling tree to evaluate the degree to which morphometric characters alone can correctly place simulated fossil species. In 33–45% of the test cases (depending upon the approach used for measuring success), it was possible to place the pseudofossil taxon into the correct regions of the phylogeny using only the morphometric characters. This suggests that the incorporation of extinct <i>Conus</i> taxa into phylogenetic hypotheses will be possible, permitting a wide range of macroevolutionary questions to be addressed within this genus. This methodology also has potential to contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions for other major components of the fossil record that lack numerous discrete characters.

Correlations in high-harmonic generation of matter-wave jets revealed by pattern recognition
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations in interacting many-body systems are key to the study of quantum matter. The complexity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations typically grows quickly as the system evolves and thus presents a challenge for experimental characterization and intuitive understanding. In a strongly driven Bose-Einstein condensate, we observe the high-harmonic generation of matter-wave jets with complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations as a result of bosonic stimulation. Based on a pattern recognition scheme, we identify a pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations that reveals the underlying secondary scattering processes and higher-order <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations.

Gcorn Plant: A Database for Retrieving Functional and Evolutionary Traits of Plant Genes
<p>Gene homology helps us understand gene function and speciation. The number of plant genes and species registered in public databanks is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ously increasing. It is useful to associate homologous genes of various plants to better understand plant speciation. We designed the Gcorn plant database for the retrieval of information on homology and evolution of a plant gene of interest. Amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es of 73 species (62 land plants and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, homologous genes were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a gene of interest, a phylogenetic tree, connecting genes with high homology indices, and line charts of the numbers of genes with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous genes, and on a phylogenetic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. Gcorn plant provides information on homologous genes at various virtual time points along with speciation in plants.</p>

DDM1 Represses Noncoding RNA Expression and RNA-Directed DNA Methylation in Heterochromatin
<p>C methylation of DNA, which occurs at CG, CHG, and CHH (H = A, C, or T) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es in plants, is a hallmark for the epigenetic repression of repetitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. The chromatin-remodeling factor DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION1 (DDM1) is essential for DNA methylation, especially at CG and CHG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. However, its potential roles in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and in chromatin function are not completely understood in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). In this work, we used high-throughput approaches to study the function of rice DDM1 (OsDDM1) in RdDM and the expression of noncoding RNA. We show that loss of function of OsDDM1 results in ectopic CHH methylation of transposable elements and repeats. The ectopic CHH methylation was dependent on rice DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE2, a DNA methyltransferase involved in RdDM. Mutations in <i>OsDDM1</i> lead to decreases of histone H3K9me2 and increases in the levels of heterochromatic small RNA and long noncoding RNA. In particular, OsDDM1 was found to be essential to repress the transcription of the two repetitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, Centromeric Retrotransposons of Rice1 and the dominant centromeric CentO repeats. These results suggest that OsDDM1 antagonizes RdDM at heterochromatin and represses the tissue-specific expression of noncoding RNA from repetitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es in the rice genome.</p>

Structure-Function Analysis of Chloroplast Proteins via Random Mutagenesis Using Error-Prone PCR
<p>Site-directed mutagenesis of chloroplast genes was developed three decades ago and has greatly advanced the field of photosynthesis research. Here, we describe a new approach for generating random chloroplast gene mutants that combines error-prone polymerase chain reaction of a gene of interest with chloroplast complementation of the knockout <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> mutant. As a proof of concept, we targeted a 300-bp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e of the <i>petD</i> gene that encodes subunit IV of the thylakoid membrane-bound cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing chloroplast transformants, we revealed 149 mutations in the 300-bp target <i>petD</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e that resulted in 92 amino acid substitutions in the 100-residue target subunit IV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e. Our results show that this method is suited to the study of highly hydrophobic, multisubunit, and chloroplast-encoded proteins containing cofactors such as hemes, iron-sulfur clusters, and chlorophyll pigments. Moreover, we show that mutant screening and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing can be used to study photosynthetic mechanisms or to probe the mutational robustness of chloroplast-encoded proteins, and we propose that this method is a valuable tool for the directed evolution of enzymes in the chloroplast.</p>

Impaired Cyclic Electron Flow around Photosystem I Disturbs High-Light Respiratory Metabolism
<p>The cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (CEF-PSI) increases ATP/NADPH production in the chloroplast, acting as an energy balance mechanism. Higher export of reducing power from the chloroplast in CEF-PSI mutants has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with higher mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and protein amount under high-light (HL) conditions. However, in vivo measurements of AOX activity are still required to confirm the exact role of AOX in dissipating the excess of reductant power from the chloroplast. Here, CEF-PSI single and double mutants were exposed to short-term HL conditions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Chlorophyll fluorescence, in vivo activities of the cytochrome oxidase (ν<sub>cyt</sub>) and AOX (ν<sub>alt</sub>) pathways, levels of mitochondrial proteins, metabolite profiles, and pyridine nucleotide levels were determined under normal growth and HL conditions. ν<sub>alt</sub> was not increased in CEF-PSI mutants, while AOX capacity was positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with photoinhibition, probably due to a reactive oxygen species-induced increase of AOX protein. The severe metabolic impairment observed in CEF-PSI mutants, as indicated by the increase in photoinhibition and changes in the levels of stress-related metabolites, can explain their lack of ν<sub>alt</sub> induction. By contrast, ν<sub>cyt</sub> was positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with photosynthetic performance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations with metabolite changes suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> is coordinated with sugar metabolism and stress-related amino acid synthesis. Furthermore, changes in glycine-serine and NADH-NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios were highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated to ν<sub>cyt</sub>. Taken together, our results suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> can act as a sink for the excess of electrons from the chloroplast, probably via photorespiratory glycine oxidation, thus improving photosynthetic performance when ν<sub>alt</sub> is not induced under severe HL stress.</p>

Fine-Tuning Motile Cilia and Flagella: Evolution of the Dynein Motor Proteins from Plants to Humans at High Resolution
<p>The flagellum is a key innovation linked to eukaryogenesis. It provides motility by regulated cycles of bending and bend propagation, which are thought to be controlled by a complex arrangement of seven distinct dyneins in repeated patterns of outer- (OAD) and inner-arm dynein (IAD) complexes. Electron tomography showed high similarity of this axonemal repeat pattern across ciliates, algae, and animals, but the diversity of dynein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es across the eukaryotes has not yet comprehensively been resolved and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with structural data. To shed light on the evolution of the axoneme I performed an exhaustive analysis of dyneins using the available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed genome data. Evidence from motor domain phylogeny allowed expanding the current set of nine dynein subtypes by eight additional isoforms with, however, restricted taxonomic distributions. I confirmed the presence of the nine dyneins in all eukaryotic super-groups indicating their origin predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor. The comparison of the N-terminal tail domains revealed a most likely axonemal dynein origin of the new classes, a group of chimeric dyneins in plants/algae and Stramenopiles, and the unique domain architecture and origin of the outermost OADs present in green algae and ciliates but not animals. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e and structural data suggests the single-headed class-8 and class-9 dyneins to localize to the distal end of the axonemal repeat and the class-7 dyneins filling the region up to the proximal heterodimeric IAD. Tracing dynein gene duplications across the eukaryotes indicated ongoing diversification and fine-tuning of flagellar functions in extant taxa and species.</p>

Hierarchical and Spatially Explicit Clustering of DNA Sequences with BAPS Software
<p>Phylogeographical analyses have become commonplace for a myriad of organisms with the advent of cheap DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing technologies. Bayesian model-based clustering is a powerful tool for detecting important patterns in such data and can be used to decipher even quite subtle signals of systematic differences in molecular variation. Here, we introduce two upgrades to the Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure (BAPS) software, which enable 1) spatially explicit modeling of variation in DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es and 2) hierarchical clustering of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e data to reveal nested genetic population structures.

The usefulness of hierarchical clustering is demonstrated through an analysis of the metapopulation structure within a bacterial population experiencing a high level of local horizontal gene transfer.

Gene Capture Coupled to High-Throughput Sequencing as a Strategy for Targeted Metagenome Exploration

To reduce the environmental complexity, we created an innovative solution hybrid selection (SHS) method that is combined with NGS to characterize large DNA fragments harbouring biomarkers of interest. The quality of enrichment was evaluated after fragments containing the methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A gene (<i>mcrA</i>), the biomarker of methanogenesis, were captured from a <i>Methanosarcina</i> strain and a metagenomic sample from a meromictic lake. The methanogen diversity was compared with direct metagenome and <i>mcrA</i>-based amplicon pyro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing strategies<i>.</i> The SHS approach resulted in the capture of DNA fragments up to 2.5 kb with an enrichment efficiency between 41 and 100%, depending on the sample complexity. Compared with direct metagenome and amplicons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing, SHS detected broader <i>mcrA</i> diversity, and it allowed efficient sampling of the rare biosphere and unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. In contrast to amplicon-based strategies, SHS is less biased and GC independent, and it recovered complete biomarker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es in addition to conserved regions. Because this method can also isolate the regions flanking the target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, it could facilitate operon reconstructions.</p>

Targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas system in medaka
<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system-based RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN) has recently emerged as a simple and efficient tool for targeted genome editing. In this study, we showed successful targeted mutagenesis using RGENs in medaka, <i>Oryzias latipes</i>. Somatic and heritable mutations were induced with high efficiency at the targeted genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e on the <i>DJ-1</i> gene in embryos that had been injected with the single guide RNA (sgRNA) transcribed by a T7 promoter and capped RNA encoding a Cas9 nuclease. The sgRNAs that were designed for the target genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es without the 5′ end of GG required by the T7 promoter induced the targeted mutations. This suggests that the RGEN can target any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e adjacent to an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e, which occurs once every 8 bp. The off-target alterations at 2 genomic loci harboring double mismatches in the 18-bp targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es were induced in the RGEN-injected embryos. However, we also found that the off-target effects could be reduced by lower dosages of sgRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that CRISPR/Cas-mediated RGENs may be an efficient and flexible tool for genome editing in medaka.</p>

Tracing the origin and evolution of pseudokinases across the tree of life
<p>Protein phosphorylation by eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) is a fundamental mechanism of cell signaling in all organisms. In model vertebrates, ~10% of ePKs are classified as pseudokinases, which have amino acid changes within the catalytic machinery of the kinase domain that distinguish them from their canonical kinase counterparts. However, pseudokinases still regulate various signaling pathways, usually doing so in the absence of their own catalytic output. To investigate the prevalence, evolutionary relationships, and biological diversity of these pseudoenzymes, we performed a comprehensive analysis of putative pseudokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es in available eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal proteomes. We found that pseudokinases are present across all domains of life, and we classified nearly 30,000 eukaryotic, 1500 bacterial, and 20 archaeal pseudokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es into 86 pseudokinase families, including ~30 families that were previously unknown. We uncovered a rich variety of pseudokinases with notable expansions not only in animals but also in plants, fungi, and bacteria, where pseudokinases have previously received cursory attention. These expansions are accompanied by domain shuffling, which suggests roles for pseudokinases in plant innate immunity, plant-fungal interactions, and bacterial signaling. Mechanistically, the ancestral kinase fold has diverged in many distinct ways through the enrichment of unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e motifs to generate new families of pseudokinases in which the kinase domain is repurposed for noncanonical nucleotide binding or to stabilize unique, inactive kinase conformations. We further provide a collection of annotated pseudokinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es in the Protein Kinase Ontology (ProKinO) as a new mineable resource for the signaling community.</p>

Tuning superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene
<p>Materials with flat electronic bands often exhibit exotic quantum phenomena owing to strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations. An isolated low-energy flat band can be induced in bilayer graphene by simply rotating the layers by 1.1°, resulting in the appearance of gate-tunable superconducting and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated insulating phases. In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to the twist angle, the interlayer coupling can be varied to precisely tune these phases. We induce superconductivity at a twist angle larger than 1.1°—in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated phases are otherwise absent—by varying the interlayer spacing with hydrostatic pressure. Our low-disorder devices reveal details about the superconducting phase diagram and its relationship to the nearby insulator. Our results demonstrate twisted bilayer graphene to be a distinctively tunable platform for exploring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated states.</p>

Single-cell multiomics sequencing and analyses of human colorectal cancer

Structure of a prehandover mammalian ribosomal SRP·SRP receptor targeting complex
<p>Signal recognition particle (SRP) targets proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). SRP recognizes the ribosome synthesizing a signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e and delivers it to the SRP receptor (SR) on the ER membrane followed by the transfer of the signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e to the translocon.

The structure visualizes all eukaryotic-specific SRP and SR proteins and reveals their roles in stabilizing this conformation by forming a large protein assembly at the distal site of SRP RNA. We provide biochemical evidence that the guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis of SRP·SR is delayed at this stage, possibly to provide a time window for signal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e handover to the translocon.</p>

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells
<p>Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, device performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic devices. We report that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous light illumination leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic devices. Correlated, in situ structural and device characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar device, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%. The lattice expansion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>es, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor. The light-induced lattice expansion did not compromise the stability of these high-efficiency photovoltaic devices under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous operation at full-spectrum 1-sun (100 milliwatts per square centimeter) illumination for more than 1500 hours.</p>

Coherent single-atom superradiance

A generic interface to reduce the efficiency-stability-cost gap of perovskite solar cells

Tantalum-doped tungsten oxide (Ta-WO<i><sub>x</sub></i>)/conjugated polymer multilayers offer a surprisingly small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e barrier and form quasi-ohmic contacts universally with various scalable conjugated polymers.

DNA sequence-dependent epigenetic inheritance of gene silencing and histone H3K9 methylation
<p>Epigenetic inheritance mechanisms play fundamental roles in maintaining cellular memory of gene expression states. In fission yeast, histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) is methylated (H3K9me) at heterochromatic domains. These domains can be epigenetically inherited when <i>epe1<sup>+</sup></i>, encoding an enzyme that promotes H3K9 demethylation, is deleted. How native epigenetic states are stably maintained in <i>epe1<sup>+</sup></i> cells remains unknown. Here, we developed a system to examine the role of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e and genomic context in propagation of a cis-heritable H3K9me-dependent silenced state. We show that in <i>epe1<sup>+</sup></i> cells, in addition to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e-independent mechanisms that propagate H3K9me, epigenetic inheritance of silencing requires binding sites for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e-dependent activating transcription factor (ATF)–adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) response element–binding protein (CREB) family transcription factors within their native chromosomal context. Thus, specific DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es contribute to cis inheritance of H3K9me and silent epigenetic states.</p>

Evolution of Cold Acclimation and Its Role in Niche Transition in the Temperate Grass Subfamily Pooideae
<p>The grass subfamily Pooideae dominates the grass floras in cold temperate regions and has evolved complex physiological adaptations to cope with extreme environmental conditions like frost, winter, and seasonality. One such adaptation is cold acclimation, wherein plants increase their frost tolerance in response to gradually falling temperatures and shorter days in the autumn. However, understanding how complex traits like cold acclimation evolve remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigated the evolution of cold acclimation in Pooideae and found that a phylogenetically diverse set of Pooideae species displayed cold acclimation capacity. However, comparing differential gene expression after cold treatment in transcriptomes of five phylogenetically diverse species revealed widespread species-specific responses of genes with conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. Furthermore, we studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation between gene family size and number of cold-responsive genes as well as between selection pressure on coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es of genes and their cold responsiveness. We saw evidence of protein-coding and regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e evolution as well as the origin of novel genes and functions contributing toward evolution of a cold response in Pooideae. Our results reflect that selection pressure resulting from global cooling must have acted on already diverged lineages. Nevertheless, conservation of cold-induced gene expression of certain genes indicates that the Pooideae ancestor may have possessed some molecular machinery to mitigate cold stress. Evolution of adaptations to seasonally cold climates is regarded as particularly difficult. How Pooideae evolved to transition from tropical to temperate biomes sheds light on how complex traits evolve in the light of climate changes.</p>

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-loading pathway has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-loading types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. However, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the structure of PD has not been considered, even though it could impact permeability, and functional data are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, structure, and function using data from transmission electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was conducted for all relevant cell–cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>es in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-loading types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>es in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-loading type. PD density data of single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>es, even combined with PD diameter and length data, did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ate with the intercellular diffusion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD substructure not visible on standard transmission electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results support a proposed passive symplasmic loading mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD structure differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-loading species.</p>

The Coiled-Coil NLR <i>Rph1</i>, Confers Leaf Rust Resistance in Barley Cultivar Sudan
<p>Unraveling and exploiting mechanisms of disease resistance in cereal crops is currently limited by their large repeat-rich genomes and the lack of genetic recombination or cultivar (cv)-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e information. We cloned the first leaf rust resistance gene <i>Rph1</i> (<i>Rph1</i>.<i>a</i>) from cultivated barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) using “MutChromSeq,” a recently developed molecular genomics tool for the rapid cloning of genes in plants. Marker-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped <i>Rph1</i> to the short arm of chromosome 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the barley cv Morex reference assembly. A sodium azide mutant population in cv Sudan was generated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H chromosomes from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed and compared to identify candidate genes for the <i>Rph1</i> locus. MutChromSeq identified a single gene candidate encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate gene. Phylogenetic analysis determined that <i>Rph1</i> clustered separately from all previously cloned NLRs from the Triticeae and displayed highest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e similarity (89%) with a homolog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) disease resistance protein 1 protein in <i>Triticum urartu</i>.

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing information provided by paired-end <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) identified by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we identified insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. To map the locations of some complex insertions, we designed 49 molecular markers based on differences identified via whole-genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing between wild-type strains CC-124 and CC-125. Overall, MAPINS provides a low-cost, efficient method to characterize insertional mutants in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.</p>

Diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub> across the Mesophyll-Bundle Sheath Cell Interface in a C<sub>4</sub> Plant with Genetically Reduced PEP Carboxylase Activity
<p>Phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), localized to the cytosol of the mesophyll cell, catalyzes the first carboxylation step of the C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway. Here, we used RNA interference to target the cytosolic photosynthetic PEPC isoform in <i>Setaria viridis</i> and isolated independent transformants with very low PEPC activities. These plants required high ambient CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for growth, consistent with the essential role of PEPC in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The combination of estimating direct CO<sub>2</sub> fixation by the bundle sheath using gas-exchange measurements and modeling C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis with low PEPC activity allowed the calculation of bundle sheath conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>) in the progeny of these plants. Measurements made at a range of temperatures suggested no or negligible effect of temperature on <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> depending on the technique used to calculate <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. Anatomical measurements revealed that plants with reduced PEPC activity had reduced cell wall thickness and increased plasmodesmata (PD) density at the mesophyll-bundle sheath (M-BS) cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e, whereas we observed little difference in these parameters at the mesophyll-mesophyll cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e. The increased PD density at the M-BS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e was largely driven by an increase in the number of PD pit fields (cluster of PDs) rather than an increase in PD per pit field or the size of pit fields. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i> with bundle sheath surface area per leaf area and PD area per M-BS area showed that these parameters and cell wall thickness are important determinants of <i>g<sub>bs</sub></i>. It is intriguing to speculate that PD development is responsive to changes in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic flux.</p>

A Putative Protein <i>O</i>-Fucosyltransferase Facilitates Pollen Tube Penetration through the Stigma<i>–</i>Style Interface
<p>During pollen-pistil interactions in angiosperms, the male gametophyte (pollen) germinates to produce a pollen tube. To fertilize ovules located within the female pistil, the pollen tube must physically penetrate specialized tissues. Whereas the process of pollen tube penetration through the pistil has been anatomically well described, the genetic regulation remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gene, <i>O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>AtOFT1</i>), which plays a key role in pollen tube penetration through the stigma-style <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e. Semi-in vivo growth assays demonstrate that <i>oft1</i> mutant pollen tubes have a reduced ability to penetrate the stigma-style <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e, leading to a nearly 2,000-fold decrease in <i>oft1</i> pollen transmission efficiency and a 5- to 10-fold decreased seed set. We also demonstrate that AtOFT1 is localized to the Golgi apparatus, indicating its potential role in cellular glycosylation events. Finally, we demonstrate that <i>AtOFT1</i> and other similar Arabidopsis genes represent a novel clade of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es related to metazoan protein <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferases and that mutation of residues that are important for <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferase activity compromises AtOFT1 function in vivo.

Genome-Wide Analysis of the Arabidopsis Replication Timing Program
<p>Eukaryotes use a temporally regulated process, known as the replication timing program, to ensure that their genomes are fully and accurately duplicated during S phase. Replication timing programs are predictive of genomic features and activity and are considered to be functional readouts of chromatin organization. Although replication timing programs have been described for yeast and animal systems, much less is known about the temporal regulation of plant DNA replication or its relationship to genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e and chromatin structure. We used the thymidine analog, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, in combination with flow sorting and Repli-Seq to describe, at high-resolution, the genome-wide replication timing program for Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Col-0 suspension cells. We identified genomic regions that replicate predominantly during early, mid, and late S phase, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated these regions with genomic features and with data for chromatin state, accessibility, and long-distance interaction. Arabidopsis chromosome arms tend to replicate early while pericentromeric regions replicate late. Early and mid-replicating regions are gene-rich and predominantly euchromatic, while late regions are rich in transposable elements and primarily heterochromatic. However, the distribution of chromatin states across the different times is complex, with each replication time corresponding to a mixture of states. Early and mid-replicating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es interact with each other and not with late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, but early regions are more accessible than mid regions. The replication timing program in Arabidopsis reflects a bipartite genomic organization with early/mid-replicating regions and late regions forming separate, noninteracting compartments. The temporal order of DNA replication within the early/mid compartment may be modulated largely by chromatin accessibility.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into biological systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic biology. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. Ten and 16 amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es that often influence discrete aspects of plant biology. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Six-Rowed Spike3 (VRS3) Is a Histone Demethylase That Controls Lateral Spikelet Development in Barley
<p>The complex nature of crop genomes has long prohibited the efficient isolation of agronomically relevant genes. However, recent advances in next-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing technologies provide new ways to accelerate fine-mapping and gene isolation in crops. We used RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing of allelic <i>six-rowed spike3</i> (<i>vrs3</i>) mutants with altered spikelet development for gene identification and functional analysis in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Variant calling in two allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed that <i>VRS3</i> encodes a putative histone Lys demethylase with a conserved zinc finger and Jumonji C and N domain. Sanger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing of this candidate gene in independent allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed a series of mutations in conserved domains, thus confirming our candidate as the <i>VRS3</i> gene and suggesting that the row type in barley is determined epigenetically. Global transcriptional profiling in developing shoot apical meristems of <i>vrs3</i> suggested that VRS3 acts as a transcriptional activator of the row-type genes <i>VRS1</i> (<i>Hv.HOMEOBOX1</i>) and <i>INTERMEDIUM-C</i> (<i>INT-C</i>; <i>Hv.TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>). Comparative transcriptome analysis of the row-type mutants <i>vrs3</i>, <i>vrs4</i> (<i>Hv.RAMOSA2</i>), and <i>int-c</i> confirmed that all three genes act as transcriptional activators of <i>VRS1</i> and quantitative variation in the expression levels of <i>VRS1</i> in these mutants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with differences in the number of developed lateral spikelets. The identification of genes and pathways affecting seed number in small grain cereals will enable to further unravel the transcriptional networks controlling this important yield component.</p>

CRISPR-Cas9 Targeted Mutagenesis Leads to Simultaneous Modification of Different Homoeologous Gene Copies in Polyploid Oilseed Rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>)
<p>In polyploid species, altering a trait by random mutagenesis is highly inefficient due to gene redundancy. We have stably transformed tetraploid oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) with a CRISPR-Cas9 construct targeting two <i>ALCATRAZ</i> (<i>ALC</i>) homoeologs. <i>ALC</i> is involved in valve margin development and, thus, contributes to seed shattering from mature fruits. Knocking out <i>ALC</i> would increase shatter resistance to avoid seed loss during mechanical harvest. We obtained a transgenic T1 plant with four <i>alc</i> mutant alleles by the use of a single target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e. All mutations were stably inherited to the T2 progeny. The T2 generation was devoid of any wild-type alleles, proving that the underlying T1 was a nonchimeric double heterozygote. T-DNA and <i>ALC</i> loci were not linked, as indicated by random segregation in the T2 generation. Hence, we could select double mutants lacking the T-DNA already in the first offspring generation. However, whole-genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing data revealed at least five independent insertions of vector backbone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es. We did not detect any off-target effects in two genome regions homologous to the target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e. The simultaneous alteration of multiple homoeologs by CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis without any background mutations will offer new opportunities for using mutant genotypes in rapeseed breeding.</p>

Hornwort Stomata: Architecture and Fate Shared with 400-Million-Year-Old Fossil Plants without Leaves
<p>As one of the earliest plant groups to evolve stomata, hornworts are key to understanding the origin and function of stomata. Hornwort stomata are large and scattered on sporangia that grow from their bases and release spores at their tips. We present data from development and immunocytochemistry that identify a role for hornwort stomata that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with sporangial and spore maturation. We measured guard cells across the genera with stomata to assess developmental changes in size and to analyze any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation with genome size. Stomata form at the base of the sporophyte in the green region, where they develop differential wall thickenings, form a pore, and die. Guard cells collapse inwardly, increase in surface area, and remain perched over a substomatal cavity and network of intercellular spaces that is initially fluid filled. Following pore formation, the sporophyte dries from the outside inwardly and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>es to do so after guard cells die and collapse. Spore tetrads develop in spore mother cell walls within a mucilaginous matrix, both of which progressively dry before sporophyte dehiscence. A lack of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation between guard cell size and DNA content, lack of arabinans in cell walls, and perpetually open pores are consistent with the inactivity of hornwort stomata. Stomata are expendable in hornworts, as they have been lost twice in derived taxa. Guard cells and epidermal cells of hornworts show striking similarities with the earliest plant fossils. Our findings identify an architecture and fate of stomata in hornworts that is ancient and common to plants without sporophytic leaves.</p>

Chloroplast Preproteins Bind to the Dimer Interface of the Toc159 Receptor during Import
<p>Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as higher molecular weight preproteins and imported via the translocons in the outer (TOC) and inner (TIC) envelope membranes of chloroplasts. Toc159 functions as a primary receptor and directly binds preproteins through its dimeric GTPase domain. As a first step toward a molecular understanding of how Toc159 mediates preprotein import, we mapped the preprotein-binding regions on the Toc159 GTPase domain (Toc159G) of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) using cleavage by bound preproteins conjugated with the artificial protease FeBABE and cysteine-cysteine cross-linking. Our results show that residues at the dimer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e and the switch II region of Toc159G are in close proximity to preproteins. The mature portion of preproteins was observed preferentially at the dimer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e, whereas the transit peptide was found at both regions equally. Chloroplasts from transgenic plants expressing engineered Toc159 with a cysteine placed at the dimer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e showed increased cross-linking to bound preproteins. Our data suggest that, during preprotein import, the Toc159G dimer disengages and the dimer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">interfac</span></strong>e contacts translocating preproteins, which is consistent with a model in which conformational changes induced by dimer-monomer conversion in Toc159 play a direct role in facilitating preprotein import.</p>

Rapid Functional and Sequence Differentiation of a Tandemly Repeated Species-Specific Multigene Family in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene clusters of recently duplicated genes are hotbeds for evolutionary change. However, our understanding of how mutational mechanisms and evolutionary forces shape the structural and functional evolution of these clusters is hindered by the high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e identity among the copies, which typically results in their inaccurate representation in genome assemblies. The presumed testis-specific, chimeric gene <i>Sdic</i> originated, and tandemly expanded in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, contributing to increased male-male competition. Using various types of massively parallel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing data, we studied the organization, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e evolution, and functional attributes of the different <i>Sdic</i> copies. By leveraging long-read <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing data, we uncovered both copy number and order differences from the currently accepted annotation for the <i>Sdic</i> region. Despite evidence for pervasive gene conversion affecting the <i>Sdic</i> copies, we also detected signatures of two episodes of diversifying selection, which have contributed to the evolution of a variety of C-termini and miRNA binding site compositions. Expression analyses involving RNA-seq datasets from 59 different biological conditions revealed distinctive expression breadths among the copies, with three copies being transcribed in females, opening the possibility to a sexually antagonistic effect. Phenotypic assays using <i>Sdic</i> knock-out strains indicated that should this antagonistic effect exist, it does not compromise female fertility. Our results strongly suggest that the genome consolidation of the <i>Sdic</i> gene cluster is more the result of a quick exploration of different paths of molecular tinkering by different copies than a mere dosage increase, which could be a recurrent evolutionary outcome in the presence of persistent sexual selection.</p>

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Frequencies of Known Haplotypes from Pooled Sequence Data
<p>DNA samples are often pooled, either by experimental design or because the sample itself is a mixture. For example, when population allele frequencies are of primary interest, individual samples may be pooled together to lower the cost of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing. Alternatively, the sample itself may be a mixture of multiple species or strains (e.g., bacterial species comprising a microbiome or pathogen strains in a blood sample). We present an expectation–maximization algorithm for estimating haplotype frequencies in a pooled sample directly from mapped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e reads, in the case where the possible haplotypes are known. This method is relevant to the analysis of pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing data from selection experiments, as well as the calculation of proportions of different species within a metagenomics sample. Our method outperforms existing methods based on single-site allele frequencies, as well as simple approaches using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e read data. We have implemented the method in a freely available open-source software tool.</p>

Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (<i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>)
<p>Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical abilities are widespread among vertebrates. While experiments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in <i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia desert. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not controlled for non-numerical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli controlled for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous quantities and half not controlled for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli controlled for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous quantities proved able to learn the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish tested with visual stimuli.</p>

Correlation between genome reduction and bacterial growth
<p>Genome reduction by removing dispensable genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es in bacteria is commonly used in both fundamental and applied studies to determine the minimal genetic requirements for a living system or to develop highly efficient bioreactors. Nevertheless, whether and how the accumulative loss of dispensable genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es disturbs bacterial growth remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between genome reduction and growth, a series of <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains carrying genomes reduced in a stepwise manner were used. Intensive growth analyses revealed that the accumulation of multiple genomic deletions caused decreases in the exponential growth rate and the saturated cell density in a deletion-length-dependent manner as well as gradual changes in the patterns of growth dynamics, regardless of the growth media. Accordingly, a perspective growth model linking genome evolution to genome engineering was proposed. This study provides the first demonstration of a quantitative connection between genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e and bacterial growth, indicating that growth rate is potentially associated with dispensable genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es.</p>

The Major Origin of Seedless Grapes Is Associated with a Missense Mutation in the MADS-Box Gene <i>VviAGL11</i>
<p>Seedlessness is greatly prized by consumers of fresh grapes. While stenospermocarpic seed abortion determined by the <i>SEED DEVELOPMENT INHIBITOR</i> (<i>SDI</i>) locus is the usual source of seedlessness in commercial grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) cultivars, the underlying <i>sdi</i> mutation remains unknown. Here, we undertook an integrative approach to identify the causal mutation. Quantitative genetics and fine-mapping in two ‘Crimson Seedless’-derived F1 mapping populations confirmed the major effect of the <i>SDI</i> locus and delimited the <i>sdi</i> mutation to a 323-kb region on chromosome 18. RNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing comparing seed traces of seedless and seeds of seeded F1 individuals identified processes triggered during <i>sdi</i>-determined seed abortion, including the activation of salicylic acid-dependent autoimmunity. The RNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing data set was investigated for candidate genes, and while no evidence for causal cis-acting regulatory mutations was detected, deleterious nucleotide changes in coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es of the seedless haplotype were predicted in two genes within the <i>sdi</i> fine-mapping interval. Targeted re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing of the two genes in a collection of 124 grapevine cultivars showed that only the point variation causing the arginine-197-to-leucine substitution in the seed morphogenesis regulator gene <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE11</i> (<i>VviAGL11</i>) was fully linked with stenospermocarpy. The concurrent postzygotic variation identified for this missense polymorphism and seedlessness phenotype in seeded somatic variants of the original stenospermocarpic cultivar supports a causal effect. We postulate that seed abortion caused by this amino acid substitution in VviAGL11 is the major cause of seedlessness in cultivated grapevine. This information can be exploited to boost seedless grape breeding.</p>

Reproductive Long Intergenic Noncoding RNAs Exhibit Male Gamete Specificity and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2-Mediated Repression
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been characterized extensively in animals and are involved in several processes, including homeobox gene expression and X-chromosome inactivation. In comparison, there has been much less detailed characterization of plant lncRNAs, and the number of distinct lncRNAs encoded in plant genomes and their regulation by developmental and epigenetic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we analyzed transcriptome data from Asian rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and identified 6,309 long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), focusing on their expression in reproductive tissues and organs. Most <i>O. sativa</i> lincRNAs were expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner, with an unexpectedly high fraction specifically expressed in male gametes. Mutation of a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex2 (PRC2) resulted in derepression of another large class of lincRNAs, whose expression is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with H3K27 trimethylation in developing panicles. Overlap with the sperm cell-specific lincRNAs suggests that epigenetic repression of lincRNAs in the panicles was partially relieved in the male germline. Expression of a subset of lincRNAs also showed modulation by drought in reproductive tissues. Comparison with other cereal genomes showed that the lincRNAs generally have low levels of conservation at both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e and structural levels. Use of a novelty detection support vector machine model enabled the detection of nucleotide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e and structural homology in ∼10% and ∼4% of the lincRNAs in genomes of purple false brome (<i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), respectively. This is the first study to report on a large number of lncRNAs that are targets of repression by PRC2 rather than mediating regulation via PRC2. That the vast majority of the lincRNAs reported here do not overlap with those of other rice studies indicates that these are a significant addition to the known lincRNAs in rice.</p>

Proliferation of Regulatory DNA Elements Derived from Transposable Elements in the Maize Genome
<p>Genomic regions free of nucleosomes, which are hypersensitive to DNase I digestion, are known as DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) and frequently contain cis-regulatory DNA elements. To investigate their prevalence and characteristics in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we developed high-resolution genome-wide DHS maps using a modified DNase-seq technique. Maize DHSs exhibit depletion of nucleosomes and low levels of DNA methylation and are enriched with conserved noncoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es (CNSs). We developed a protoplast-based transient transformation assay to assess the potential gene expression enhancer and/or promoter functions associated with DHSs, which showed that more than 80% of DHSs overlapping with CNSs showed an enhancer function. Strikingly, nearly 25% of maize DHSs were derived from transposable elements (TEs), including both class I and class II transposons. Interestingly, TE-derived DHSs (teDHSs) homologous to retrotransposons were enriched with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es related to the intrinsic cis-regulatory elements within the long terminal repeats of retrotransposons. We demonstrate that more than 80% of teDHSs can drive transcription of a reporter gene in protoplast assays. These results reveal the widespread occurrence of TE-derived cis-regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es and suggest that teDHSs play a major role in transcriptional regulation in maize.</p>

Pausing of Chloroplast Ribosomes Is Induced by Multiple Features and Is Linked to the Assembly of Photosynthetic Complexes<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many mRNAs contain pause sites that briefly interrupt the progress of translation. Specific features that induce ribosome pausing have been described; however, their individual contributions to pause-site formation, and the overall biological significance of ribosome pausing, remain largely unclear. We have taken advantage of the compact genome of chloroplasts to carry out a plastid genome-wide survey of pause sites, as a basis for studying the impact of pausing on posttranslational processes. Based on ribosomal profiling of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) chloroplast mRNAs, we demonstrate that a combination of factors—mRNA secondary structure, internal Shine-Dalgarno <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es, and positively charged amino acids in the nascent peptide chain—explains 95% of the major pause sites on plastid mRNAs, whereas codon usage has little impact. The distribution of the pause sites is nonrandom and conforms to distinct patterns in the vicinity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es coding for transmembrane domains, which depend on their orientation within the membrane as well as being next to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>es coding for cofactor binding sites. We found strong indications that the mechanisms causing ribosomal pausing and at least some of the ribosomes pause sites are conserved between distantly related plant species. In addition, the positions of features that cause pausing are well conserved in photoautotrophic plants, but less so in their nonphotosynthetic, parasitic relatives, implying that the synthesis and assembly of photosynthetic multiprotein complexes requires localized ribosome pausing.</p>

An Improved <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS
<p>Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is used extensively for gene function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with silencing conducted through stable transformation, but many virus-silencing vectors, especially in grasses, induce only transient silencing phenotypes. A major reason for transient phenotypes is the instability of the foreign gene fragment (insert) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the development of a <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> (BMV)-based vector that better maintains inserts through modification of the original BMV vector RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e. Modification of the BMV RNA3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>e yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained <i>phytoene desaturase</i> and <i>heat shock protein70-1</i> (<i>HSP70-1</i>) inserts in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Longer maintenance of inserts was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with greater target gene silencing and more extensive visible silencing phenotypes displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more leaves. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in <i>N. benthamiana</i> after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of virus in this intermediate host used to produce virus inoculum for grass hosts. For <i>HSP70</i>, silencing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target gene knockdown and not a general effect of virus infection. The cause of the increased insert stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in grasses, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.</p>

The Chickpea <i>Early Flowering 1</i> (<i>Efl1</i>) Locus Is an Ortholog of Arabidopsis <i>ELF3</i>
<p>In climates that experience short growing seasons due to drought, heat, or end-of-season frost, early flowering is a highly desirable trait for chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). In this study, we mapped, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ed, and characterized <i>Early flowering3</i> (<i>Efl3</i>), an ortholog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>) that confers early flowering in chickpea. In a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between CDC Frontier and ICCV 96029, this gene was mapped to the site of a quantitative trait locus on Ca5 that explained 59% of flowering time variation under short days. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sequenc</span></strong>ing of <i>ELF3</i> in ICCV 96029 revealed an 11-bp deletion in the first exon that was predicted to result in a premature stop codon. The effect of this mutation was tested by transgenic complementation in the Arabidopsis <i>elf3-1</i> mutant, with the CDC Frontier form of <i>CaELF3a</i> partially complementing <i>elf3-1</i> while the ICCV 96029 form had no effect on flowering time. While induction of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> homologs was very early in ICCV 96029, an analysis of circadian clock function failed to show any clear loss of rhythm in the expression of clock genes in ICCV 96029 grown under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">continu</span></strong>ous light, suggesting redundancy with other <i>ELF3</i> homologs or possibly an alternative mode of action for this gene in chickpea. The 11-bp deletion was associated with early flowering in global chickpea germplasm but was not widely distributed, indicating that this mutation arose relatively recently.</p>

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in angiosperms, rapid tip growth in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton within the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> plays a crucial role in this polarized process. However, the mechanism underlying the polarity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-organizing protein, Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ating the polarity and distribution of the F-actin array. The rice <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth and a decreased germination rate of the pollen grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s display a disorganized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin polarity during tip growth. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the rice pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>, which is essential for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth and polarity as well as F-actin organization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during rice pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ating F-actin organization and array orientation in rice. This work provides insights into tip-focused cell growth and polarity.</p>

Pollen-Expressed Leucine-Rich Repeat Extensins Are Essential for Pollen Germination and Growth
<p>During pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth, the walls of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> provide the mechanical strength resisting turgor pressure to protect two sperm cells. Cell wall proteins may play an important role in this process. Pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> cell wall proteins known as leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) harbor a leucine-rich repeat domain and an extensin domain. In this study, the functions of four pollen-expressed LRXs, LRX8, LRX9, LRX10, and LRX11 (LRX8–11), were characterized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>LRX8–11</i> displayed a consistent expression pattern in mature pollen grains and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s. In a phenotypic analysis of four single mutants, six double mutants, four triple mutants, and a quadruple mutant, the triple and quadruple mutant plants displayed markedly reduced seed set and decreased male transmission efficiency accompanied by compromised pollen germination and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth. GFP-fused LRX8, LRX10, and LRX11 were found to be localized to pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> cell walls. An immunohistochemical analysis of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> cell wall polysaccharides showed an increase in the amount of rhamnogalacturonan I in the subapical walls of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s of the <i>lrx9 lrx10 lrx11</i> and <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutants and a decrease in the content of fucosylated xyloglucans in <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> compared with wild-type plants. Moreover, the callose content in the apical walls of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s increased in the <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutant. In conclusion, we propose that LRX8–11 function synergistically to maintain pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> cell wall integrity; thus, they play critical roles in pollen germination and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth.</p>

Spectral narrowing of x-ray pulses for precision spectroscopy with nuclear resonances
<p>Spectroscopy of nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances offers a wide range of applications due to the remarkable energy resolution afforded by their narrow linewidths. However, progress toward higher resolution is inhibited at modern x-ray sources because they deliver only a tiny fraction of the photons on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance, with the remainder contributing to an off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant background. We devised an experimental setup that uses the fast mechanical motion of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant target to manipulate the spectrum of a given x-ray pulse and to redistribute off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant spectral intensity onto the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance. As a consequence, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant pulse brilliance is increased while the off-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant background is reduced. Because our method is compatible with existing and upcoming pulsed x-ray sources, we anticipate that this approach will find applications that require ultranarrow x-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances.</p>

Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s could enable engineering of powerful new cellular behaviors. Rational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> design would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> architectures. In this study, we show that engineered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s of hacked orthogonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ar proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to generate regulatory cascades, binary logic gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally designed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene. Because CHOMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s can perform complex functions yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic integration, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> engineering for biotechnological applications.</p>

SMALL AUXIN UP RNA62/75 Are Required for the Translation of Transcripts Essential for Pollen Tube Growth
<p>Successful pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> elongation is critical for double fertilization, but the biological functions of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> genes and the regulatory machinery underlying this crucial process are largely unknown. A previous translatomic study revealed two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAUR</i> (<i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i>) genes, <i>SAUR62</i> and <i>SAUR75</i>, whose expression is up-regulated by pollination. Here, we found that both SAUR62 and SAUR75 localized mainly to pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> nuclei. The siliques of homozygous <i>saur62</i> (<i>saur62/−</i>), <i>saur75</i> (<i>saur75/−</i>), and the <i>SAUR62</i>/<i>75</i> RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown line had many aborted seeds. These lines had normal pollen viability but defective in vitro and in vivo pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth, with branching phenotypes. Immunoprecipitation with transgenic SAUR62/75-GFP flowers revealed ribosomal protein RPL12 family members as potential interacting partners, and their individual interactions were confirmed further by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Polysome profiling showed reduced 80S ribosome abundance in homozygous <i>saur62</i>, <i>saur75</i>, <i>ribosomal large subunit12c</i>, and <i>SAUR62/75</i> RNAi flowers, suggesting that SAUR62/75 play roles in ribosome assembly. To clarify their roles in translation, we analyzed total proteins from RNAi versus wild-type flowers by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, revealing significantly reduced expression of factors participating in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> wall biogenesis and F-actin dynamics, which are critical for the elastic properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> elongation. Indeed, RNAi pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s showed mislocalization of deesterified and esterified pectins and F-actin organization. Thus, the biological roles of SAUR62/75 and their RPL12 partners are critical in ribosomal pre-60S subunit assembly for efficient pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> elongation and subsequent fertilization.</p>

Gametophytic Pollen Tube Guidance: Attractant Peptides, Gametic Controls, and Receptors
<p>Pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> guidance in flowering plants is a unique and critical process for successful sexual reproduction. The pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> that grows from pollen, which is the male gametophyte, precisely navigates to the embryo sac, which is the female gametophyte, within the pistil. Recent advances have clarified the molecular framework of gametophytic pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> guidance. Multiple species-specific attractant peptides are secreted from synergid cells, the proper development and function of which are regulated by female gametes. Multiple receptor-like kinases on the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> tip are involved in sensing species-specific attractant peptides. In this Update article, recent progress in our understanding of the mechanism of gametophytic pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> guidance is reviewed, including attraction by synergid cells, control of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> guidance by female gametes, and directional growth of the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> by directional cue sensing. Future directions in the study of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> guidance also are discussed.</p>

<i>Arabidopsis</i> pollen tube integrity and sperm release are regulated by RALF-mediated signaling
<p>In flowering plants, fertilization requires complex cell-to-cell communication events between the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> and the female reproductive tissues, which are controlled by extracellular signaling molecules interacting with receptors at the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> surface. We found that two such receptors in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, BUPS1 and BUPS2, and their peptide ligands, RALF4 and RALF19, are pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>–expressed and are required to maintain pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> integrity. BUPS1 and BUPS2 interact with receptors ANXUR1 and ANXUR2 via their ectodomains, and both sets of receptors bind RALF4 and RALF19. These receptor-ligand interactions are in competition with the female-derived ligand RALF34, which induces pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> bursting at nanomolar concentrations. We propose that RALF34 replaces RALF4 and RALF19 at the interface of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>–female gametophyte contact, thereby deregulating BUPS-ANXUR signaling and in turn leading to pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> rupture and sperm release.</p>

The ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 Complex Mediates Pollen Tube Growth by Coordinating Vacuolar Targeting and Organization
<p>Pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth is an essential step for successful plant reproduction. Vacuolar trafficking and dynamic organization are important for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth; however, the key proteins involved in these processes are not well understood. Here, we report that the ADAPTOR PROTEIN-3 (AP-3) complex and its tonoplast cargo PROTEIN S-ACYL TRANSFERASE10 (PAT10) are critical for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). AP-3 is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of four subunits, δ, β, µ, and σ. AP-3 regulates tonoplast targeting of several cargoes, such as PAT10. We show that functional loss of any of the four AP-3 subunits reduces plant fertility. In <i>ap-3</i> mutants, pollen development was normal but pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth was compromised, leading to reduced male transmission. Functional loss of <i>PAT10</i> caused a similar reduction in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth, suggesting that the tonoplast association of PAT10 mediated by AP-3 is crucial for this process. Indeed, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient during pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth was reduced significantly due to <i>AP-3</i> loss of function, consistent with the abnormal targeting of CALCINUERIN B-LIKE2 (CBL2) and CBL3, whose tonoplast association depends on PAT10. Furthermore, we show that the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s of <i>ap-3</i> mutants have vacuoles with simplified tubules and bulbous structures, indicating that AP-3 affects vacuolar organization. Our results demonstrate a role for AP-3 in plant reproduction and provide insights into the role of vacuoles in polarized cell growth.</p>

Observation and stabilization of photonic Fock states in a hot radio-frequency resonator

In quantum optics, the ultimate limit of a weak field is a single photon.

A Putative Protein <i>O</i>-Fucosyltransferase Facilitates Pollen Tube Penetration through the Stigma<i>–</i>Style Interface
<p>During pollen-pistil interactions in angiosperms, the male gametophyte (pollen) germinates to produce a pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>. To fertilize ovules located within the female pistil, the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> must physically penetrate specialized tissues. Whereas the process of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> penetration through the pistil has been anatomically well described, the genetic regulation remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a novel Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gene, <i>O-FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1</i> (<i>AtOFT1</i>), which plays a key role in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> penetration through the stigma-style interface. Semi-in vivo growth assays demonstrate that <i>oft1</i> mutant pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s have a reduced ability to penetrate the stigma-style interface, leading to a nearly 2,000-fold decrease in <i>oft1</i> pollen transmission efficiency and a 5- to 10-fold decreased seed set. We also demonstrate that AtOFT1 is localized to the Golgi apparatus, indicating its potential role in cellular glycosylation events. Finally, we demonstrate that <i>AtOFT1</i> and other similar Arabidopsis genes represent a novel clade of sequences related to metazoan protein <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferases and that mutation of residues that are important for <i>O</i>-fucosyltransferase activity compromises AtOFT1 function in vivo. The results of this study elucidate a physiological function for AtOFT1 in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> penetration through the stigma-style interface and highlight the potential importance of protein <i>O</i>-glycosylation events in pollen-pistil interactions.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator is different from the average plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

SIPP, a Novel Mitochondrial Phosphate Carrier, Mediates in Self-Incompatibility
<p>In Solanaceae, the <i>S</i>-specific interaction between the pistil S-RNase and the pollen <i>S</i>-Locus F-box protein controls self-incompatibility (SI). Although this interaction defines the specificity of the pollen rejection response, the identification of three pistil essential modifier genes unlinked to the <i>S</i>-locus (<i>HT-B</i>, <i>120K</i>, and <i>NaStEP</i>) unveils a higher degree of complexity in the pollen rejection pathway. We showed previously that NaStEP, a stigma protein with homology with Kunitz-type protease inhibitors, is essential to SI in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. During pollination, NaStEP is taken up by pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s, where potential interactions with pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> proteins might underlie its function. Here, we identified NaSIPP, a mitochondrial protein with phosphate transporter activity, as a novel NaStEP-interacting protein. Coexpression of NaStEP and NaSIPP in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s showed interaction in the mitochondria, although when expressed alone, NaStEP remains mostly cytosolic, implicating NaSIPP-mediated translocation of NaStEP into the organelle. The <i>NaSIPP</i> transcript is detected specifically in mature pollen of <i>Nicotiana</i> spp.; however, in self-compatible plants, this gene has accumulated mutations, so its coding region is unlikely to produce a functional protein. RNA interference suppression of NaSIPP in <i>Nicotiana</i> spp. pollen grains disrupts the SI by preventing pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> inhibition. Taken together, our results are consistent with a model whereby the NaStEP and NaSIPP interaction, in incompatible pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s, might destabilize the mitochondria and contribute to arrest pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth.</p>

EXO70C2 Is a Key Regulatory Factor for Optimal Tip Growth of Pollen
<p>The exocyst, a eukaryotic tethering complex, coregulates targeted exocytosis as an effector of small GTPases in polarized cell growth. In land plants, several exocyst subunits are encoded by double or triple paralogs, culminating in tens of EXO70 paralogs. Out of 23 <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> EXO70 isoforms, we analyzed seven isoforms expressed in pollen. Genetic and microscopic analyses of single mutants in <i>EXO70A2</i>, <i>EXO70C1</i>, <i>EXO70C2</i>, <i>EXO70F1</i>, <i>EXO70H3</i>, <i>EXO70H5</i>, and <i>EXO70H6</i> genes revealed that only a loss-of-function <i>EXO70C2</i> allele resulted in a significant male-specific transmission defect (segregation 40%:51%:9%) due to aberrant pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth. Mutant pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s grown in vitro exhibited an enhanced growth rate and a decreased thickness of the tip cell wall, causing tip bursts. However, <i>exo70C2</i> pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s could frequently recover and restart their speedy elongation, resulting in a repetitive stop-and-go growth dynamics. A pollen-specific depletion of the closest paralog, <i>EXO70C1</i>, using artificial microRNA in the <i>exo70C2</i> mutant background, resulted in a complete pollen-specific transmission defect, suggesting redundant functions of EXO70C1 and EXO70C2. Both EXO70C1 and EXO70C2, GFP tagged and expressed under the control of their native promoters, localized in the cytoplasm of pollen grains, pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s, and also root trichoblast cells. The expression of EXO70C2-GFP complemented the aberrant growth of <i>exo70C2</i> pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s. The absent EXO70C2 interactions with core exocyst subunits in the yeast two-hybrid assay, cytoplasmic localization, and genetic effect suggest an unconventional EXO70 function possibly as a regulator of exocytosis outside the exocyst complex. In conclusion, EXO70C2 is a novel factor contributing to the regulation of optimal tip growth of Arabidopsis pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s.</p>

Cysteine-rich peptides promote interspecific genetic isolation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Reproductive isolation is a prerequisite for speciation. Failure of communication between female tissues of the pistil and paternal pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s imposes hybridization barriers in flowering plants. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> LURE1 (AtLURE1) peptides and their male receptor PRK6 aid attraction of the growing pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> to the ovule. Here, we report that the knockout of the entire <i>AtLURE1</i> gene family did not affect fertility, indicating that AtLURE1-PRK6–mediated signaling is not required for successful fertilization within one <i>Arabidopsis</i> species.

Complex signal processing in synthetic gene circuits using cooperative regulatory assemblies
<p>Eukaryotic genes are regulated by multivalent transcription factor complexes.

In this study, we apply this design principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative assemblies can program nonlinear gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying the strength and number of assembly subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and nonlinear regulatory responses for single- and multi-input <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator
<p>In metals, orbital motions of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in magnetic fields, which is manifested by quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in electrical resistivity. This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here, we report a notable exception in an insulator—ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB<sub>12</sub>).

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency stability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased damping leads to better stability and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator stability.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>latory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked lasers, microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical systems. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin lasers. The recent advent of hybrid photonic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that this silicon-based Brillouin laser enters a regime of dynamics in which optical self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lation produces phonon linewidth narrowing.

Calibrated mitotic oscillator drives motile ciliogenesis
<p>Cell division and differentiation depend on massive and rapid organelle remodeling. The mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator, centered on the cyclin-dependent kinase 1–anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (CDK1-APC/C) axis, spatiotemporally coordinates this reorganization in dividing cells. Here we discovered that nondividing cells could also implement this mitotic clocklike regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> to orchestrate subcellular reorganization associated with differentiation. We probed centriole amplification in differentiating mouse-brain multiciliated cells. These postmitotic progenitors fine-tuned mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator activity to drive the orderly progression of centriole production, maturation, and motile ciliation while avoiding the mitosis commitment threshold. Insufficient CDK1 activity hindered differentiation, whereas excessive activity accelerated differentiation yet drove postmitotic progenitors into mitosis. Thus, postmitotic cells can redeploy and calibrate the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator to uncouple cytoplasmic from nuclear dynamics for organelle remodeling associated with differentiation.</p>

History of winning remodels thalamo-PFC circuit to reinforce social dominance
<p>Mental strength and history of winning play an important role in the determination of social dominance. However, the neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s mediating these intrinsic and extrinsic factors have remained unclear. Working in mice, we identified a dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) neural population showing “effort”-related firing during moment-to-moment competition in the dominance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> test. Activation or inhibition of the dmPFC induces instant winning or losing, respectively. In vivo optogenetic-based long-term potentiation and depression experiments establish that the me<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diod</span></strong>orsal thalamic input to the dmPFC mediates long-lasting changes in the social dominance status that are affected by history of winning.

Mechanistic basis for a molecular triage reaction
<p>Newly synthesized proteins are triaged between biosynthesis and degradation to maintain cellular homeostasis, but the decision-making mechanisms are unclear. We reconstituted the core reactions for membrane targeting and ubiquitination of nascent tail-anchored membrane proteins to understand how their fate is determined. The central six-component triage system is divided into an uncommitted client-SGTA complex, a self-sufficient targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e, and an embedded but self-sufficient quality control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e. Client-SGTA engagement of the targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e induces rapid, private, and committed client transfer to TRC40 for successful biosynthesis.

Our results provide a paradigm for how priority and time are encoded within a multichaperone triage system.</p>

Dynamics of the Pollen Sequestrome Defined by Subcellular Coupled Omics
<p>Reproduction success in angiosperm plants depends on robust pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth through the female pistil tissues to ensure successful fertilization. Accordingly, there is an apparent evolutionary trend to accumulate significant reserves during pollen maturation, including a population of stored mRNAs, that are utilized later for a massive translation of various proteins in growing pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s. Here, we performed a thorough transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of stored and translated transcripts in three subcellular compartments of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), long-term storage EDTA/puromycin-resistant particles, translating polysomes, and free ribonuclear particles, throughout tobacco pollen development and in in vitro-growing pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s. We demonstrated that the composition of the aforementioned complexes is not rigid and that numerous transcripts were redistributed among these complexes during pollen development, which may represent an important mechanism of translational regulation. Therefore, we defined the pollen sequestrome as a distinct and highly dynamic compartment for the storage of stable, translationally repressed transcripts and demonstrated its dynamics. We propose that EDTA/puromycin-resistant particle complexes represent aggregated nontranslating monosomes as the primary mediators of messenger RNA sequestration. Such organization is extremely useful in fast tip-growing pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s, where rapid and orchestrated protein synthesis must take place in specific regions.</p>

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator period are thought to adjust the timing of biological activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the dynamic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the dynamic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of biological events. Our data provide insight into how the dynamic period adjustment of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and metabolism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the rotation of the planet. Photosynthesis is a key metabolic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of photosynthesis, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from photosynthesis also feeds back to regulate the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by stabilizing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the stability of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

Analysis of Exocyst Subunit EXO70 Family Reveals Distinct Membrane Polar Domains in Tobacco Pollen Tubes
<p>The vesicle-tethering complex exocyst is one of the crucial cell polarity regulators. The EXO70 subunit is required for the targeting of the complex and is represented by many isoforms in angiosperm plant cells. This diversity could be partly responsible for the establishment and maintenance of membrane domains with different composition. To address this hypothesis, we employed the growing pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>, a well-established cell polarity model system, and performed large-scale expression, localization, and functional analysis of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) EXO70 isoforms. Various isoforms localized to different regions of the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> plasma membrane, apical vesicle-rich inverted cone region, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The overexpression of major pollen-expressed EXO70 isoforms resulted in growth arrest and characteristic phenotypic deviations of tip swelling and apical invaginations. NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 occupied two distinct and mutually exclusive plasma membrane domains. Both isoforms partly colocalized with the exocyst subunit NtSEC3a at the plasma membrane, possibly forming different exocyst complex subpopulations. NtEXO70A1a localized to the small area previously characterized as the site of exocytosis in the tobacco pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>, while NtEXO70B1 surprisingly colocalized with the zone of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Both NtEXO70A1a and NtEXO70B1 colocalized to different degrees with markers for the anionic signaling phospholipids phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid. In contrast, members of the EXO70 C class, which are specifically expressed in tip-growing cells, exhibited exocytosis-related functional effects in pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s despite the absence of apparent plasma membrane localization. Taken together, our data support the existence of multiple membrane-trafficking domains regulated by different EXO70-containing exocyst complexes within a single cell.</p>

Metabolic Control of Tobacco Pollination by Sugars and Invertases
<p>Pollination in flowering plants is initiated by germination of pollen grains on stigmas followed by fast growth of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s representing highly energy-consuming processes. The symplastic isolation of pollen grains and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s requires import of Suc available in the apoplast. We show that the functional coupling of Suc cleavage by invertases and uptake of the released hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollination in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolocalization of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo support the functional coupling in supplying carbohydrates for pollen germination and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated expression. Detection of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk between male and female tissues and supported the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollination. Tissue-specific expression of an invertase inhibitor and addition of the chemical invertase inhibitor miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired pollen germination. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously available Suc into the germinating pollen operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after cleavage by extracellular invertase. Reduction of extracellular invertase activity in pollen decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises pollen germination. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for pollen germination, whereas Suc is supporting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> growth, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulation of pollination by carbohydrates.</p>

Structure-Activity Relation of AMOR Sugar Molecule That Activates Pollen-Tubes for Ovular Guidance
<p>Successful fertilization in flowering plants depends on the precise directional growth control of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> through the female pistil tissue toward the female gametophyte contained in the ovule for delivery of nonmotile sperm cells. Cys-rich peptides LUREs secreted from the synergid cells on either side of the egg cell act as ovular attractants of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s. Competency control by the pistil is crucial for the response of pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>s to these ovular attractants. We recently reported that ovular 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl arabinogalactan (AMOR) induces competency of the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> to respond to ovular attractant LURE peptides in <i>Torenia fournieri.</i> The beta isomer of the terminal disaccharide 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl galactose was essential and sufficient for the competency induction. However, critical and noncritical structures in the disaccharide have not been dissected deeply. Herein, we report the synthesis of new AMOR analogs and the structure-activity relationships for AMOR activity in the presence of these synthesized analogs. Removal of 4-<i>O</i>-methyl group or –COOH from the glucuronosyl residue of the disaccharide dramatically reduces AMOR activity. The pyranose backbone of the second sugar of disaccharide is essential for the activity but not hydroxy groups. The role of beta isomer of the disaccharide 4-Me-GlcA-β(1,6)-Gal is very specific for competency control, as there was no difference in effect among the sugar analogs tested for pollen germination. This study represents the first structure-activity relationship study, to our knowledge, of a sugar molecule involved in plant reproduction, which opens a way for modification of the molecule without loss of activity.</p>

As expected, 2 previously reported miR-22 target genes, MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and histone deacetylase 4, exhibited a regulatory role in VSMC phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation. A transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein, EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 protein homolog), has been identified as a novel miR-22 target gene in VSMC phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of miR-22 in the injured vessels significantly reduced the expression of its target genes, decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries, whereas the opposite effect was observed with local application of a miR-22 inhibitor to injured arteries. We next examined the clinical relevance of miR-22 expression and its target genes in human femoral arteries. We found that miR-22 expression was significantly reduced, whereas MECP2 and EVI1 expression levels were dramatically increased, in diseased in comparison with healthy femoral human arteries. This inverse relationship between miR-22 and MECP2 and EVI1 was evident in both healthy and diseased human femoral arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate that miR-22 and EVI1 are novel regulators of VSMC function, specifically during neointima hyperplasia, offering a novel therapeutic opportunity for treating vascular diseases.</p></sec>

MicroRNA-93 Controls Perfusion Recovery After Hindlimb Ischemia by Modulating Expression of Multiple Genes in the Cell Cycle Pathway
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>MicroRNAs are key regulators of gene expression in response to injury, but there is limited knowledge of their role in ischemia-induced angiogenesis, such as in peripheral arterial disease. Here, we used an unbiased strategy and took advantage of different phenotypic outcomes that follow surgically induced hindlimb ischemia between inbred mouse strains to identify key microRNAs involved in perfusion recovery from hindlimb ischemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>From comparative microRNA profiling between inbred mouse strains that display profound differences in their extent of perfusion recovery after hindlimb ischemia, we found that the mouse strain with higher levels of microRNA-93 (miR-93) in hindlimb muscle before ischemia and the greater ability to upregulate miR-93 in response to ischemia had better perfusion recovery. In vitro, overexpression of miR-93 attenuated hypoxia-induced apoptosis in both endothelial and skeletal muscle cells and enhanced proliferation in both cell types. In addition, miR-93 overexpression enhanced endothelial cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong> formation. In vivo, miR-93 overexpression enhanced capillary density and perfusion recovery from hindlimb ischemia, and antagomirs to miR-93 attenuated perfusion recovery. Both in vitro and in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of miR-93 resulted in alterations in the expression of >1 cell cycle pathway gene in 2 different cell types.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Our data indicate that miR-93 enhances perfusion recovery from hindlimb ischemia by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of multiple genes that coordinate the functional pathways of cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience. As explosions pattern the sky, the visual system must capture information about the time-varying positions, colors, and contrasts of myriad spots of light. This testament to high-acuity vision necessitates the development of neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s that map visual space. To generate this retinotopy (visual mapping), neurons must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved? The molecules that regulate neuronal differentiation have been described in detail, as have the cues that allow differentiated neurons to reach and choose their synaptic partners (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, the mechanisms that coordinate neuronal specification with the development of retinotopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> wiring have remained elusive. On page 886 of this issue, Fernandes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that in the visual system of flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), photoreceptors use glial cells as intermediaries to communicate with their neural targets to generate retinotopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s.</p>

Robust epitaxial growth of two-dimensional heterostructures, multiheterostructures, and superlattices
<p>We report a general synthetic strategy for highly robust growth of diverse lateral heterostructures, multiheterostructures, and superlattices from two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals. A reverse flow during the temperature-swing stage in the sequential vapor deposition growth process allowed us to cool the existing 2D crystals to prevent undesired thermal degradation and uncontrolled homogeneous nucleation, thus enabling highly robust block-by-block epitaxial growth. Raman and photoluminescence mapping studies showed that a wide range of 2D heterostructures (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>-MoSe<sub>2</sub>), multiheterostructures (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>-MoSe<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>), and superlattices (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub>) were readily prepared with precisely controlled spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation. Transmission electron microscope studies showed clear chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation with atomically sharp interfaces.

In situ architecture, function, and evolution of a contractile injection system
<p>Contractile injection systems mediate bacterial cell-cell interactions by a bacteriophage tail–like structure. In contrast to extracellular systems, the type 6 secretion system (T6SS) is defined by intracellular localization and attachment to the cytoplasmic membrane. Here we used cryo-focused ion beam milling, electron cryotomography, and functional assays to study a T6SS in <i>Amoebophilus asiaticus</i>. The in situ architecture revealed three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>es, including a contractile sheath-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tube</span></strong>, a baseplate, and an anchor. All <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>es showed conformational changes upon firing. Lateral baseplate interactions coordinated T6SSs in hexagonal arrays. The system mediated interactions with host membranes and may participate in phagosome escape. Evolutionary sequence analyses predicted that T6SSs are more widespread than previously thought. Our insights form the basis for understanding T6SS key concepts and exploring T6SS diversity.</p>

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices
<p>Cyclotron motion of charge carriers in metals and semiconductors leads to Landau quantization and magneto-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>latory behavior in their properties. Cryogenic temperatures are usually required to observe these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations. We show that graphene superlattices support a different type of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lation that does not rely on Landau quantization. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that charge carriers experience effectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Our work hints at unexplored physics in Hofstadter butterfly systems at high temperatures.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant and wave-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

Branch-specific plasticity of a bifunctional dopamine circuit encodes protein hunger
<p>Free-living animals must not only regulate the amount of food they consume but also choose which types of food to ingest. The shifting of food preference driven by nutrient-specific hunger can be essential for survival, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms. We identified a dopamine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> that encodes protein-specific hunger in <i>Drosophila</i>. The activity of these neurons increased after substantial protein deprivation. Activation of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> simultaneously promoted protein intake and restricted sugar consumption, via signaling to distinct downstream neurons. Protein starvation triggered branch-specific plastic changes in these dopaminergic neurons, thus enabling sustained protein consumption. These studies reveal a crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> mechanism by which animals adjust their dietary strategy to maintain protein homeostasis.</p>

Formation of matter-wave soliton trains by modulational instability

Epitaxial lift-off of electrodeposited single-crystal gold foils for flexible electronics
<p>We introduce a simple and inexpensive procedure for epitaxial lift-off of wafer-size flexible and transparent foils of single-crystal gold using silicon as a template. Lateral electrochemical undergrowth of a sacrificial SiO<i><sub>x</sub></i> layer was achieved by photoelectrochemically oxidizing silicon under light irradiation. A 28-nanometer-thick gold foil with a sheet resistance of 7 ohms per square showed only a 4% increase in resistance after 4000 bending cycles. A flexible organic light-emitting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diod</span></strong>e based on tris(bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) that was spin-coated on a foil exploited the transmittance and flexibility of the gold foil. Cuprous oxide as an inorganic semiconductor that was epitaxially electrodeposited onto the gold foils exhibited a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diod</span></strong>e quality factor <i>n</i> of 1.6 (where <i>n</i> = 1.0 for an ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diod</span></strong>e), compared with a value of 3.1 for a polycrystalline deposit.

Lipid transport by TMEM24 at ER–plasma membrane contacts regulates pulsatile insulin secretion
<p>Insulin is released by β cells in pulses regulated by calcium and phosphoinositide signaling. Here, we describe how transmembrane protein 24 (TMEM24) helps coordinate these signaling events. We showed that TMEM24 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–anchored membrane protein whose reversible localization to ER-plasma membrane (PM) contacts is governed by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in cytosolic calcium. A lipid-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e in TMEM24 transports the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] precursor phosphatidylinositol between bilayers, allowing replenishment of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolyzed during signaling. In the absence of TMEM24, calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations are abolished, leading to a defect in triggered insulin release. Our findings implicate direct lipid transport between the ER and the PM in the control of insulin secretion, a process impaired in patients with type II diabetes.</p>

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The dynamics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of wave packets. However, the rapidity of electron dynamics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of electron wave packets in the time domain. Using spectrally resolved electron interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photoelectron wave packet created through a Fano autoionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference wave packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ant wave packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reson</span></strong>ance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission dynamics governed by electron correlation, as well as coherent control over structured electron wave packets.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single chemical, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling molecules were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-molecules and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ators (substances often released with small-molecule neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong>s operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">circuit</span></strong> function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

<i>Trichoderma</i> Histone Deacetylase HDA-2 Modulates Multiple Responses in Arabidopsis

In filamentous fungi, chromatin modifications regulate secondary metabolism. In this study we investigated how the absence of histone deacetylase HDA-2 in the <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> strain Δ<i>hda-2</i> impacts its effect on a host, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The production of VOCs and their impact on plant growth and development were assessed as well. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> strain was impaired in its ability to colonize Arabidopsis roots, thus affecting the promotion of plant growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ation of plant defenses against foliar pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, which normally result from interaction with <i>T. atroviride</i>. Furthermore, Δ<i>hda-2</i> VOCs were incapable of triggering plant defenses to counterattack foliar pathogens. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> overproduced the VOC 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP), which resulted in enhanced root branching and differentially regulated phytohormone-related genes. Analysis of ten VOCs (including 6-PP) revealed that three of them positively regulated plant growth, whereas six had the opposite effect. Assessment of secondary metabolites, detoxification, and communication with plant-related genes showed a dual role for HDA-2 in <i>T. atroviride</i> gene expression regulation during its interaction with plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 on the promoters of plant-responsive genes in Δ<i>hda-2</i> showed, in the presence of Arabidopsis, low levels of <i>epl-1</i> and <i>abc-2</i> compared with that in the wild type; whereas <i>ctf-1</i> presented high constitutive levels, supporting a dual role of HDA-2 in gene regulation.

Root Gravitropism Is Regulated by a Crosstalk between <i>para</i>-Aminobenzoic Acid, Ethylene, and Auxin
<p>Plants respond to gravitational force through directional growth along the gravity vector. Although auxin is the central component of the root graviresponse, it works in concert with other plant hormones. Here, we show that the folate precursor <i>para</i>-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ator of the auxin-ethylene interplay during root gravitropism in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In gravistimulated roots, PABA promotes an asymmetric auxin response, which causes the asymmetric growth responsible for root curvature. This activity requires the auxin response transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7) and ARF19 as well as ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, indicating that PABA activity requires both auxin and ethylene pathways. Similar to ethylene, exogenous PABA reverses the agravitropic root growth of the auxin transport mutant <i>pin-formed2</i> (<i>pin2</i>) and the auxin biosynthetic double mutant with loss of function of <i>weak ethylene insensitive</i> (<i>wei</i>) genes, <i>wei8wei2</i>, but not the <i>pin2wei8wei2</i> triple mutant. This finding suggests that PABA regulates the ethylene-dependent reciprocal compensation between auxin transport and biosynthesis. Furthermore, manipulation of endogenous free PABA levels by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ating the expression of the gene encoding its glucosylation enzyme, UDP-GLYCOSYL TRANSFERASE75B1, impacts the root graviresponse, suggesting that endogenous free PABA levels may play a crucial role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ating the auxin-ethylene cross talk necessary for root gravitropism.</p>

The <i>MicroRNA390</i>/<i>TRANS-ACTING SHORT INTERFERING RNA3</i> Module Mediates Lateral Root Growth under Salt Stress via the Auxin Pathway
<p>Salt-induced developmental plasticity in a plant root system strongly depends on auxin signaling. However, the molecular events underlying this process are poorly understood. <i>MicroRNA390</i> (<i>miR390</i>), <i>trans-actin small interfering RNA</i>s (<i>tasiRNA</i>s), and <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs</i> (<i>ARFs</i>) form a regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e involved in controlling lateral root (LR) growth. Here, we found that <i>miR390</i> expression was strongly induced by exposure to salt during LR formation in poplar (<i>Populus</i> spp.) plants. <i>miR390</i> overexpression stimulated LR development and increased salt tolerance, whereas <i>miR390</i> knockdown caused by a short tandem target mimic repressed LR growth and compromised salt resistance. <i>ARF3.1</i>, <i>ARF3.2</i>, and <i>ARF4</i> expression was inhibited significantly by the presence of salt, and transcript abundance was decreased dramatically in the <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing line but increased in the <i>miR390</i>-knockdown line. Constitutive expression of <i>ARF4m</i> harboring mutated <i>trans-acting small interfering ARF</i>-binding sites removed the salt resistance of the <i>miR390</i> overexpressors. <i>miR390</i> positively regulated auxin signaling in LRs subjected to salt, but <i>ARF4</i> inhibited auxin signaling. Salinity stabilized the poplar Aux/IAA repressor INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID17.1, and overexpression of an auxin/salt-resistant form of this repressor suppressed LR growth in <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing and <i>ARF4</i>-RNA interfering lines in the presence of salt. Thus, the <i>miR390/TAS3/ARFs</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>e is a key regulator, via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">modul</span></strong>ating the auxin pathway, of LR growth in poplar subjected to salt stress.</p>

The sHSP22 Heat Shock Protein Requires the ABI1 Protein Phosphatase to Modulate Polar Auxin Transport and Downstream Responses

We performed a microarray analysis using the loss-of-function mutant <i>abi1-3</i> and Col-0 seedlings treated with IAA. For <i>sHSP22</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) small heat shock protein-encoding gene, the induction by IAA was dependent on <i>ABI1</i>. <i>shsp22</i> displayed enhanced sensitivity to ABA in primary root growth. In contrast, overexpression of full-length, but not truncated sHSP22 lacking signal peptide and ER-retention sequences, resulted in decreased ABA sensitivity. Overexpressed (OX) <i>sHSP22</i> partially rescued the ABA hypersensitivity of <i>abi1-3</i>. In addition, <i>sHSP22</i> is involved in auxin-regulated hypocotyl elongation at high temperature treatment. <i>sHSP22</i> also affected accumulation of auxin efflux carrier PIN proteins due to potentiated intracellular trafficking.

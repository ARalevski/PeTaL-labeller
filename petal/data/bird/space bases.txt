A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d Plant Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although age-associated changes in left ventricular diastolic function are well recognized, limited data exist characterizing measures of diastolic function in older adults, including both reference ranges reflecting the older adult population and prognostically relevant values for incident heart failure (HF), as well as their associations with circulating biomarkers of HF risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among 5801 elderly participants in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; age range, 67–90 years; mean age, 76±5 years; 42% male; 21% black), we determined the continuous association of diastolic measures (tissue Doppler imaging [TDI] e’, E/e’, and left atrial size) with concomitant N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and subsequent HF hospitalization or death. We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these measures using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each measure of diastolic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for risk supportive of ARIC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d limits. ARIC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d limits for diastolic function improved risk discrimination over guideline-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d cut points <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal diastolic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal diastolic function and were at low risk of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal measures and were at intermediate risk (2.4%/y), and all 3 diastolic measures were abnormal in 5% who were at high risk (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign. The use of age-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d normative values when considering an elderly population improves the risk discrimination of diastolic measures for incident HF or death.</p></sec>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of plants are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d studies such as photosynthesis modeling. However, the construction of accurate 3D plant models is challenging, as plants are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all plants, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target plant, tuning camera placement to match the plant’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic plant modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d plant reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different plant structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of plant types.</p>

A Virus-Induced Assay for Functional Dissection and Analysis of Monocot and Dicot Flowering Time Genes
<p>Virus-induced flowering (VIF) uses virus vectors to express <i>Flowering Locus T</i> (<i>FT</i>) to induce flowering in plants. This approach has recently attracted wide interest for its practical applications in accelerating breeding in crops and woody fruit trees. However, the insight into VIF and its potential as a powerful tool for dissecting florigenic proteins remained to be elucidated. Here, we describe the mechanism and further applications of <i>Potato virus X</i> (PVX)-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF in the short-day <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> cultivar Maryland Mammoth. Ectopic delivery of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AtFT</i> by PVX/AtFT did not induce the expression of the endogenous <i>FT</i> ortholog <i>NtFT4</i>; however, it was sufficient to trigger flowering in Maryland Mammoth plants grown under noninductive long-day conditions. Infected tobacco plants developed no systemic symptoms, and the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF did not cause transgenerational flowering. We showed that the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF is a much more rapid method to examine the impacts of single amino acid mutations on AtFT for floral induction than making individual transgenic Arabidopsis lines for each mutation. We also used the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF to demonstrate that adding a His- or FLAG-tag to the N or C terminus of AtFT could affect its florigenic activity and that this system can be applied to assay the function of <i>FT</i> genes from heterologous species, including tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>SFT</i> and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>Hd3a</i>. Thus, the PVX-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d VIF represents a simple and efficient system to identify individual amino acids that are essential for FT-mediated floral induction and to test the ability of mono- and dicotyledonous <i>FT</i> genes and FT fusion proteins to induce flowering.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity
<p>During winter, trees have to cope with harsh conditions, including extreme freeze-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell damage and was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on in situ monitoring of xylem (thermocouples) and surface temperatures (infrared imaging), ultrasonic emissions, and dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine timberline revealed three distinct freezing patterns: (1) from the top of the tree toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>, and (3) from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of freezing processes in trees. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon freezing, were both related to minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit and soil temperature. These complex patterns, emphasizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter tree physiology.</p>

The Persistent Homology Mathematical Framework Provides Enhanced Genotype-to-Phenotype Associations for Plant Morphology
<p>Efforts to understand the genetic and environmental conditioning of plant morphology are hindered by the lack of flexible and effective tools for quantifying morphology. Here, we demonstrate that persistent-homology-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d topological methods can improve measurement of variation in leaf shape, serrations, and root architecture. We apply these methods to 2D images of leaves and root systems in field-grown plants of a domesticated introgression line population of tomato (<i>Solanum pennellii</i>). We find that compared with some commonly used conventional traits, (1) persistent-homology-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d methods can more comprehensively capture morphological variation; (2) these techniques discriminate between genotypes with a larger normalized effect size and detect a greater number of unique quantitative trait loci (QTLs); (3) multivariate traits, whether statistically derived from univariate or persistent-homology-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d traits, improve our ability to understand the genetic basis of phenotype; and (4) persistent-homology-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d techniques detect unique QTLs compared to conventional traits or their multivariate derivatives, indicating that previously unmeasured aspects of morphology are now detectable. The QTL results further imply that genetic contributions to morphology can affect both the shoot and root, revealing a pleiotropic basis to natural variation in tomato. Persistent homology is a versatile framework to quantify plant morphology and developmental processes that complements and extends existing methods.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

An Evidence-Based Medicine Approach to Antihyperglycemic Therapy in Diabetes Mellitus to Overcome Overtreatment
<p>Overtreatment is pervasive in medicine and leads to potential patient harms and excessive costs in health care. Although evidence-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d medicine is often derided as practice by rote algorithmic medicine, the appropriate application of key evidence-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d medicine principles in clinical decision making is fundamental to preventing overtreatment and promoting high-value, individualized patient-centered care. Specifically, this article discusses the importance of (1) using absolute rather than relative estimates of benefits to inform treatment decisions; (2) considering the time horizon to benefit of treatments; (3) balancing potential harms and benefits; and (4) using shared decision making by physicians to incorporate the patient’s values and preferences into treatment decisions. Here, we illustrate the application of these principles to considering the decision of whether or not to recommend intensive glycemic control to patients to minimize microvascular and cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Through this lens, this example will illustrate how an evidence-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d medicine approach can be used to individualize glycemic goals and prevent overtreatment, and can serve as a template for applying evidence-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d medicine to inform treatment decisions for other conditions to optimize health and individualize patient care.</p>

CD45 exclusion– and cross-linking–based receptor signaling together broaden FcεRI reactivity
<p>For many years, the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin E (IgE) FcεRI, which is expressed by mast cells and basophils, has been widely held to be the exemplar of cross-linking (that is, aggregation dependent) signaling receptors. We found, however, that FcεRI signaling could occur in the presence or absence of receptor cross-linking. Using both cell and cell-free systems, we showed that FcεRI signaling was stimulated by surface-associated monovalent ligands through the passive, size-dependent exclusion of the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase CD45 from plasma membrane regions of FcεRI-ligand engagement. Similarly to the T cell receptor, FcεRI signaling could also be initiated in a ligand-independent manner. These data suggest that a simple mechanism of CD45 exclusion–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d receptor triggering could function together with cross-linking–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d FcεRI signaling, broadening mast cell and basophil reactivity by enabling these cells to respond to both multivalent and surface-presented monovalent antigens. These findings also strengthen the case that a size-dependent, phosphatase exclusion–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d receptor triggering mechanism might serve generally to facilitate signaling by noncatalytic immune receptors.</p>

We found that the addition of guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) resulted in marked improvements in the structural and optoelectronic properties of Sn-Pb mixed, low–band gap (~1.25 electron volt) perovskite films. The films have defect densities that are lower by a factor of 10, leading to carrier lifetimes of greater than 1 microsecond and diffusion lengths of 2.5 micrometers. These improved properties enable our demonstration of >20% efficient low–band gap PSCs. When combined with wider–band gap PSCs, we achieve 25% efficient four-terminal and 23.1% efficient two-terminal all-perovskite–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d polycrystalline thin-film tandem solar cells.</p>

Cytosine, but not adenine, base editors induce genome-wide off-target mutations in rice
<p>Cytosine and adenine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> editors (CBEs and ABEs) are promising new tools for achieving the precise genetic changes required for disease treatment and trait improvement. However, genome-wide and unbiased analyses of their off-target effects in vivo are still lacking. Our whole-genome sequencing analysis of rice plants treated with the third-generation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> editor (BE3), high-fidelity BE3 (HF1-BE3), or ABE revealed that BE3 and HF1-BE3, but not ABE, induce substantial genome-wide off-target mutations, which are mostly the C→T type of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and appear to be enriched in genic regions. Notably, treatment of rice with BE3 or HF1-BE3 in the absence of single-guide RNA also results in the rise of genome-wide SNVs. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>-editing unit of BE3 or HF1-BE3 needs to be optimized in order to attain high fidelity.</p>

Cytosine base editor generates substantial off-target single-nucleotide variants in mouse embryos
<p>Genome editing holds promise for correcting pathogenic mutations. However, it is difficult to determine off-target effects of editing due to single-nucleotide polymorphism in individuals. Here we developed a method named GOTI (genome-wide off-target analysis by two-cell embryo injection) to detect off-target mutations by editing one blastomere of two-cell mouse embryos using either CRISPR-Cas9 or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> editors. Comparison of the whole-genome sequences of progeny cells of edited and nonedited blastomeres at embryonic day 14.5 showed that off-target single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were rare in embryos edited by CRISPR-Cas9 or adenine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> editor, with a frequency close to the spontaneous mutation rate. By contrast, cytosine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> editing induced SNVs at more than 20-fold higher frequencies, requiring a solution to address its fidelity.</p>

Single-cell mapping of gene expression landscapes and lineage in the zebrafish embryo
<p>High-throughput mapping of cellular differentiation hierarchies from single-cell data promises to empower systematic interrogations of vertebrate development and disease. Here we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to >92,000 cells from zebrafish embryos during the first day of development. Using a graph-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d approach, we mapped a cell-state landscape that describes axis patterning, germ layer formation, and organogenesis. We tested how clonally related cells traverse this landscape by developing a transposon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d barcoding approach (TracerSeq) for reconstructing single-cell lineage histories. Clonally related cells were often restricted by the state landscape, including a case in which two independent lineages converge on similar fates.

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The structure reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the cavities. Separate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>. Comparison with the C128T structure reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>’s interactions.</p>

Nucleic acid detection with CRISPR-Cas13a/C2c2
<p>Rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive nucleic acid detection may aid point-of-care pathogen detection, genotyping, and disease monitoring. The RNA-guided, RNA-targeting clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) effector Cas13a (previously known as C2c2) exhibits a “collateral effect” of promiscuous ribonuclease activity upon target recognition.

Gcorn Plant: A Database for Retrieving Functional and Evolutionary Traits of Plant Genes

Extracellular ATP Shapes a Defense-Related Transcriptome Both Independently and along with Other Defense Signaling Pathways
<p>ATP is not only an essential metabolite of cellular biochemistry but also acts as a signal in the extracellular milieu. In plants, extracellular ATP is monitored by the purinergic receptor P2K1. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular ATP acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern in plants, and its signaling through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various pathogenic microorganisms. Biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens attack plants using different strategies, to which plants respond accordingly with salicylate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d or jasmonate/ethylene-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d defensive signaling, respectively. Interestingly, defense mediated by P2K1 is effective against pathogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular ATP signaling and that of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. To address this issue, we analyzed ATP-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the signaling pathways of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate (classic defense hormones) as well as a mutant and an overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor. We found that P2K1 function is crucial for faithful ATP-induced transcriptional changes and that a subset of genes is more responsive in the P2K1 overexpression line. We also found that more than half of the ATP-responsive genes required signaling by one or more of the pathways for the classical defense hormones, with the jasmonate-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d signaling being more critical than others. By contrast, the other ATP-responsive genes were unaffected by deficiencies in signaling for any of the classical defense hormones. These ATP-responsive genes were highly enriched for defense-related Gene Ontology terms. We further tested the ATP-induced genes in knockout mutants of transcription factors, demonstrating that MYCs acting downstream of the jasmonate receptor complex and calmodulin-binding transcription activators are nuclear transducers of P2K1-mediated extracellular ATP signaling.</p>

<i>Foxtail mosaic virus</i>: A Viral Vector for Protein Expression in Cereals

In this vector, PV101, the gene of interest was inserted downstream of the duplicated subgenomic promoter of the viral coat protein gene, and the corresponding protein was expressed in its free form. The vector allowed the expression of a 239-amino acid-long GFP in both virus-inoculated and upper uninoculated (systemic) leaves of wheat and maize and directed the systemic expression of a larger approximately 600-amino acid protein, GUSPlus, in maize. Moreover, we demonstrated that PV101 can be used for in planta expression and functional analysis of apoplastic pathogen effector proteins such as the host-specific toxin ToxA of <i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i>. Therefore, this VOX vector opens possibilities for functional genomics studies in two important cereal crops.</p>

Time-Course Transcriptomics Analysis Reveals Key Responses of Submerged Deepwater Rice to Flooding
<p>Water submergence is an environmental factor that limits plant growth and survival. Deepwater rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) adapts to submergence by rapidly elongating its internodes and thereby maintaining its leaves above the water surface. We performed a comparative RNA sequencing transcriptome analysis of the shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> region, including basal nodes, internodes, and shoot apices of seedlings at two developmental stages from two varieties with contrasting deepwater growth responses. A transcriptomic comparison between deepwater rice cv C9285 and nondeepwater rice cv Taichung 65 revealed both similar and differential expression patterns between the two genotypes during submergence. The expression of genes related to gibberellin biosynthesis, trehalose biosynthesis, anaerobic fermentation, cell wall modification, and transcription factors that include ethylene-responsive factors was significantly different between the varieties. Interestingly, in both varieties, the jasmonic acid content at the shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> decreased during submergence, while exogenous jasmonic acid inhibited submergence-induced internode elongation in cv C9285, suggesting that jasmonic acid plays a role in the submergence response of rice. Furthermore, a targeted de novo transcript assembly revealed transcripts that were specific to cv C9285, including submergence-induced biotic stress-related genes. Our multifaceted transcriptome approach using the rice shoot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> region illustrates a differential response to submergence between deepwater and nondeepwater rice. Jasmonic acid metabolism appears to participate in the submergence-mediated internode elongation response of deepwater rice.</p>

A New Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus Allows Large Protein Overexpression for Rapid Function Analysis
<p>Understanding the genetic and molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>s of gene function is of increasing importance to harness their potential to produce plants with novel traits. One important objective is the improvement of plant productivity to meet future demands in food crop production. Gene function is mostly characterized through overexpression or silencing in transgenic plants. This approach is a lengthy procedure, especially in cereals. Plant viral expression systems can be used for rapid expression of proteins. However, current systems have a small cargo capacity and have mostly been used for gene silencing. Here, a four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d system with high cargo capacity was constructed for the rapid and stable expression of recombinant proteins in different plant species, allowing function analyses at different stages of development. Fluorescent marker proteins are expressed at high levels within 1 week, and a proof of efficient function analysis is shown using the aluminum malate transporter1 gene. In addition to the ability of gene cotransformation, this work demonstrates that the four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d system allows the overexpression of cDNAs of up to 2,100 nucleotides (encoding a protein of ∼78 kD), thereby providing an invaluable tool to accelerate functional genomics and proteomic research in monocot and dicot species.</p>

PaCeQuant: A Tool for High-Throughput Quantification of Pavement Cell Shape Characteristics
<p>Pavement cells (PCs) are the most frequently occurring cell type in the leaf epidermis and play important roles in leaf growth and function. In many plant species, PCs form highly complex jigsaw-puzzle-shaped cells with interlocking lobes. Understanding of their development is of high interest for plant science research because of their importance for leaf growth and hence for plant fitness and crop yield. Studies of PC development, however, are limited, because robust methods are lacking that enable automatic segmentation and quantification of PC shape parameters suitable to reflect their cellular complexity. Here, we present our new ImageJ-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d tool, PaCeQuant, which provides a fully automatic image analysis workflow for PC shape quantification. PaCeQuant automatically detects cell boundaries of PCs from confocal input images and enables manual correction of automatic segmentation results or direct import of manually segmented cells. PaCeQuant simultaneously extracts 27 shape features that include global, contour-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d, skeleton-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d, and PC-specific object descriptors. In addition, we included a method for classification and analysis of lobes at two-cell junctions and three-cell junctions, respectively. We provide an R script for graphical visualization and statistical analysis. We validated PaCeQuant by extensive comparative analysis to manual segmentation and existing quantification tools and demonstrated its usability to analyze PC shape characteristics during development and between different genotypes. PaCeQuant thus provides a platform for robust, efficient, and reproducible quantitative analysis of PC shape characteristics that can easily be applied to study PC development in large data sets.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic networks can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, reconstructing such networks is not trivial. Popular character-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d methods cannot guarantee reconstruction accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d method to construct a phylogenetic network from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic network. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in reconstructing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic network construction methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in constructing phylogenetic networks from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

Conventional Versus Compression-Only Versus No-Bystander Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (chest compression and rescue breathing) has been recommended for pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) because of the asphyxial nature of the majority of pediatric cardiac arrest events. However, the clinical effectiveness of additional rescue breathing (conventional CPR) compared with compression-only CPR in children is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This nationwide population-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d study of pediatric OHCA patients was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on data from the All-Japan Utstein Registry. We included all pediatric patients who experienced OHCA in Japan from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012. The primary outcome was a favorable neurological state 1 month after OHCA defined as a Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 to 2 (corresponding to a Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score of 1–3). Outcomes were compared with logistic regression with uni- and multivariable modeling in the overall cohort and for a propensity-matched subset of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 2157 patients were included; 417 received conventional CPR, 733 received compression-only CPR, and 1007 did not receive any bystander CPR. Among these patients, 213 (9.9%) survived with a favorable neurological status 1 month after OHCA, including 108/417 (25.9%) for conventional, 68/733 (9.3%) for compression-only, and 37/1007 (3.7%) for no-bystander CPR. In unadjusted analyses, conventional CPR was superior to compression-only CPR in neurologically favorable survival (odds ratio [OR] 3.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.45–4.76; <i>P</i><0.0001), with a trend favoring conventional CPR that was no longer statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 1.52, 95% CI 0.93–2.49), and with further attenuation of the difference in a propensity-matched subset (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.81–1.77). Both conventional and compression-only CPR were associated with higher odds for neurologically favorable survival compared with no-bystander CPR (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 5.01, 95% CI 2.98–8.57, and OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 3.29, 95% CI 1.93–5.71), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this population-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d study of pediatric OHCA in Japan, both conventional and compression-only CPR were associated with superior outcomes compared with no-bystander CPR. Unadjusted outcomes with conventional CPR were superior to compression-only CPR, with the magnitude of difference attenuated and no longer statistically significant after statistical adjustments. These findings support randomized clinical trials comparing conventional versus compression-only CPR in children, with conventional CPR preferred until such controlled comparative data are available, and either method preferred over no-bystander CPR.</p></sec>

Lipidomics Profiling and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in the Prospective Population-Based Bruneck Study
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The bulk of cardiovascular disease risk is not explained by traditional risk factors. Recent advances in mass spectrometry allow the identification and quantification of hundreds of lipid species. Molecular lipid profiling by mass spectrometry may improve cardiovascular risk prediction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Lipids were extracted from 685 plasma samples of the prospective population-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d Bruneck Study (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>line evaluation in 2000). One hundred thirty-five lipid species from 8 different lipid classes were profiled by shotgun lipidomics with the use of a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Levels of individual species of cholesterol esters (CEs), lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), sphingomyelins, and triacylglycerols (TAGs) were associated with cardiovascular disease over a 10-year observation period (2000–2010, 90 incident events). Among the lipid species with the strongest predictive value were TAGs and CEs with a low carbon number and double-bond content, including TAG(54:2) and CE(16:1), as well as PE(36:5) (<i>P</i>=5.1×10<sup>−7</sup>, 2.2×10<sup>−4</sup>, and 2.5×10<sup>−3</sup>, respectively). Consideration of these 3 lipid species on top of traditional risk factors resulted in improved risk discrimination and classification for cardiovascular disease (cross-validated ΔC index, 0.0210 [95% confidence interval, 0.0010-0.0422]; integrated discrimination improvement, 0.0212 [95% confidence interval, 0.0031-0.0406]; and continuous net reclassification index, 0.398 [95% confidence interval, 0.175-0.619]).

Evaluating Topological Conflict in Centipede Phylogeny Using Transcriptomic Data Sets
<p>Relationships between the five extant orders of centipedes have been considered solved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on morphology. Phylogenies <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on samples of up to a few dozen genes have largely been congruent with the morphological tree apart from an alternative placement of one order, the relictual Craterostigmomorpha, consisting of two species in Tasmania and New Zealand. To address this incongruence, novel transcriptomic data were generated to sample all five orders of centipedes and also used as a test case for studying gene-tree incongruence. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian mixture model analyses of a data set composed of 1,934 orthologs with 45% missing data, as well as the 389 orthologs in the least saturated, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">station</span></strong>ary quartile, retrieve strong support for a sister-group relationship between Craterostigmomorpha and all other pleurostigmophoran centipedes, of which the latter group is newly named Amalpighiata. The Amalpighiata hypothesis, which shows little gene-tree incongruence and is robust to the influence of among-taxon compositional heterogeneity, implies convergent evolution in several morphological and behavioral characters traditionally used in centipede phylogenetics, such as maternal brood care, but accords with patterns of first appearances in the fossil record.</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural selection, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural selection on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. It obtains information about divergence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on summary statistics describing polymorphism and divergence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.</p>

Sequential Duplications of an Ancient Member of the DnaJ-Family Expanded the Functional Chaperone Network in the Eukaryotic Cytosol
<p>Across eukaryotes, Hsp70-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d chaperone machineries display an underlying unity in their sequence, structure, and biochemical mechanism of action, while working in a myriad of cellular processes. In good part, this extraordinary functional versatility is derived from the ability of a single Hsp70 to interact with an array of J-protein cochaperones to form a functional chaperone network. Among J-proteins, the DnaJ-type is the most prevalent, being present in all three kingdoms and in several different compartments of eukaryotic cells. However, because these ancient DnaJ-type proteins diverged at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong> of the eukaryotic phylogeny, little is understood about the evolutionary basis of their diversification and thus the functional expansion of the chaperone network. Here, we report results of evolutionary and experimental analyses of two more recent members of the cytosolic DnaJ family of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Xdj1 and Apj1, which emerged by sequential duplications of the ancient <i>YDJ1</i> in Ascomycota. Sequence comparison and molecular modeling revealed that both Xdj1 and Apj1 maintained a domain organization similar to that of multifunctional Ydj1. However, despite these similarities, both Xdj1 and Apj1 evolved highly specialized functions. Xdj1 plays a unique role in the translocation of proteins from the cytosol into mitochondria. Apj1’s specialized role is related to degradation of sumolyated proteins. Together these data provide the first clear example of cochaperone duplicates that evolved specialized functions, allowing expansion of the chaperone functional network, while maintaining the overall structural organization of their parental gene.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Antioxidants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as antioxidants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are minor antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies
<p>Life experiences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether differences in experience could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking males that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social experience and physical environment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> males are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local environment. Although dominant males are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on experience. We hypothesized that as males mature they might hone their fighting tactics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on observation of other males fighting. We compared males of different ages and sizes in distinctly different physical environments and subsequently tested their fighting skills. We found that a size difference previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing environmental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that males only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that experience is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant experience than the physical complexity of the territory.</p>

Octopaminergic modulation of the visual flight speed regulator of <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that flies' sensitivity to large-field optic flow is increased by the release of octopamine during flight. This increase in gain presumably enhances visually mediated behaviors such as the active regulation of forward speed, a process that involves the comparison of a vision-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d estimate of velocity with an internal set point. To determine where in the neural circuit this comparison is made, we selectively silenced the octopamine neurons in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i>, and examined the effect on vision-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d velocity regulation in free-flying flies. We found that flies with inactivated octopamine neurons accelerated more slowly in response to visual motion than control flies, but maintained nearly the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>line flight speed. Our results are parsimonious with a circuit architecture in which the internal control signal is injected into the visual motion pathway upstream of the interneuron network that estimates groundspeed.</p>

Gene Capture Coupled to High-Throughput Sequencing as a Strategy for Targeted Metagenome Exploration
<p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows faster acquisition of metagenomic data, but complete exploration of complex ecosystems is hindered by the extraordinary diversity of microorganisms. To reduce the environmental complexity, we created an innovative solution hybrid selection (SHS) method that is combined with NGS to characterize large DNA fragments harbouring biomarkers of interest. The quality of enrichment was evaluated after fragments containing the methyl coenzyme M reductase subunit A gene (<i>mcrA</i>), the biomarker of methanogenesis, were captured from a <i>Methanosarcina</i> strain and a metagenomic sample from a meromictic lake. The methanogen diversity was compared with direct metagenome and <i>mcrA</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d amplicon pyrosequencing strategies<i>.</i> The SHS approach resulted in the capture of DNA fragments up to 2.5 kb with an enrichment efficiency between 41 and 100%, depending on the sample complexity. Compared with direct metagenome and amplicons sequencing, SHS detected broader <i>mcrA</i> diversity, and it allowed efficient sampling of the rare biosphere and unknown sequences. In contrast to amplicon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d strategies, SHS is less biased and GC independent, and it recovered complete biomarker sequences in addition to conserved regions. Because this method can also isolate the regions flanking the target sequences, it could facilitate operon reconstructions.</p>

Motor neurons and glia exhibit specific individualized responses to TDP-43 expression in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by complex neuronal and glial phenotypes. Recently, RNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d mechanisms have been linked to ALS via RNA-binding proteins such as TDP-43, which has been studied <i>in vivo</i> using models ranging from yeast to rodents. We have developed a <i>Drosophila</i> model of ALS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on TDP-43 that recapitulates several aspects of pathology, including motor neuron loss, locomotor dysfunction and reduced survival. Here we report the phenotypic consequences of expressing wild-type and four different ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations in neurons and glia. We show that TDP-43-driven neurodegeneration phenotypes are dose- and age-dependent. In motor neurons, TDP-43 appears restricted to nuclei, which are significantly misshapen due to mutant but not wild-type protein expression. In glia and in the developing neuroepithelium, TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic puncta. TDP-43-containing RNA granules are motile in cultured motor neurons, although wild-type and mutant variants exhibit different kinetic properties. At the neuromuscular junction, the expression of TDP-43 in motor neurons versus glia leads to seemingly opposite synaptic phenotypes that, surprisingly, translate into comparable locomotor defects. Finally, we explore sleep as a behavioral readout of TDP-43 expression and find evidence of sleep fragmentation consistent with hyperexcitability, a suggested mechanism in ALS. These findings support the notion that although motor neurons and glia are both involved in ALS pathology, at the cellular level they can exhibit different responses to TDP-43. In addition, our data suggest that individual TDP-43 alleles utilize distinct molecular mechanisms, which will be important for developing therapeutic strategies.</p>

Development
Non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> embryos
<p>Insect development has contributed significantly to our understanding of metazoan development. However, most information has been obtained by analyzing a single species, the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Embryonic development of the red flour beetle <i>Tribolium castaneum</i> differs fundamentally from that of <i>Drosophila</i> in aspects such as short-germ development, embryonic leg development, extensive extra-embryonic membrane formation and non-involuted head development. Although <i>Tribolium</i> has become the second most important insect model organism, previous live imaging attempts have addressed only specific questions and no long-term live imaging data of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis have been available. By combining light sheet-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d fluorescence microscopy with a novel mounting method, we achieved complete, continuous and non-invasive fluorescence live imaging of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis at high spatiotemporal resolution. The embryos survived the 2-day or longer imaging process, developed into adults and produced fertile progeny. Our data document all morphogenetic processes from the rearrangement of the uniform blastoderm to the onset of regular muscular movement in the same embryo and in four orientations, contributing significantly to the understanding of <i>Tribolium</i> development. Furthermore, we created a comprehensive chronological table of <i>Tribolium</i> embryogenesis, integrating most previous work and providing a reference for future studies. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on our observations, we provide evidence that serosa window closure and serosa opening, although deferred by more than 1 day, are linked. All our long-term imaging datasets are available as a resource for the community. <i>Tribolium</i> is only the second insect species, after <i>Drosophila</i>, for which non-invasive long-term fluorescence live imaging has been achieved.</p>

Development
Limited predictive value of blastomere angle of division in trophectoderm and inner cell mass specification
<p>The formation of trophectoderm (TE) and pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) is one of the earliest events during mammalian embryogenesis. It is believed that the orientation of division of polarised blastomeres in the 8- and 16-cell stage embryo determines the fate of daughter cells, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on how asymmetrically distributed lineage determinants are segregated. To investigate the relationship between angle of division and subsequent fate in unperturbed embryos, we constructed cellular resolution digital representations of the development of mouse embryos from the morula to early blastocyst stage, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">base</span></strong>d on 4D confocal image volumes. We find that at the 16-cell stage, very few inside cells are initially produced as a result of cell division, but that the number increases due to cell movement. Contrary to expectations, outside cells at the 16-cell stage represent a heterogeneous population, with some fated to contributing exclusively to the TE and others capable of contributing to both the TE and ICM. Our data support the view that factors other than the angle of division, such as the position of a blastomere, play a major role in the specification of TE and ICM.</p>

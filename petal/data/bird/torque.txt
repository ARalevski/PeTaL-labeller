Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   alignment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es during static and dynamic weight-bearing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moment</span></strong>s were measured in nine   patients with instrumented knee implants. Medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratios were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend). Hip-knee-ankle angles in the frontal plane were analysed   using full-leg coronal radiographs. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratio strongly correlated with the tibiofemoral   alignment in the static condition of one-legged stance (R² = 0.88)   and dynamic single-limb loading (R² = 0.59) with varus malalignment   leading to increased medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratios of up to 88%. In contrast,   the correlation between leg alignment and magnitude of medial compartment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e   was much less pronounced. A lateral shift of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e occurred during   activities with double-limb support and higher knee flexion angles. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratio depends on both the tibiofemoral alignment   and the nature of the activity involved. It cannot be generalised   to a single value. Higher medial ratios during single-limb loading   are associated with varus malalignment in TKA. The current trend   towards a ‘constitutional varus’ after joint replacement, in terms   of overall tibiofemoral alignment, should be considered carefully   with respect to the increased medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e ratio.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:779–87.</p></sec>

Profiling the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force in B cell activation
<p>B lymphocytes use B cell receptors (BCRs) to recognize membrane-bound antigens to further initiate cell spreading and contraction responses during B cell activation. We combined traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e microscopy and live-cell imaging to profile the origin, dynamics, and function of traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation in these responses. We showed that B cell activation required the generation of 10 to 20 nN of traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e when encountering antigens presented by substrates with stiffness values from 0.5 to 1 kPa, which mimic the rigidity of antigen-presenting cells in vivo. Perturbation experiments revealed that F-actin remodeling and myosin- and dynein-mediated contractility contributed to traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation and B cell activation. Moreover, membrane-proximal BCR signaling molecules (including Lyn, Syk, Btk, PLC-γ2, BLNK, and Vav3) and adaptor molecules (Grb2, Cbl, and Dok-3) linking BCR microclusters and motor proteins were also required for the sustained generation of these traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es. We found a positive correlation between the strength of the traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e and the mean fluorescence intensity of the BCR microclusters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that isotype-switched memory B cells expressing immunoglobulin G (IgG)–BCRs generated greater traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es than did mature naive B cells expressing IgM-BCRs during B cell activation. Last, we observed that primary B cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis generated greater traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es than did B cells from healthy donors in response to antigen stimulation. Together, these data delineate the origin, dynamics, and function of traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e during B cell activation.</p>

Do varus or valgus outliers have higher forces in the medial or lateral compartments than those which are in-range after a kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of patients   with outlier varus or valgus alignment in kinematically aligned   total knee arthroplasty (TKA), whether those with outlier varus   or valgus alignment have higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es in the medial or lateral   compartments of the knee than those with in-range alignment and   whether measurements of the alignment of the limb, knee and components   predict compartment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The intra-operative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es in the medial and lateral compartments   were measured with an instrumented tibial insert in 67 patients   who underwent a kinematically aligned TKA during passive movement.

Measurements   of the alignment of the limb and the components included the hip-knee-ankle   (HKA) angle, proximal medial tibial angle (PMTA), and distal lateral   femoral angle (DLFA). Measurements of the alignment of the knee   and the components included the tibiofemoral angle (TFA), tibial   component angle (TCA) and femoral component angle (FCA).

Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p>Cell motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and cancer cell invasion. It is generally thought that migrating cells grab and exert traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e onto the extracellular matrix in order to pull the cell body forward. While previous studies have shown that myosin II deficient cells migrate efficiently, whether these cells exert traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es during cell migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e sensor and shRNA specific to each myosin II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how myosin IIA and IIB individually regulate cell migration and traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation. Myosin IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual myosin II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, myosin IIA deficient cells lost actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas myosin IIB deficient cells maintained similar actin organization and focal adhesions as wild-type cells. Interestingly, myosin IIA deficient cells migrated faster than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet myosin IIA deficient cells exerted significantly less traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e at the leading edge than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells. These results suggest that, in the absence of myosin IIA mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-generating machinery, cells move with minimal traction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es at the cell periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of cells to adapt and migrate.</p>

The functional role of caudal and anal/dorsal fins during the C-start of a bluegill sunfish
<p>Fast starts are crucial in the survival of aquatic swimmers to capture prey or avoid predators. Currently, it is widely accepted that during C-starts: (1) the caudal fin generates a considerable hydrodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e; and (2) anal/dorsal fins are erected to significantly increase the hydrodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e. In this work, the above hypotheses on the role of fins during C-starts are studied using experimentally guided numerical simulations of four bluegill sunfish, whose fins are removed or erected. The amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e created by the body and fins at each time instant was not constant and varied during the C-start. Nevertheless, in agreement with hypothesis (1), up to 70% of the instantaneous hydrodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was generated by the tail during Stage 2 of the C-start, when the sunfish rapidly bends out of the C-shape. Additionally, the contribution in Stage 1, when the sunfish bends into a C-shape, is less than 20% at each instant. Most of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e in Stage 1 was produced by the body of the sunfish. In contrast to hypothesis (2), the effect of erection/removal of the fins was less than 5% of the instantaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e in both Stages 1 and 2, except for a short period of time (2 ms) just before Stage 2. However, it is known that the anal/dorsal fins are actively controlled during the C-start from muscle activity measurements. Based on the results presented here, it is suggested that the active control of the anal/dorsal fins can be related to retaining the stability of the sunfish against roll and pitch movements during the C-start. Furthermore, the erection of the fins increases the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moment</span></strong> of inertia to make the roll and pitch movements more difficult.</p>

Twistable electronics with dynamically rotatable heterostructures
<p>In heterostructures of two-dimensional materials, electronic properties can vary dramatically with relative interlayer angle. This effect makes it theoretically possible to realize a new class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong>able electronics in which properties can be manipulated on demand by means of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion. We demonstrate a device architecture in which a layered heterostructure can be dynamically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong>ed in situ. We study graphene encapsulated by boron nitride, where, at small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion angles, the device characteristics are dominated by coupling to a long-wavelength moirééé superlattice. The ability to investigate arbitrary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion angle in a single device reveals features of the optical, mechanical, and electronic response in this system not captured in static <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion studies. Our results establish the capability to fabricate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong>able electronic devices with dynamically tunable properties.</p>

Molecular mechanism of extreme mechanostability in a pathogen adhesin
<p>High resilience to mechanical stress is key when pathogens adhere to their target and initiate infection. Using atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e microscopy–based single-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e spectroscopy, we explored the mechanical stability of the prototypical staphylococcal adhesin SdrG, which targets a short peptide from human fibrinogen β. Steered molecular dynamics simulations revealed, and single-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e spectroscopy experiments confirmed, the mechanism by which this complex withstands <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es of over 2 nanonewtons, a regime previously associated with the strength of a covalent bond. The target peptide, confined in a screwlike manner in the binding pocket of SdrG, distributes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es mainly toward the peptide backbone through an intricate hydrogen bond network. Thus, these adhesins can attach to their target with exceptionally resilient mechanostability, virtually independent of peptide side chains.</p>

Vinculin forms a directionally asymmetric catch bond with F-actin
<p>Vinculin is an actin-binding protein thought to rein<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. However, how mechanical load affects the vinculin–F-actin bond is unclear. Using a single-molecule optical trap assay, we found that vinculin forms a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-dependent catch bond with F-actin through its tail domain, but with lifetimes that depend strongly on the direction of the applied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e toward the pointed (–) end of the actin filament resulted in a bond that was maximally stable at 8 piconewtons, with a mean lifetime (12 seconds) 10 times as long as the mean lifetime when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was applied toward the barbed (+) end. A computational model of lamellipodial actin dynamics suggests that the directionality of the vinculin–F-actin bond could establish long-range order in the actin cytoskeleton. The directional and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-stabilized binding of vinculin to F-actin may be a mechanism by which adhesion complexes maintain front-rear asymmetry in migrating cells.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program.

We evaluated the femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau.

Tuning superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene
<p>Materials with flat electronic bands often exhibit exotic quantum phenomena owing to strong correlations. An isolated low-energy flat band can be induced in bilayer graphene by simply <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ing the layers by 1.1°, resulting in the appearance of gate-tunable superconducting and correlated insulating phases. In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong> angle, the interlayer coupling can be varied to precisely tune these phases. We induce superconductivity at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong> angle larger than 1.1°—in which correlated phases are otherwise absent—by varying the interlayer spacing with hydrostatic pressure. Our low-disorder devices reveal details about the superconducting phase diagram and its relationship to the nearby insulator. Our results demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong>ed bilayer graphene to be a distinctively tunable platform for exploring correlated states.</p>

A dodecagonal quasicrystalline order was realized by epitaxial growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong>ed bilayer graphene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ed exactly 30°. We grew the graphene quasicrystal up to a millimeter scale on a silicon carbide surface while maintaining the single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion angle over an entire sample and successfully isolated the quasicrystal from a substrate, demonstrating its structural and chemical stability under ambient conditions. Multiple Dirac cones replicated with the 12-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional symmetry were observed in angle-resolved photoemission spectra, which revealed anomalous strong interlayer coupling with quasi-periodicity. Our study provides a way to explore physical properties of relativistic fermions with controllable quasicrystalline orders.</p>

Imaging rotational dynamics of nanoparticles in liquid by 4D electron microscopy
<p>In real time and space, four-dimensional electron microscopy (4D EM) has enabled observation of transient structures and morphologies of inorganic and organic materials. We have extended 4D EM to include liquid cells without the time resolution being limited by the response of the detector. Our approach permits the imaging of the motion and morphological dynamics of a single, same particle on nanometer and ultrashort time scales. As a first application, we studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional dynamics of gold nanoparticles in aqueous solution. A full transition from the conventional diffusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion to superdiffusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and further to a ballistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion was observed with increasing asymmetry of the nanoparticle morphology. We explored the underlying physics both experimentally and theoretically according to the morphological asymmetry of the nanoparticles.</p>

Arthroscopic decompression not recommended in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tendinopathy has a multifactorial origin. Rejecting   the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning operative treatment   at initial presentation in the first line. Physiotherapy exercise   programmes are the accepted first line treatment. The aim of this   study was to assess the long-term additional benefits of subacromial decompression   in the treatment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tendinopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This randomised controlled trial of 140 patients (52 men, 88   women, mean age 47.1 years; 18 to 60) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tendinopathy   extended previous work up to a maximum of 13 years. The patients   were randomised into two treatment groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty   and a supervised exercise treatment and a similar supervised exercise   treatment alone. Self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS)   was the primary outcome measure. Secondary measures were disability,   working ability, pain at night, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire   score and the number of painful days during the three months preceding   the final assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 90 patients (64%) returned questionnaires at a mean   12 years after randomisation. On an intention-to-treat basis, both   treatment groups reached statistically significant improvement compared   with the initial VAS for pain, but there was no significant difference   between groups. The same was true in the secondary outcome measures.   Due to group changes, the results were also analysed per protocol:   operated or not.

Mechanical Stress Conditioning and Electrical Stimulation Promote Contractility and Force Maturation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Human Cardiac Tissue
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Tissue engineering enables the generation of functional human cardiac tissue with cells derived in vitro in combination with biocompatible materials. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes provide a cell source for cardiac tissue engineering; however, their immaturity limits their potential applications. Here we sought to study the effect of mechanical conditioning and electric pacing on the maturation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells were used to generate collagen-based bioengineered human cardiac tissue. Engineered tissue constructs were subjected to different mechanical stress and electric pacing conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The engineered human myocardium exhibits Frank-Starling–type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-length relationships. After 2 weeks of static stress conditioning, the engineered myocardium demonstrated increases in contractility (0.63±0.10 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 0.055±0.009 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> for no stress), tensile stiffness, construct alignment, and cell size. Stress conditioning also increased SERCA2 (Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase 2) expression, which correlated with a less negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-frequency relationship. When electric pacing was combined with static stress conditioning, the tissues showed an additional increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e production (1.34±0.19 mN/mm<sup>2</sup>), with no change in construct alignment or cell size, suggesting maturation of excitation-contraction coupling. Supporting this notion, we found expression of RYR2 (Ryanodine Receptor 2) and SERCA2 further increased by combined static stress and electric stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These studies demonstrate that electric pacing and mechanical stimulation promote maturation of the structural, mechanical, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e generation properties of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues.</p></sec>

Photonic crystals for nano-light in moiré graphene superlattices
<p>Graphene is an atomically thin plasmonic medium that supports highly confined plasmon polaritons, or nano-light, with very low loss. Electronic properties of graphene can be drastically altered when it is laid upon another graphene layer, resulting in a moiré superlattice. The relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong> angle between the two layers is a key tuning parameter of the interlayer coupling in thus-obtained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong>ed bilayer graphene (TBG). We studied the propagation of plasmon polaritons in TBG by infrared nano-imaging. We discovered that the atomic reconstruction occurring at small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong> angles transforms the TBG into a natural plasmon photonic crystal for propagating nano-light. This discovery points to a pathway for controlling nano-light by exploiting quantum properties of graphene and other atomically layered van der Waals materials, eliminating the need for arduous top-down nanofabrication.</p>

Key-and-lock commodity self-healing copolymers
<p>Self-healing materials are notable for their ability to recover from physical or chemical damage. We report that commodity copolymers, such as poly(methyl methacrylate)/n-butyl acrylate [p(MMA/nBA)] and their derivatives, can self-heal upon mechanical damage. This behavior occurs in a narrow compositional range for copolymer topologies that are preferentially alternating with a random component (alternating/random) and is attributed to favorable interchain van der Waals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es forming key-and-lock interchain junctions. The use of van der Waals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es instead of supramolecular or covalent rebonding or encapsulated reactants eliminates chemical and physical alterations and enables multiple recovery upon mechanical damage without external intervention. Unlike other self-healing approaches, perturbation of ubiquitous van der Waals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es upon mechanical damage is energetically unfavorable for interdigitated alternating/random copolymer motifs that facilitate self-healing under ambient conditions.</p>

Torsional instability in the single-chain limit of a transition metal trichalcogenide
<p>The scientific bounty resulting from the successful isolation of few to single layers of two-dimensional materials suggests that related new physics resides in the few- to single-chain limit of one-dimensional materials. We report the synthesis of the quasi–one-dimensional transition metal trichalcogenide NbSe<sub>3</sub> (niobium triselenide) in the few-chain limit, including the realization of isolated single chains. The chains are encapsulated in protective boron nitride or carbon nanotube sheaths to prevent oxidation and to facilitate characterization. Transmission electron microscopy reveals static and dynamic structural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">torsion</span></strong>al waves not found in bulk NbSe<sub>3</sub> crystals. Electronic structure calculations indicate that charge transfer drives the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">torsion</span></strong>al wave instability. Very little covalent bonding is found between the chains and the nanotube sheath, leading to relatively unhindered longitudinal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">torsion</span></strong>al dynamics for the encapsulated chains.</p>

Structure, mechanism, and regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase
<p>The chloroplast adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase uses the electrochemical proton gradient generated by photosynthesis to produce ATP, the energy currency of all cells. Protons conducted through the membrane-embedded F<sub>o</sub> motor drive ATP synthesis in the F<sub>1</sub> head by rotary catalysis. We determined the high-resolution structure of the complete cF<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> complex by cryo–electron microscopy, resolving side chains of all 26 protein subunits, the five nucleotides in the F<sub>1</sub> head, and the proton pathway to and from the rotor ring. The flexible peripheral stalk redistributes differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">torsion</span></strong>al energy across three unequal steps in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion cycle. Plant ATP synthase is autoinhibited by a β-hairpin redox switch in subunit γ that blocks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion in the dark.</p>

We used single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain structures of the full complex in a lipid bilayer in the absence or presence of the inhibitor oligomycin at 3.6- and 3.8-angstrom resolution, respectively. To limit conformational heterogeneity, we locked the rotor in a single conformation by fusing the F6 subunit of the stator with the δ subunit of the rotor. Assembly of the enzyme with the F6-δ fusion caused a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong>ing of the rotor and a 9° <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion of the F<sub>o</sub> c<sub>10</sub>-ring in the direction of ATP synthesis, relative to the structure of isolated F<sub>o</sub>.

Three-dimensional mechanical metamaterials with a twist
<p>Rationally designed artificial materials enable mechanical properties that are inaccessible with ordinary materials. Pushing on an ordinary linearly elastic bar can cause it to be deformed in many ways. However, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong>, the counterpart of optical activity in the static case, is strictly zero. The unavailability of this degree of freedom hinders applications in terms of mode conversion and the realization of advanced mechanical designs using coordinate transformations. Here, we aim at realizing microstructured three-dimensional elastic chiral mechanical metamaterials that overcome this limitation. On overall millimeter-sized samples, we measure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong>s per axial strain exceeding 2°/%. Scaling up the number of unit cells for fixed sample dimensions, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong> is robust due to metamaterial stiffening, indicating a characteristic length scale and bringing the aforementioned applications into reach.</p>

Quantum control of molecular collisions at 1 kelvin
<p>Measurement of vector correlations in molecular scattering is an indispensable tool for mapping out interaction potentials. In a coexpanded supersonic beam, we have studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ionally inelastic process wherein deuterium hydride (HD) (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) collides with molecular deuterium (D<sub>2</sub>) to form HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 1), where <i>v</i> and <i>j</i> are the vibrational and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional quantum numbers, respectively. HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) was prepared by Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage, with its bond axis aligned preferentially parallel or perpendicular to the lab-fixed relative velocity. The coexpansion brought the collision temperature down to 1 kelvin, restricting scattering to s and p partial waves. Scattering angular distributions showed a dramatic stereodynamic preference (~3:1) for perpendicular versus parallel alignment. The four-vector correlation measured between the initial and final velocities and the initial and final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional angular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moment</span></strong>um vectors of HD provides insight into the strong anisotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es present in the collision process.</p>

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The magnetic fields of solar-type stars are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun.

We have performed a set of turbulent global simulations that exhibit magnetic cycles varying systematically with stellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and luminosity. We find that the magnetic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion on turbulent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type stars.</p>

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals dispersion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

Emergence of hierarchical structural complexities in nanoparticles and their assembly

Single-stranded DNA sections of an origami structure acted as entropic springs and exerted controlled tension in the low piconewton range on a molecular system, whose conformational transitions were monitored by single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer. We used the conformer switching of a Holliday junction as a benchmark and studied the TATA-binding protein–induced bending of a DNA duplex under tension. The observed suppression of bending above 10 piconewtons provides further evidence of mechanosensitivity in gene regulation.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Division Plane Orientation Defects Revealed by a Synthetic Double Mutant Phenotype
<p>TANGLED1 (TAN1) and AUXIN-INDUCED-IN-ROOTS9 (AIR9) are microtubule-binding proteins that localize to the division site in plants. Their function in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) remained unclear because neither <i>tan1</i> nor <i>air9</i> single mutants have a strong phenotype. We show that <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutants have a synthetic phenotype consisting of short, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong>ed roots with disordered cortical microtubule arrays that are hypersensitive to a microtubule-depolymerizing drug. The <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutants have significant defects in division plane orientation due to failures in placing the new cell wall at the correct division site. Full-length TAN1 fused to yellow fluorescent protein, <i>TAN1-YFP</i>, and several deletion constructs were transformed into the double mutant to assess which regions of TAN1 are required for its function in root growth, root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong>ing, and division plane orientation. <i>TAN1-YFP</i> expressed in <i>tan1 air9</i> significantly rescued the double mutant phenotype in all three respects. Interestingly, TAN1 missing the first 126 amino acids, TAN1-ΔI-YFP, failed to rescue the double mutant phenotype, while TAN1 missing a conserved middle region, TAN1-ΔII-YFP, significantly rescued the mutant phenotype in terms of root growth and division plane orientation but not root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">twist</span></strong>ing. We use the <i>tan1 air9</i> double mutant to discover new functions for TAN1 and AIR9 during phragmoplast guidance and root morphogenesis.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es for effective flight control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

The diagnostic performance of radiographic criteria to detect aseptic acetabular component loosening after revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of radiographic   criteria to detect aseptic acetabular loosening after revision total   hip arthroplasty (THA). Secondary aims were to determine the predictive   values of different thresholds of migration and to determine the   predictive values of radiolucency criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Acetabular component migration to re-revision was measured retrospectively   using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup) and manual measurements   (Sutherland method) in two groups: Group A, 52 components (48 patients) found   not loose at re-revision and Group B, 42 components (36 patients)   found loose at re-revision between 1980 and 2015. The presence and   extent of radiolucent lines was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using EBRA, both proximal translation and sagittal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion were   excellent diagnostic tests for detecting aseptic loosening. The   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was   0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The thresholds of 2.5 mm proximal translation   or 2° sagittal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion (EBRA) in combination with radiolucency   criteria had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88% to detect   aseptic loosening. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive   value and negative predictive value (NPV) of radiolucency criteria   were 41%, 100%, 100% and 68% respectively. Manual measurements of   both proximal translation and sagittal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion were very good diagnostic tests.   The area under the ROC curve was 0.86 and 0.92 respectively. However,   manual measurements had a decreased specificity compared with EBRA.   Radiolucency criteria had a poor sensitivity and NPV of 41% and   68% respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that EBRA and manual migration measurements   can be used as accurate diagnostic tools to detect aseptic loosening   of cementless acetabular components used at revision THA. Radiolucency   criteria should not be used in isolation to exclude loosening of   cementless acetabular components used at revision THA given their poor   sensitivity and NPV.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:458–64.</p></sec>

Effectiveness of open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (UKUFF)
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The appropriate management for patients with a degenerative tear   of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff remains controversial, but operative treatment,   particularly arthroscopic surgery, is increasingly being used. Our   aim in this paper was to compare the effectiveness of arthroscopic   with open repair of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 273 patients were recruited to a randomised comparison   trial (136 to arthroscopic surgery and 137 to open surgery) from   19 teaching and general hospitals in the United Kingdom. The surgeons   used their usual preferred method of repair. The Oxford Shoulder   Score (OSS), two years post-operatively, was the primary outcome   measure. Imaging of the shoulder was performed at one year after   surgery. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials,   ISRCTN97804283.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean OSS improved from 26.3 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   8.2) at baseline, to 41.7 (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) two years post-operatively   for arthroscopic surgery and from 25.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 8.0) to 41.5   (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) for open surgery. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis   showed no statistical difference between the groups at two years   (difference in OSS score -0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75   to 1.22; p = 0.452). The confidence interval excluded the pre-determined   clinically important difference in the OSS of three points. The   rate of re-tear was not significantly different between the two groups   (46.4% for arthroscopic and 38.6% for open surgery; 95% CI -6.9   to 25.8; p = 0.256). Healed repairs had the most improved OSS.

Continuous distal migration and internal rotation of the C-stem prosthesis without any adverse clinical effects
<p>In 2005, we demonstrated that the polished triple-tapered   C-stem at two years had migrated distally and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ed internally.   From that series, 33 patients have now been followed radiologically,   clinically and by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) for up to ten   years. The distal migration within the cement mantle had continued   and reached a mean of 2 mm (0.5 to 4.0) at ten years. Internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion,   also within the cement mantle, was a mean 3.8° (external 1.6° to   internal 6.6°) The cement mantle did not show any sign of migration   or loosening in relation to the femoral bone. There were no clinical   or radiological signs indicating that the migration or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion   within the cement mantle had had any adverse effects for the patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:604–8.</p>

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have a far worse prognosis than those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). In the intact heart, SSc-PAH exhibits depressed rest and reserve right ventricular (RV) contractility compared with IPAH. We tested whether this disparity involves underlying differences in myofilament function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac myocytes were isolated from RV septal endomyocardial biopsies from patients with SSc-PAH, IPAH, or SSc with exertional dyspnea but no resting PAH (SSc-d); control RV septal tissue was obtained from nondiseased donor hearts (6–7 per group). Isolated myocyte passive length-tension and developed tension-calcium relationships were determined and correlated with in vivo RV function and reserve. RV septal fibrosis was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocyte passive stiffness from length-tension relations was similarly increased in IPAH and SSc-PAH compared with control, although SSc-PAH biopsies had more interstitial fibrosis. More striking disparities were found between active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e-calcium relations. Compared with controls, maximal calcium-activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e (F<sub>max</sub>) was 28% higher in IPAH but 37% lower in SSc-PAH. F<sub>max</sub> in SSc-d was intermediate between control and SSc-PAH. The calcium concentration required for half-maximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e (EC<sub>50</sub>) was similar between control, IPAH, and SSc-d but lower in SSc-PAH. This disparity disappeared in myocytes incubated with the active catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Myocyte F<sub>max</sub> directly correlated with in vivo RV contractility assessed by end-systolic elastance (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.46, <i>P</i>=0.002) and change in end-systolic elastance with exercise (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.49, <i>P</i>=0.008) and was inversely related with exercise-induced chamber dilation (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i>=0.63, <i>P</i><0.002), which also was a marker of depressed contractile reserve.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A primary defect in human SSc-PAH resides in depressed sarcomere function, whereas this is enhanced in IPAH. These disparities correlate with in vivo RV contractility and contractile reserve and are consistent with worse clinical outcomes in SSc-PAH. The existence of sarcomere disease before the development of resting PAH in patients with SSc-d suggests that earlier identification and intervention may prove useful.</p></sec>

History of winning remodels thalamo-PFC circuit to reinforce social dominance
<p>Mental strength and history of winning play an important role in the determination of social dominance. However, the neural circuits mediating these intrinsic and extrinsic factors have remained unclear. Working in mice, we identified a dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) neural population showing “effort”-related firing during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moment</span></strong>-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moment</span></strong> competition in the dominance tube test. Activation or inhibition of the dmPFC induces instant winning or losing, respectively. In vivo optogenetic-based long-term potentiation and depression experiments establish that the mediodorsal thalamic input to the dmPFC mediates long-lasting changes in the social dominance status that are affected by history of winning. The same neural circuit also underlies transfer of dominance between different social contests. These results provide a framework for understanding the circuit basis of adaptive and pathological social behaviors.</p>

Quantized electric multipole insulators
<p>The Berry phase provides a modern formulation of electric polarization in crystals. We extend this concept to higher electric multipole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moment</span></strong>s and determine the necessary conditions and minimal models for which the quadrupole and octupole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moment</span></strong>s are topologically quantized electromagnetic observables. Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional topological phases. Furthermore, they host topologically protected corner states carrying fractional charge, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating phases of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to topological invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this topological behavior that can be immediately tested. Our work opens a venue for the expansion of the classification of topological phases of matter.</p>

Structure, force balance, and topology of Earth’s magnetopause
<p>The magnetopause deflects the solar wind plasma and confines Earth’s magnetic field. We combine measurements made by the four spacecraft of the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission to demonstrate how the plasma and magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es at the boundary affect the interaction between the shocked solar wind and Earth’s magnetosphere. We compare these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es with the plasma pressure and examine the electron distribution function. We find that the magnetopause has sublayers with thickness comparable to the ion scale. Small pockets of low magnetic field strength, small radius of curvature, and high electric current mark the electron diffusion region. The flow of electrons, parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field, reveals a complex topology with the creation of magnetic ropes at the boundary.</p>

Greater role for Atlantic inflows on sea-ice loss in the Eurasian Basin of the Arctic Ocean
<p>Arctic sea-ice loss is a leading indicator of climate change and can be attributed, in large part, to atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>ing. Here, we show that recent ice reductions, weakening of the halocline, and shoaling of the intermediate-depth Atlantic Water layer in the eastern Eurasian Basin have increased winter ventilation in the ocean interior, making this region structurally similar to that of the western Eurasian Basin. The associated enhanced release of oceanic heat has reduced winter sea-ice formation at a rate now comparable to losses from atmospheric thermodynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>ing, thus explaining the recent reduction in sea-ice cover in the eastern Eurasian Basin. This encroaching “atlantification” of the Eurasian Basin represents an essential step toward a new Arctic climate state, with a substantially greater role for Atlantic inflows.</p>

Environmental and Genetic Factors Regulating Localization of the Plant Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase
<p>A P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is the primary transporter that converts ATP to electrochemical energy at the plasma membrane of higher plants. Its product, the proton-motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e, is composed of an electrical potential and a pH gradient. Many studies have demonstrated that this proton-motive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>e not only drives the secondary transporters required for nutrient uptake, but also plays a direct role in regulating cell expansion. Here, we have generated a transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plant expressing H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2) that is translationally fused with a fluorescent protein and examined its cellular localization by live-cell microscopy. Using a 3D imaging approach with seedlings grown for various times under a variety of light intensities, we demonstrate that AHA2 localization at the plasma membrane of root cells requires light. In dim light conditions, AHA2 is found in intracellular compartments, in addition to the plasma membrane. This localization profile was age-dependent and specific to cell types found in the transition zone located between the meristem and elongation zones. The accumulation of AHA2 in intracellular compartments is consistent with reduced H<sup>+</sup> secretion near the transition zone and the suppression of root growth. By examining AHA2 localization in a knockout mutant of a receptor protein kinase, FERONIA, we found that the intracellular accumulation of AHA2 in the transition zone is dependent on a functional FERONIA-dependent inhibitory response in root elongation. Overall, this study provides a molecular underpinning for understanding the genetic, environmental, and developmental factors influencing root growth via localization of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p>

Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its rigidity and structural integrity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose surfaces in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with minor motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold screw conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose surfaces but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold screw conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic surface compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forc</span></strong>es on the structural integrity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

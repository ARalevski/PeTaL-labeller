Nocebo effects can make you feel pain
<p>The mysterious phenomenon known as the nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> describes negative expectancies. This is in contrast to positive expectancies that trigger placebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s (<i>1</i>). In evolutionary terms, nocebo and placebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s coexist to favor perceptual mechanisms that anticipate threat and dangerous events (nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s) and promote appetitive and safety behaviors (placebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s). In randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, patients that receive placebos often report side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s (nocebos) that are similar to those experienced by patients that receive the investigational treatment (<i>2</i>). Information provided during the informed consent process and divulgence of adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s contribute to nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in clinical trials (<i>1</i>). Nocebo (and placebo) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s engage a complex set of neural circuits in the central nervous system that modulate the perception of touch, pressure, pain, and temperature (<i>1</i>, <i>3</i>, <i>4</i>). Commercial features of drugs such as price and labeling influence placebos (<i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). On page 105 of this issue, Tinnermann <i>et al.</i> (<i>7</i>) show that price also influences nocebo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s.</p>

Cost effectiveness of patellofemoral <i>versus</i> total knee arthroplasty in younger patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) has experienced significant   improvements in implant survivorship with second generation designs.   This has renewed interest in PFA as an alternative to total knee   arthroplasty (TKA) for younger active patients with isolated patellofemoral   osteoarthritis (PF OA). We analysed the cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness of PFA <i>versus</i> TKA   for the management of isolated PF OA in the United States-based   population.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used a Markov transition state model to compare cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness   between PFA and TKA. Simulated patients were aged 60 (base case)   and 50 years. Lifetime costs (2015 United States dollars), quality-adjusted   life year (QALY) gains and incremental cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness ratio   (ICER) were calculated from a healthcare payer perspective. Annual rates   of revision were derived from the National Joint Registry for England,   Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. Deterministic and probabilistic   sensitivity analysis was performed for all parameters against a   $50 000/QALY willingness to pay. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>PFA was more expensive ($49 811 <i>versus</i> $46 632)   but more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive (14.3 QALYs <i>versus</i> 13.3 QALYs)   over a lifetime horizon. The ICER associated with the additional   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness of PFA was $3097. The model was mainly sensitive to utility   values, with PFA remaining cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive when its utility exceeded   that of TKA by at least 1.0%. PFA provided incremental benefits   at no increased cost when annual rates of revision decreased by   24.5%. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Recent improvements in rates of implant of survival have made   PFA an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure in younger   patients, delaying TKA until implant failure or tibiofemoral OA   progression. The present study quantified the minimum required marginal   benefit for PFA to be cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive compared with TKA and identified survivorship   targets for PFA to become both less expensive and more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive.

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the risk of long-term side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s limit the success of existing therapeutic agents. Although Tspan12 has been shown to regulate retinal vascular development, nothing is known about its involvement in neovascular disease and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rodent models of retinal neovascular disease, including the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy and the very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model were analyzed for Tspan/β-catenin regulation. Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12. Therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the newly developed Ab on vascular endothelial cells were tested in vitro and in vivo in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The newly developed anti-Tspan12 Ab exhibited potent inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the Ab inhibited the interaction between Tspan12 and Frizzled-4 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ively modulates β-catenin levels and target genes in vascular endothelial cells. Tspan12/β-catenin signaling was activated in response to acute and chronic stress in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor mouse model of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal application of the Ab showed significant therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in both models without inducing negative side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on retina function. Moreover, combined intravitreal injection of the Ab with a known vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, Aflibercept, resulted in significant enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of each monotherapy. Combination therapy with the Tspan12 blocking antibody can be used to reduce anti-vascular endothelial growth factor doses, thus decreasing the risk of long-term off-target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tspan12/β-catenin signaling is critical for the progression of vasoproliferative disease. The newly developed anti-Tspan12 antibody has therapeutic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in vasoproliferative retinopathy and can enhance the potency of existing anti- vascular endothelial growth factor agents.</p></sec>

The Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Patients at Risk of Infective Endocarditis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended stopping antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for those at risk of infective endocarditis (IE) undergoing dental procedures in the United Kingdom, citing a lack of evidence of efficacy and cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness. We have performed a new economic evaluation of AP on the basis of contemporary estimates of efficacy, adverse events, and resource implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A decision analytic cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness model was used. Health service costs and benefits (measured as quality-adjusted life-years) were estimated. Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to estimate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>AP was less costly and more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive than no AP for all patients at risk of IE. The results are sensitive to AP efficacy, but efficacy would have to be substantially lower for AP not to be cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive. AP was even more cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive in patients at high risk of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk and 33 cases in all at-risk patients) would be required for AP to be considered cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Annual cost savings of £5.5 to £8.2 million ($7.3–$10.9 million) and health gains >2600 quality-adjusted life-years could be achieved from reinstating AP in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>AP is cost-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive for preventing IE, particularly in those at high risk.

Effect of Childhood Obesity Prevention Programs on Blood Pressure
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Childhood overweight and obesity are associated with elevated blood pressure (BP).

We assessed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of childhood obesity prevention programs on BP in children in developed countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We searched databases up to April 22, 2013, for relevant randomized, controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and natural experiments. Studies were included if they applied a diet or physical activity intervention(s) and were followed for ≥1 year (or ≥6 months for school-based intervention studies); they were excluded if they targeted only overweight/obese subjects or those with a medical condition. In our meta-analysis, intervention <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s were calculated for systolic BP and diastolic BP with the use of weighted random-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s models. Of the 23 included intervention studies (involving 18 925 participants), 21 involved a school setting. Our meta-analysis included 19 studies reporting on systolic BP and 18 on diastolic BP.

Intense threat switches dorsal raphe serotonin neurons to a paradoxical operational mode
<p>Survival depends on the selection of behaviors adaptive for the current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the sky. Although serotonin has been implicated in adaptive behavior, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that stimulation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments but induced escape behavior in high-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe serotonin neural dynamics inverted in high-threat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Stimulation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, and movement-related GABA neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. Thus, dorsal raphe circuits switch between distinct operational modes to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment-specific adaptive behaviors.</p>

The influence of human disturbance on wildlife nocturnality
<p>Rapid expansion of human activity has driven well-documented shifts in the spatial distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wildlif</span></strong>e, but the cumulative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of human disturbance on the temporal dynamics of animals has not been quantified. We examined anthropogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on mammal diel activity patterns, conducting a meta-analysis of 76 studies of 62 species from six continents. Our global study revealed a strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of humans on daily patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wildlif</span></strong>e activity. Animals increased their nocturnality by an average factor of 1.36 in response to human disturbance. This finding was consistent across continents, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s, taxa, and human activities. As the global human footprint expands, temporal avoidance of humans may facilitate human-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wildlif</span></strong>e coexistence. However, such responses can result in marked shifts away from natural patterns of activity, with consequences for fitness, population persistence, community interactions, and evolution.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature variations experienced in its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong> temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments.</p>

Potent Thrombolytic Effect of <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine on Arterial Thrombi
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Platelet cross-linking during arterial thrombosis involves von Willebrand Factor (VWF) multimers. Therefore, proteolysis of VWF appears promising to disaggregate platelet-rich thrombi and restore vessel patency in acute thrombotic disorders such as ischemic stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or acute limb ischemia. <i>N</i>-Acetylcysteine (NAC, a clinically approved mucolytic drug) can reduce intrachain disulfide bonds in large polymeric proteins. In the present study, we postulated that NAC might cleave the VWF multimers inside occlusive thrombi, thereby leading to their dissolution and arterial recanalization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Experimental models of thrombotic stroke induced by either intra-arterial thrombin injection or ferric chloride application followed by measurement of cerebral blood flow using a combination of laser Doppler flowmetry and MRI were performed to uncover the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of NAC on arterial thrombi. To investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of NAC on larger vessels, we also performed ferric chloride–induced carotid artery thrombosis. In vitro experiments were performed to study the molecular bases of NAC thrombolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>, including platelet aggregometry, platelet-rich thrombi lysis assays, thromboelastography (ROTEM), and high-shear VWF string formation using microfluidic devices. We also investigated the putative prohemorrhagic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of NAC in a mouse model of intracranial hemorrhage induced by in situ collagenase type VII injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We demonstrated that intravenous NAC administration promotes lysis of arterial thrombi that are resistant to conventional approaches such as recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, direct thrombin inhibitors, and antiplatelet treatments. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we provide evidence that the molecular target underlying the thrombolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of NAC is principally the VWF that cross-link platelets in arterial thrombi. Coadministration of NAC and a nonpeptidic GpIIb/IIIa inhibitor further improved its thrombolytic efficacy, essentially by accelerating thrombus dissolution and preventing rethrombosis. Thus, in a new large-vessel thromboembolic stroke model in mice, this cotreatment significantly improved ischemic lesion size and neurological outcome. It is important to note that NAC did not worsen hemorrhagic stroke outcome, suggesting that it exerts thrombolytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s without significantly impairing normal hemostasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We provide evidence that NAC is an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive and safe alternative to currently available antithrombotic agents to restore vessel patency after arterial occlusion.</p></sec>

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 Inhibits Neointima Formation by Engaging Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying neointima formation remain unclear. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are key innate immune regulators, play important roles in cardiometabolic diseases. However, the function of IRF4 in arterial restenosis is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>IRF4 expression was first detected in human and mouse restenotic arteries. Then, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of IRF4 on neointima formation were evaluated with universal IRF4-deficient mouse and rat carotid artery injury models. We performed immunostaining to identify IRF4-expressing cells in the lesions. Smooth muscle cell (SMC)–specific IRF4-knockout (KO) and -transgenic (TG) mice were generated to evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of SMC-IRF4 on neointima formation. We used microarray, bioinformatics analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to identify the downstream signals of IRF4 and to verify the targets in vitro. We compared SMC-IRF4-KO/Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)–TG mice with SMC-IRF4-KO mice and SMC-specific IRF4-TG/KLF4-KO mice with SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice to investigate whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of IRF4 on neointima formation is KLF4-dependent. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of IRF4 on SMC phenotype switching was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IRF4 expression in both the human and mouse restenotic arteries is eventually downregulated. Universal IRF4 ablation potentiates neointima formation in both mice and rats. Immunostaining indicated that IRF4 was expressed primarily in SMCs in restenotic arteries. After injury, SMC-IRF4-KO mice developed a thicker neointima than control mice. This change was accompanied by increased SMC proliferation and migration. However, SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice exhibited the opposite phenotype, demonstrating that IRF4 exerts protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s against neointima formation. The mechanistic study indicated that IRF4 promotes KLF4 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic overexpression of KLF4 in SMCs largely reversed the neointima-promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of IRF4 ablation, whereas ablation of KLF4 abolished the protective function of IRF4, indicating that the protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of IRF4 against neointima formation are KLF4-dependent. In addition, IRF4 promoted SMC dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF4 protects arteries against neointima formation by promoting the expression of KLF4 by directly binding to its promoter. Our findings suggest that this previously undiscovered IRF4-KLF4 axis plays a key role in vasculoproliferative pathology and may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arterial restenosis.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To investigate the bone penetration of intravenous antibiotic   prophylaxis with flucloxacillin and gentamicin during hip and knee   arthroplasty, and their efficacy against <i>Staphylococcus</i> (<i>S.</i>) <i>aureus</i> and <i>S.   epidermidis</i>.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Bone samples from the femoral head, neck and acetabulum were   collected from 18 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA)   and from the femur and tibia in 21 patients during total knee arthroplasty   (TKA). The concentration of both antibiotics in the samples was   analysed using high performance liquid chromatography. Penetration   was expressed as a percentage of venous blood concentration. The   efficacy against common infecting organisms was measured against   both the minimum inhibitory concentration 50, and the more stringent epidemiological   cutoff value for resistance (ECOFF).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The bone penetration of gentamicin was higher than flucloxacillin.

Efficacy and adverse effects of collagenase use in the treatment of Dupuytren’s disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy   of collagenase clostridium histolyticum compared with fasciectomy   and percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) for Dupuytren’s disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science,   Cochrane, Teseo and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for clinical   trials and cohort or case-control studies which compared the clinical   outcomes and adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of collagenase with those of fasciectomy   or PNF.</p><p>Of 1345 articles retrieved, ten were selected.

Cardioprotective Role of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of cells that expand in cancer, inflammation, and infection and negatively regulate inflammation and the immune response. Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome wherein inflammation induction and incomplete resolution can potentially contribute to HF development and progression. However, the role of MDSCs in HF remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The percentage of MDSCs in patients with HF and in mice with pressure overload–induced HF using isoproterenol infusion or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was detected by flow cytometry. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of MDSCs on isoproterenol- or TAC-induced HF were observed on depleting MDSCs with 5-fluorouracil (50 mg/kg) or gemcitabine (120 mg/kg), transferring purified MDSCs, or enhancing endogenous MDSCs with rapamycin (2 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>). Hypertrophic markers and inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA, real-time polymerase chain reaction, or Western blot. Cardiac functions were determined by echocardiography and hemodynamic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The percentage of human leukocyte antigen-D–related (HLA-DR)<sup>−</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> MDSCs in the blood of patients with HF was significantly increased and positively correlated with disease severity and increased plasma levels of cytokines, including interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and transforming growth factor–β. Furthermore, MDSCs derived from patients with HF inhibited T-cell proliferation and interferon-γ secretion. Similar results were observed in TAC- and isoproterenol-induced HF in mice. Pharmaceutical depletion of MDSCs significantly exacerbated isoproterenol- and TAC-induced pathological cardiac remodeling and inflammation, whereas adoptive transfer of MDSCs prominently rescued isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF. Consistently, administration of rapamycin significantly increased endogenous MDSCs by suppressing their differentiation and improved isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF, but MDSC depletion mostly blocked beneficial rapamycin-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s. Mechanistically, MDSC-secreted molecules suppressed isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy and proinflammatory gene expression in cardiomyocytes in a coculture system. Neutralization of interleukin-10 blunted both monocytic MDSC- and granulocytic MDSC–mediated anti-inflammatory and antihypertrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s, but treatment with a nitric oxide inhibitor only partially blocked the antihypertrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of monocytic MDSCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings revealed a cardioprotective role of MDSCs in HF by their antihypertrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on cardiomyocytes and anti-inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s through interleukin-10 and nitric oxide.

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>.</p>

Sexual competition affects biomass partitioning, carbon–nutrient balance, Cd allocation and ultrastructure of <i>Populus cathayana</i> females and males exposed to Cd stress
<p>Although increasing attention has been paid to plant adaptation to soil heavy metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong></span></strong>ation, competition and neighbor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s have been largely overlooked, especially in dioecious plants. In this study, we investigated growth as well as biochemical and ultrastructural responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder females and males to cadmium (Cd) stress under different sexual competition patterns. The results showed that competition significantly affects biomass partitioning, photosynthetic capacity, leaf and root ultrastructure, Cd accumulation, the contents of polyphenols, and structural and nonstructural carbohydrates. Compared with single-sex cultivation, plants of opposite sexes exposed to sexual competition accumulated more Cd in tissues and their growth was more strongly inhibited, indicating enhanced Cd toxicity under sexual competition. Under intrasexual competition, females showed greater Cd accumulation, more serious damage at the ultrastructural level and greater reduction in physiological activity than under intersexual competition, while males performed better under intrasexual competition than under intersexual competition. Males improved the female micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment by greater Cd uptake and lower resource consumption under intersexual competition. These results demonstrate that the sex of neighbor plants and competition affect sexual differences in growth and in key physiological processes under Cd stress. The asymmetry of sexual competition highlighted here might regulate population structure, and spatial segregation and phytoremediation potential of both sexes in <i>P. cathayana</i> growing in heavy metal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong></span></strong>ated soils.</p>

Aerosol-driven droplet concentrations dominate coverage and water of oceanic low-level clouds
<p>A lack of reliable estimates of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) aerosols over oceans has severely limited our ability to quantify their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on cloud properties and extent of cooling by reflecting solar radiation—a key uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. We introduce a methodology for ascribing cloud properties to CCN and isolating the aerosol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s from meteorological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s. Its application showed that for a given meteorology, CCN explains three-fourths of the variability in the radiative cooling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of clouds, mainly through affecting shallow cloud cover and water path. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of cloud <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">radiative forc</span></strong>ing to CCN than previously reported, which means too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This suggests the existence of compensating aerosol warming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s yet to be discovered, possibly through deep clouds.</p>

The South Asian monsoon—pollution pump and purifier
<p>Air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion is growing fastest in monsoon-affected South Asia. During the dry winter monsoon, the fumes disperse toward the Indian Ocean, creating a vast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion haze, but their fate during the wet summer monsoon has been unclear. We performed atmospheric chemistry measurements by aircraft in the Oxidation Mechanism Observations campaign, sampling the summer monsoon outflow in the upper troposphere between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The measurements, supported by model calculations, show that the monsoon sustains a remarkably efficient cleansing mechanism by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong></span></strong>ants are rapidly oxidized and deposited to Earth’s surface. However, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ants are lofted above the monsoon clouds and chemically processed in a reactive reservoir before being redistributed globally, including to the stratosphere.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular genetic variation onto phenotypic trait variation. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s with patterns of phenotypic trait co-variation. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from mutational pleiotropic variation to phenotypic co-variation, including epistatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP map of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s within the GP map match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

Is computer navigation when used in the surgery of iliosacral pelvic bone tumours safer for the patient?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Due to the complex anatomy of the pelvis, limb-sparing resections   of pelvic tumours achieving adequate surgical margins, can often   be difficult. The advent of computer navigation has improved the   precision of resection of these lesions, though there is little   evidence comparing resection with or without the assistance of navigation.</p><p>Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of navigation-assisted surgery   for the resection of pelvic bone tumours involving the posterior   ilium and sacrum. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using our prospectively updated institutional database, we conducted   a retrospective case control study of 21 patients who underwent   resection of the posterior ilium and sacrum, for the treatment of   a primary sarcoma of bone, between 1987 and 2015. The resection   was performed with the assistance of navigation in nine patients   and without navigation in 12. We assessed the accuracy of navigation-assisted   surgery, as defined by the surgical margin and how this affects   the rate of local recurrence, the disease-free survival and the   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on peri-and post-operative morbidity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the patients was 36.4 years (15 to 66).

Effect of Losartan on Right Ventricular Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of angiotensin II receptor blockers on right ventricular (RV) function is still unknown. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are beneficial in patients with acquired left ventricular dysfunction, and recent findings have suggested a favorable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> in symptomatic patients with systemic RV dysfunction. The current study aimed to determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, on subpulmonary RV dysfunction in adults after repaired tetralogy of Fallot.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The REDEFINE trial (Right Ventricular Dysfunction in Tetralogy of Fallot: Inhibition of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Adults with repaired tetralogy of Fallot and RV dysfunction (RV ejection fraction [EF] <50%) but without severe valvular dysfunction were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned between losartan (150 mg daily) and placebo with target treatment duration between 18 and 24 months.

Overall, RV EF did not change in patients allocated to losartan (n=42) (44.4±5.1% to 45.2±5.0%) and placebo (n=46) (43.2±6.3% to 43.6±6.9%).

A Novel α-Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Analogue Protects Against End-Organ Damage in Experimental Hypertension, Cardiac Hypertrophy, and Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Research into the therapeutic potential of α-calcitonin gene–related peptide (α-CGRP) has been limited because of its peptide nature and short half-life. Here, we evaluate whether a novel potent and long-lasting (<i>t</i><sub>½</sub> ≥7 hours) acylated α-CGRP analogue (αAnalogue) could alleviate and reverse cardiovascular disease in 2 distinct murine models of hypertension and heart failure in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ability of the αAnalogue to act selectively via the CGRP pathway was shown in skin by using a CGRP receptor antagonist. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of the αAnalogue on angiotensin II–induced hypertension was investigated over 14 days. Blood pressure was measured by radiotelemetry. The ability of the αAnalogue to modulate heart failure was studied in an abdominal aortic constriction model of murine cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure over 5 weeks. Extensive ex vivo analysis was performed via RNA analysis, Western blot, and histology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The angiotensin II–induced hypertension was attenuated by cotreatment with the αAnalogue (50 nmol·kg<sup>–1</sup>·d<sup>–1</sup>, SC, at a dose selected for lack of long-term hypotensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s at baseline). The αAnalogue protected against vascular, renal, and cardiac dysfunction, characterized by reduced hypertrophy and biomarkers of fibrosis, remodeling, inflammation, and oxidative stress. In a separate study, the αAnalogue reversed angiotensin II–induced hypertension and associated vascular and cardiac damage. The αAnalogue was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive over 5 weeks in a murine model of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. It preserved heart function, assessed by echocardiography, while protecting against adverse cardiac remodeling and apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with the αAnalogue was well tolerated with neither signs of desensitization nor behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings, in 2 distinct models, provide the first evidence for the therapeutic potential of a stabilized αAnalogue, by mediating (1) antihypertensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s, (2) attenuating cardiac remodeling, and (3) increasing angiogenesis and cell survival to protect against and limit damage associated with the progression of cardiovascular diseases. This indicates the therapeutic potential of the CGRP pathway and the possibility that this injectable CGRP analogue may be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive in cardiac disease.</p></sec>

Prospective Study of Adenosine on Atrioventricular Nodal Conduction in Pediatric and Young Adult Patients After Heart Transplantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Supraventricular tachycardia is common after heart transplantation. Adenosine, the standard therapy for treating supraventricular tachycardia in children and adults without transplantation, is relatively contraindicated after transplantation because of a presumed risk of prolonged atrioventricular block in denervated hearts. This study tested whether adenosine caused prolonged asystole after transplantation and if it was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive in blocking atrioventricular nodal conduction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a single-center prospective clinical study including healthy heart transplant recipients 6 months to 25 years of age presenting for routine cardiac catheterization during 2015 to 2016. After catheterization, a transvenous pacing catheter was placed and adenosine was given following a dose-escalation protocol until atrioventricular block was achieved. The incidence of clinically significant asystole (≥12 seconds after adenosine) was quantified. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of patient characteristics on adenosine dose required to produce atrioventricular block and duration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> were also measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eighty patients completed adenosine testing. No patient (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0–3) required rescue ventricular pacing. Atrioventricular block was observed in 77 patients (96%; 95% confidence interval, 89–99).

Left Ventricular Dysfunction Switches Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Toward an Inflammatory Phenotype and Impairs Their Reparative Properties Via Toll-Like Receptor-4
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little is known about the potentially unfavorable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) activation on the heart. MSCs can respond to tissue injury by anti- or proinflammatory activation. We aimed to study the potential negative interaction between left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and MSC activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We isolated MSCs from cardiac and subcutaneous fat tissues of mice with LVD 28 days after myocardial infarction or sham operation. To evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of LVD on MSCs, we characterized cardiac MSCs and subcutaneous MSCs in vitro. Subsequently, we injected MSCs or saline into the infarcted myocardium of mice and evaluated LV remodeling and function 28 days after myocardial infarction. To test the hypothesis that toll-like receptor 4 (<i>TLR4</i>) mediates proinflammatory polarization of MSCs, we characterized cardiac MSCs from <i>TLR4</i><sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type (WT) mice after inflammatory stimulation in vitro. Next, we transplanted cardiac MSCs from <i>TLR4</i><sup>-/-</sup> and WT male mice into the infarcted myocardium of female WT mice and evaluated infarct size, MSC retention, inflammation, remodeling, and function after 7 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>LVD switched cardiac MSCs toward an inflammatory phenotype, with increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines as well as chemokines. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of LVD on subcutaneous MSCs was less remarkable. Although transplantation of cardiac MSCs and subcutaneous MSCs from LVD and sham hearts did not improve LV remodeling and function, cardiac MSCs from LVD exacerbated anterior wall thinning 28 days after myocardial infarction. The inflammatory polarization of cardiac MSCs by LVD was mediated by <i>TLR4</i>, as we found less secretion of inflammatory cytokines and higher secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines from activated cardiac MSCs of <i>TLR4</i>-deficient mice, compared with WT cardiac MSCs. Significantly, <i>TLR4</i> deficiency preserved the expression of CD47 (don’t eat me signal) on cardiac MSCs after both <i>TLR4</i> stimulation in vitro and transplantation into the infarcted heart. Compared with WT cardiac MSCs and saline, <i>TLR4</i> <sup>-/-</sup> cardiac MSCs survived in the cardiac tissue and maintained their reparative properties, reduced infarct size, increased scar thickness, and attenuated LV dilatation 7 days after myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment of the failing and infarcted myocardium drives resident and transplanted MSCs toward a proinflammatory phenotype and restricts their survival and reparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in a mechanism mediated by <i>TLR4</i>.</p></sec>

Low-Dose Paclitaxel–Coated Versus Uncoated Percutaneous Transluminal Balloon Angioplasty for Femoropopliteal Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Numerous studies have reported favorable outcomes using drug-coated balloons (DCBs) for treatment of symptomatic peripheral artery disease of the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. However, the treatment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> compared with an uncoated balloon has differed greatly among the randomized trials, with better outcomes observed with higher-dose DCBs. This European trial was designed to assess the safety and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness of a next-generation low-dose (2-µg/mm<sup>2</sup> surface dose of paclitaxel) DCB.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, single-blinded trial. Patients were randomized (3:1) to treatment with a low-dose DCB or an uncoated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon. The primary safety end point was a composite of freedom from device- and procedure-related death through 30 days after the procedure and freedom from target limb major amputation and clinically driven target lesion revascularization through 12 months after the procedure. The primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness end point was primary patency at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients were randomized to treatment with a DCB (222 patients, 254 lesions) or uncoated PTA balloon (72 patients, 79 lesions) after successful predilatation. Mean lesion length was 7.2 and 7.1 cm, and 19.2% and 19.0% of lesions represented total occlusions, respectively. The primary safety end point was met, and superiority was demonstrated; freedom from a primary safety event was 94.1% (193 of 205) with DCB and 83.3% (50 of 60) with PTA, for a difference of 10.8% (95% confidence interval, 0.9%–23.0%). The primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness end point was met, and superiority of DCB over PTA was achieved (83.9% [188 of 224] versus 60.6% [40 of 66]; <i>P</i><0.001). Outcomes with DCB were also superior to PTA per the Kaplan-Meier estimate for primary patency (89.0% versus 65.0% at 365 days; log-rank <i>P</i><0.001) and for rates of clinically driven target lesion revascularization (5.9% versus 16.7%; <i>P</i>=0.014).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Superiority with a low-dose DCB for femoropopliteal interventions was demonstrated over PTA for both the safety and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>iveness end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

High-Fiber Diet and Acetate Supplementation Change the Gut Microbiota and Prevent the Development of Hypertension and Heart Failure in Hypertensive Mice
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Dietary intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with lower incidence of hypertension, but the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Here, we evaluated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of a high-fiber diet and supplementation with the short-chain fatty acid acetate on the gut microbiota and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gut microbiome, cardiorenal structure/function, and blood pressure were examined in sham and mineralocorticoid excess–treated mice with a control diet, high-fiber diet, or acetate supplementation. We also determined the renal and cardiac transcriptome of mice treated with the different diets.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that high consumption of fiber modified the gut microbiota populations and increased the abundance of acetate-producing bacteria independently of mineralocorticoid excess. Both fiber and acetate decreased gut dysbiosis, measured by the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and increased the prevalence of <i>Bacteroides acidifaciens</i>. Compared with mineralocorticoid-excess mice fed a control diet, both high-fiber diet and acetate supplementation significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures, cardiac fibrosis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Acetate had similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s and markedly reduced renal fibrosis. Transcriptome analyses showed that the protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of high fiber and acetate were accompanied by the downregulation of cardiac and renal <i>Egr1</i>, a master cardiovascular regulator involved in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiorenal fibrosis, and inflammation. We also observed the upregulation of a network of genes involved in circadian rhythm in both tissues and downregulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A diet high in fiber led to changes in the gut microbiota that played a protective role in the development of cardiovascular disease.

Protective Effects of Ticagrelor on Myocardial Injury After Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist ticagrelor has been shown to be clinically superior to clopidogrel. Although the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, ticagrelor may exert off-target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s through adenosine-related mechanisms. We aimed to investigate whether ticagrelor reduces myocardial injury to a greater extent than clopidogrel after myocardial infarction (MI) at a similar level of platelet inhibition and to determine the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pigs received the following before MI induction: (1) placebo-control; (2) a loading dose of clopidogrel (600 mg); (3) a loading dose of ticagrelor (180 mg); or (4) a loading dose of ticagrelor followed by an adenosine A1/A2-receptor antagonist [8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline, 4 mg/kg intravenous] to determine the potential contribution of adenosine in ticagrelor-related cardioprotection. Animals received the corresponding maintenance doses of the antiplatelet agents during the following 24 hours and underwent 3T-cardiac MRI analysis. Platelet inhibition was monitored by ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In the myocardium, we assessed the expression and activation of proteins known to modulate edema formation, including aquaporin-4 and AMP-activated protein kinase and its downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ors CD36 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Clopidogrel and ticagrelor exerted a high and consistent antiplatelet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> (68.2% and 62.2% of platelet inhibition, respectively, on challenge with 20 μmol/L ADP) that persisted up to 24 hours post-MI (<i>P</i><0.05). All groups showed comparable myocardial area-at-risk and cardiac worsening after MI induction. 3T-Cardiac MRI analysis revealed that clopidogrel- and ticagrelor-treated animals had a significantly smaller extent of MI than placebo-control animals (15.7 g left ventricle and 12.0 g left ventricle versus 22.8 g left ventricle, respectively). Yet, ticagrelor reduced infarct size to a significantly greater extent than clopidogrel (further 23.5% reduction; <i>P</i>=0.0026), an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> supported by troponin-I assessment and histopathologic analysis (<i>P</i>=0.0021). Furthermore, in comparison with clopidogrel, ticagrelor significantly diminished myocardial edema by 24.5% (<i>P</i>=0.004), which correlated with infarct mass (<i>r</i>=0.73; <i>P</i><0.001). 8-(<i>p</i>-Sulfophenyl)theophylline administration abolished the cardioprotective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of ticagrelor over clopidogrel. At a molecular level, aquaporin-4 expression decreased and the expression and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling and cyclooxygenase-2 increased in the ischemic myocardium of ticagrelor- versus clopidogrel-treated animals (<i>P</i><0.05). These protein changes were not observed in those animals administered the adenosine receptor blocker 8-(<i>p</i>-sulfophenyl)theophylline.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ticagrelor, beyond its antiplatelet efficacy, exerts cardioprotective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s by reducing necrotic injury and edema formation via adenosine-dependent mechanisms.</p></sec>

Cardiovascular Consequences of Childhood Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure: Prevailing Evidence, Burden, and Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although public health programs have led to a substantial decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking, the adverse health <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of tobacco smoke exposure are by no means a thing of the past. In the United States, 4 of 10 school-aged children and 1 of 3 adolescents are involuntarily exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS), with children of minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in low-socioeconomic-status households being disproportionately affected (68% and 43%, respectively). Children are particularly vulnerable, with little control over home and social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment, and lack the understanding, agency, and ability to avoid SHS exposure on their own volition; they also have physiological or behavioral characteristics that render them especially susceptible to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of SHS. Side-stream smoke (the smoke emanating from the burning end of the cigarette), a major component of SHS, contains a higher concentration of some toxins than mainstream smoke (inhaled by the smoker directly), making SHS potentially as dangerous as or even more dangerous than direct smoking. Compelling animal and human evidence shows that SHS exposure during childhood is detrimental to arterial function and structure, resulting in premature atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular consequences. Childhood SHS exposure is also related to impaired cardiac autonomic function and changes in heart rate variability. In addition, childhood SHS exposure is associated with clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Individualized interventions to reduce childhood exposure to SHS are shown to be at least modestly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive, as are broader-based policy initiatives such as community smoking bans and increased taxation.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>The purpose of this statement is to summarize the available evidence on the cardiovascular health consequences of childhood SHS exposure; this will support ongoing efforts to further reduce and eliminate SHS exposure in this vulnerable population. This statement reviews relevant data from epidemiological studies, laboratory-based experiments, and controlled behavioral trials concerning SHS and cardiovascular disease risk in children. Information on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of SHS exposure on the cardiovascular system in animal and pediatric studies, including vascular disruption and platelet activation, oxidation and inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular stiffness, changes in vascular structure, and autonomic dysfunction, is examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The epidemiological, observational, and experimental evidence accumulated to date demonstrates the detrimental cardiovascular consequences of SHS exposure in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications:</title><p>Increased awareness of the adverse, lifetime cardiovascular consequences of childhood SHS may facilitate the development of innovative individual, family-centered, and community health interventions to reduce and ideally eliminate SHS exposure in the vulnerable pediatric population. This evidence calls for a robust public health policy that embraces zero tolerance of childhood SHS exposure.</p></sec>

In vivo brain GPCR signaling elucidated by phosphoproteomics
<p>A systems view of G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling in its native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ment is central to the development of GPCR therapeutics with fewer side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s. Using the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) as a model, we employed high-throughput phosphoproteomics to investigate signaling induced by structurally diverse agonists in five mouse brain regions. Quantification of 50,000 different phosphosites provided a systems view of KOR in vivo signaling, revealing novel mechanisms of drug action. Thus, we discovered enrichment of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway by U-50,488H, an agonist causing aversion, which is a typical KOR-mediated side <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>. Consequently, mTOR inhibition during KOR activation abolished aversion while preserving beneficial antinociceptive and anticonvulsant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s. Our results establish high-throughput phosphoproteomics as a general strategy to investigate GPCR in vivo signaling, enabling prediction and modulation of behavioral outcomes.</p>

The effect of partisanship and political advertising on close family ties
<p>Research on growing American political polarization and antipathy primarily studies public institutions and political processes, ignoring private <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s, including strained family ties. Using anonymized smartphone-location data and precinct-level voting, we show that Thanksgiving dinners attended by residents from opposing-party precincts were 30 to 50 minutes shorter than same-party dinners. This decline from a mean of 257 minutes survives extensive spatial and demographic controls. Reductions in the duration of Thanksgiving dinner in 2016 tripled for travelers from media markets with heavy political advertising—an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> not observed in 2015—implying a relationship to election-related behavior. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s appear asymmetric: Although fewer Democratic-precinct residents traveled in 2016 than in 2015, Republican-precinct residents shortened their Thanksgiving dinners by more minutes in response to political differences.

Flexo-photovoltaic effect
<p>It is highly desirable to discover photovoltaic mechanisms that enable enhanced efficiency of solar cells. Here we report that the bulk photovoltaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>, which is free from the thermodynamic Shockley-Queisser limit but usually manifested only in noncentrosymmetric (piezoelectric or ferroelectric) materials, can be realized in any semiconductor, including silicon, by mediation of flexoelectric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>. We used either an atomic force microscope or a micrometer-scale indentation system to introduce strain gradients, thus creating very large photovoltaic currents from centrosymmetric single crystals of strontium titanate, titanium dioxide, and silicon. This strain gradient–induced bulk photovoltaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>, which we call the flexo-photovoltaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>, functions in the absence of a p-n junction.

Plastic waste associated with disease on coral reefs

We assessed the influence of plastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wast</span></strong>e on disease risk in 124,000 reef-building corals from 159 reefs in the Asia-Pacific region. The likelihood of disease increases from 4% to 89% when corals are in contact with plastic. Structurally complex corals are eight times more likely to be affected by plastic, suggesting that micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s for reef-associated organisms and valuable fisheries will be disproportionately affected. Plastic levels on coral reefs correspond to estimates of terrestrial mismanaged plastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wast</span></strong>e entering the ocean.

Retrieval practice protects memory against acute stress

We aimed to determine whether a highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ive learning technique could strengthen memory against the negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of stress. To bolster memory, we used retrieval practice, or the act of taking practice tests. Participants first learned stimuli by either restudying or engaging in retrieval practice. Twenty-four hours later, we induced stress in half of the participants and assessed subsequent memory performance. Participants who learned by restudying demonstrated the typical stress-related memory impairment, whereas those who learned by retrieval practice were immune to the deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of stress. These results suggest that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of stress on memory retrieval may be contingent on the strength of the memory representations themselves.</p>

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>ors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene recognition leads to necrotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>or-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of the host gene-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout isolates showed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene interactions leading to necrotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>or-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Different Modes of Negative Regulation of Plant Immunity by Calmodulin-Related Genes
<p>Plant immune responses activated through the perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns, leading to pattern-triggered immunity, are tightly regulated. This results in low immune responses in the absence of pathogens and a rapid return to the resting state following an activation event. Here, we show that two <i>CALMODULIN-LIKE</i> genes, <i>CML46</i> and <i>CML47</i>, negatively regulate salicylic acid accumulation and immunity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The double mutant <i>cml46 cml47</i> is highly resistant to the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> (<i>Pma</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of <i>cml46 cml47</i> on <i>Pma</i> growth are genetically additive to that of <i>cbp60a</i>, a known negative regulator in the <i>CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN60</i> (<i>CBP60</i>) family. Transcriptome profiling revealed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> on both common and separate sets of genes, with the majorities of these differentially expressed genes being <i>Pma</i> responsive. <i>CBP60g</i>, a positive regulator of immunity in the <i>CBP60</i> family, was found to be transcriptionally regulated by <i>CBP60a</i>, <i>CML46</i>, and <i>CML47</i>. Analysis of the flg22-induced mRNA levels of <i>CBP60g</i> in <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> revealed that <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants have higher induced expression while <i>cbp60a</i> plants retain elevated levels longer than wild-type plants. Assays for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of flg22 treatment on <i>Pma</i> growth showed that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> is stronger in <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants and lasts longer in <i>cbp60a</i> plants. Thus, the expression pattern of <i>CBP60g</i> is reflected in flg22-induced resistance to <i>Pma</i>.</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major mineral types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these minerals and the control that the leaf exerts over mineral deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the mineral locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the minerals, and mineral volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D mineral distribution that is preserved in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. The mineral distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

<p>Diapause is an adaptation that allows organisms to survive harsh <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental conditions. In species occurring over broad <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong> ranges, both the timing and the intensity of diapause induction can vary across populations, revealing patterns of local adaptation. Understanding the genetic architecture of this fitness-related trait would help clarify how populations adapt to their local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments. In the cyclical parthenogenetic crustacean <i>Daphnia magna</i>, diapause induction is a phenotypic plastic life history trait linked to sexual reproduction, as asexual females have the ability to switch to sexual reproduction and produce resting stages, their sole strategy for surviving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong> deterioration. We have previously shown that the induction of resting stage production correlates with changes in photoperiod that indicate the imminence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong> deterioration and have identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) responsible for some of the variation in the induction of resting stages. Here, new data allows us to anchor the QTL to a large scaffold and then, using a combination of a new mapping panel, targeted association mapping and selection analysis in natural populations, to identify candidate genes within the QTL. Our results show that variation in a rhodopsin photoreceptor gene plays a significant role in the variation observed in resting stage induction. This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the link between diapause and day-length perception that has been suggested in diverse arthropod taxa.</p>

The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most phenotypic traits are controlled by many genes, but a global picture of the genotype–phenotype map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know generally how many genes affect a trait and how large these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are shaped by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the reverse genetic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding yeast strains, each of which lacks a nonessential gene. We show that 1) the proportion of genes affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are impacted by many more small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> genes than large-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> genes, and 3) the mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of all nonessential genes on a trait decreases precipitously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 yeast gene expression traits in 754 gene-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of genome-wide reverse genetics in genotype–phenotype mapping, uncover an enormous range of genetic complexity of phenotypic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been shaped by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

Strong Epistatic Interactions within a Single Protein
<p>A central question in protein molecular evolution is whether an amino acid that occurs at a given site makes an independent contribution to fitness or whether its contribution depends on other amino acid sites in the protein sequence, a phenomenon known as intragenic epistasis. In the absence of intragenic epistasis, natural selection acts on a protein mutation independent of its genetic background, and the experimentally determined fitness for a mutation should be the same across all genetic backgrounds. We tested this hypothesis by using site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a well-characterized deleterious single amino acid substitution in 56 different hepatitis C virus NS3 protease variants. The catalytic efficiency of the mutated proteases was determined and compared with the corresponding wild-type protein. Fitness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s ranged from lethality to significantly beneficial. Although primarily deleterious and lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s were observed (41 and 5 out of 56 tested variants, respectively), deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s ranged from near neutral (−26.7% reduction of fitness) to near lethal (−98.5%). Our findings demonstrate that the introduced amino acid substitution has different fitness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s in different protein variants and provide independent support for the relevant role of intragenic epistasis in protein evolution.</p>

A Comprehensive, High-Resolution Map of a Gene’s Fitness Landscape
<p>Mutations are central to evolution, providing the genetic variation upon which selection acts. A mutation’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> on the suitability of a gene to perform a particular function (gene fitness) can be positive, negative, or neutral. Knowledge of the distribution of fitness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s (DFE) of mutations is fundamental for understanding evolutionary dynamics, molecular-level genetic variation, complex genetic disease, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the molecular clock. We present comprehensive DFEs for point and codon mutants of the <i>Escherichia coli TEM-1</i> β-lactamase gene and missense mutations in the TEM-1 protein. These DFEs provide insight into the inherent benefits of the genetic code’s architecture, support for the hypothesis that mRNA stability dictates codon usage at the beginning of genes, an extensive framework for understanding protein mutational tolerance, and evidence that mutational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s on protein thermodynamic stability shape the DFE. Contrary to prevailing expectations, we find that deleterious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of mutation primarily arise from a decrease in specific protein activity and not cellular protein levels.</p>

Temperature mediates the effect of humidity on the viscoelasticity of glycoprotein glue within the droplets of an orb-weaving spider's prey capture threads
<p>Sticky viscous prey capture threads retain insects that strike araneoid orb-webs. The threads' two axial fibers support a series of glue droplets, each featuring a core of adhesive viscoelastic glycoprotein covered by an aqueous solution. After sticking, the glue extends, summing the adhesion of multiple droplets, and dissipates some of the energy of a struggling prey. As a day progresses, threads experience a drop in humidity and an increase in temperature, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental variables that have the potential to alter thread and web function. We hypothesize that thread droplets respond to these opposing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>mental changes in a manner that stabilizes their performance, and test this by examining threads spun by <i>Argiope aurantia</i>, a species that occupies exposed, weedy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s. We confirmed that decreased humidity increases glycoprotein viscosity and found that increased temperature had the opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>. To evaluate the combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of temperature and humidity on a droplet's ability to transfer adhesive force and dissipate energy, we extended a droplet and measured both the deflection of the axial line supporting the droplet and the duration of its tensive load. The cumulative product of these two indices, which reflects the energy required to extend a droplet, was greatest under afternoon (hot and dry) conditions, less under morning (cool and humid) conditions, and least under hot and humid afternoon conditions. Although the opposing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of temperature and humidity tend to stabilize glycoprotein performance, <i>A. aurantia</i> thread droplets appear to function optimally during the afternoon, equipping this species to capture large orthopterans, which are most active at this time.</p>

Trans-generational plasticity in physiological thermal tolerance is modulated by maternal pre-reproductive environment in the polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i>
<p>Maternal temperature is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with temperature changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete <i>Ophryotrocha labronica</i> to investigate the influence of maternal temperature on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30°C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24°C and then exposed to 18 or 30°C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24°C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother–offspring temperatures did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when temperatures persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30°C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother–offspring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">environ</span></strong>ments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-generational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of temperature on physiological performance characterised by a high context dependency, and are discussed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences.</p>

The role of light in mediating the effects of ocean acidification on coral calcification
<p>We tested the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on the calcification and survival of <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i> recruits settled from larvae released in southern Taiwan. In March 2011, recruits were incubated at 31, 41, 70, 122 and 226 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> under ambient (493 μatm) and high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> (878 μatm). After 5 days, calcification was measured gravimetrically and survivorship estimated as the number of living recruits. Calcification was affected by the interaction of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> with light, and at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> the response to light intensity resembled a positive parabola. At 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of light on calcification differed from that observed at 493 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, with the result that there were large differences in calcification between 493 μatm and 878 μatm <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> at intermediate light intensities (<i>ca</i>. 70 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), but similar rates of calcification at the highest and lowest light intensities. Survivorship was affected by light and <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub>, and was highest at 122 μmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> in both <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> treatments, but was unrelated to calcification. In June 2012 the experiment was repeated, and again the results suggested that exposure to high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> decreased calcification of <i>P. damicornis</i> recruits at intermediate light intensities, but not at lower or higher intensities. Together, our findings demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong> of <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on coral recruits can be light dependent, with inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of high <i>P</i><sub>CO<sub>2</sub></sub> on calcification at intermediate light intensities that disappear at both higher and lower light intensities.</p>

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood samples from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular risk. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s and whether harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma samples at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein risk score validated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib. Their pathway analysis revealed unexpected and widespread changes in immune and inflammatory functions, as well as changes in endocrine systems, including in aldosterone function and glycemic control. At baseline, 9-protein risk scores were similar in the 2 treatment arms and higher in participants with subsequent events. At 3 months, the absolute 9-protein derived risk increased in the torcetrapib plus atorvastatin arm compared with the atorvastatin-only arm by 1.08% (<i>P</i>=0.0004). Thirty-seven proteins changed in the direction of increased risk of 49 proteins previously associated with cardiovascular and mortality risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Heretofore unknown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effect</span></strong>s of torcetrapib were revealed in immune and inflammatory functions. A protein-based risk score predicted harm from torcetrapib within just 3 months. A protein-based risk assessment embedded within a large proteomic survey may prove to be useful in the evaluation of therapies to prevent harm to patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

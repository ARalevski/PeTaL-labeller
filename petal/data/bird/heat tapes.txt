Revision anatomical reconstruction of the lateral ligaments of the ankle augmented with suture tape for patients with a failed Broström procedure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the intermediate-term   outcomes after revision anatomical ankle ligament reconstruction   augmented with suture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tape</span></strong> for a failed modified Broström procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 30 patients with persistent instability of the ankle   after a Broström procedure underwent revision augmented with suture   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tape</span></strong>. Of these, 24 patients who were followed up for more than two   years were included in the study. There were 13 men and 11 women.   Their mean age was 31.8 years (23 to 44). The mean follow-up was 38.5   months (24 to 56) The clinical outcome was assessed using the Foot   and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure   (FAAM) score. The stability of the ankle was assessed using stress   radiographs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean FAOS and FAAM scores improved significantly to 87.5   (73 to 94) and 85.1 (70 to 95) points at final follow-up, respectively   (p < 0.001). The mean angle of talar tilt and anterior talar   translation improved significantly to 2.8° (0° to 6°) and 4.1 mm   (2 to 7) at final follow-up, respectively (p < 0.001). Side to   side comparison in stress radiographs at final follow-up showed   no significant difference. The revision failed in one patient who   underwent a further revision using allograft tendon.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The revision modified Broström procedure augmented with suture   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tape</span></strong> is an effective form of treatment for recurrent instability   of the ankle following a failed Broström procedure. This technique   provides reliable stability and satisfactory clinical outcomes at   intermediate-term follow-up.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1183–9</p></sec>

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials
<p>Although flakes of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures at the micrometer scale can be formed with adhesive-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tape</span></strong> exfoliation methods, isolation of 2D flakes into monolayers is extremely time consuming because it is a trial-and-error process. Controlling the number of 2D layers through direct growth also presents difficulty because of the high nucleation barrier on 2D materials. We demonstrate a layer-resolved 2D material splitting technique that permits high-throughput production of multiple monolayers of wafer-scale (5-centimeter diameter) 2D materials by splitting single stacks of thick 2D materials grown on a single wafer. Wafer-scale uniformity of hexagonal boron nitride, tungsten disulfide, tungsten diselenide, molybdenum disulfide, and molybdenum diselenide monolayers was verified by photoluminescence response and by substantial retention of electronic conductivity. We fabricated wafer-scale van der Waals heterostructures, including field-effect transistors, with single-atom thickness resolution.</p>

Multiplex recording of cellular events over time on CRISPR biological tape
<p>Although dynamics underlie many biological processes, our ability to robustly and accurately profile time-varying biological signals and regulatory programs remains limited. Here we describe a framework for storing temporal biological information directly in the genomes of a cell population. We developed a “biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tape</span></strong> recorder” in which biological signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then recorded by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable recording over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously record the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling biological events on a large scale.</p>

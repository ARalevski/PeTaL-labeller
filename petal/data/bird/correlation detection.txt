Learning and attention reveal a general relationship between population activity and behavior
<p>Prior studies have demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability changes with cognitive processes that improve perceptual performance. We tested whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability covaries with subjects’ performance—whether performance improves quickly with attention or slowly with perceptual learning. We found a single, consistent relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability and behavioral performance, regardless of the time frame of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability change. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability was oriented along the dimensions in population space used by the animal on a trial-by-trial basis to make decisions. That subjects’ choices were predicted by specific dimensions that were aligned with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability axis clarifies long-standing paradoxes about the relationship between shared variability and behavior.</p>

Correlations in high-harmonic generation of matter-wave jets revealed by pattern recognition
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations in interacting many-body systems are key to the study of quantum matter. The complexity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations typically grows quickly as the system evolves and thus presents a challenge for experimental characterization and intuitive understanding. In a strongly driven Bose-Einstein condensate, we observe the high-harmonic generation of matter-wave jets with complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations as a result of bosonic stimulation. Based on a pattern recognition scheme, we identify a pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations that reveals the underlying secondary scattering processes and higher-order <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations. We show that pattern recognition offers a versatile strategy to visualize and analyze the quantum dynamics of a many-body system.</p>

Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The metal-insulator transition in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated materials is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition. This coupling not only complicates the understanding of the basic mechanism of this phenomenon but also limits the speed and endurance of prospective electronic devices. We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven metal-insulator transition in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated material, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an interface interaction suppresses the electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations without changing the crystal structure in this otherwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated insulator. This interaction stabilizes a nonequilibrium metallic phase and leads to an isostructural metal-insulator transition. This discovery will provide insights into phase transitions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated materials and may aid the design of device functionalities.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Impaired Cyclic Electron Flow around Photosystem I Disturbs High-Light Respiratory Metabolism
<p>The cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (CEF-PSI) increases ATP/NADPH production in the chloroplast, acting as an energy balance mechanism. Higher export of reducing power from the chloroplast in CEF-PSI mutants has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with higher mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and protein amount under high-light (HL) conditions. However, in vivo measurements of AOX activity are still required to confirm the exact role of AOX in dissipating the excess of reductant power from the chloroplast. Here, CEF-PSI single and double mutants were exposed to short-term HL conditions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Chlorophyll fluorescence, in vivo activities of the cytochrome oxidase (ν<sub>cyt</sub>) and AOX (ν<sub>alt</sub>) pathways, levels of mitochondrial proteins, metabolite profiles, and pyridine nucleotide levels were determined under normal growth and HL conditions. ν<sub>alt</sub> was not increased in CEF-PSI mutants, while AOX capacity was positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with photoinhibition, probably due to a reactive oxygen species-induced increase of AOX protein. The severe metabolic impairment observed in CEF-PSI mutants, as indicated by the increase in photoinhibition and changes in the levels of stress-related metabolites, can explain their lack of ν<sub>alt</sub> induction. By contrast, ν<sub>cyt</sub> was positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with photosynthetic performance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations with metabolite changes suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> is coordinated with sugar metabolism and stress-related amino acid synthesis. Furthermore, changes in glycine-serine and NADH-NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios were highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated to ν<sub>cyt</sub>. Taken together, our results suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> can act as a sink for the excess of electrons from the chloroplast, probably via photorespiratory glycine oxidation, thus improving photosynthetic performance when ν<sub>alt</sub> is not induced under severe HL stress.</p>

Tuning superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene
<p>Materials with flat electronic bands often exhibit exotic quantum phenomena owing to strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations. An isolated low-energy flat band can be induced in bilayer graphene by simply rotating the layers by 1.1°, resulting in the appearance of gate-tunable superconducting and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated insulating phases. In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to the twist angle, the interlayer coupling can be varied to precisely tune these phases. We induce superconductivity at a twist angle larger than 1.1°—in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated phases are otherwise absent—by varying the interlayer spacing with hydrostatic pressure. Our low-disorder devices reveal details about the superconducting phase diagram and its relationship to the nearby insulator. Our results demonstrate twisted bilayer graphene to be a distinctively tunable platform for exploring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated states.</p>

Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated single atoms cooperatively emit photons. Demonstration of controlled collective atom-field interactions has resulted from the ability to directly imprint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations with an atomic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-atom superradiance: Single atoms with predefined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> atoms that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of atoms). Enhanced collective photoemission of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity atom number was less than unity. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation among single atoms was achieved by nanometer-precision position control and phase-aligned state manipulation of atoms by using a nanohole-array aperture. Our results demonstrate a platform for phase-controlled atom-field interactions.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

Recovery performance in xylem hydraulic conductivity is correlated with cavitation resistance for temperate deciduous tree species
<p>Woody species hydraulically vulnerable to xylem cavitation may experience daily xylem embolism. How such species cope with the possibility of accumulated embolism is unclear. In this study, we examined seven temperate woody species to assess the hypothesis that low cavitation resistance (high vulnerability to cavitation) is compensated by high recovery performance via vessel refilling. We also evaluated leaf functional and xylem structural traits. The xylem recovery index (XRI), defined as the ratio of xylem hydraulic conductivity in plants rewatered after soil drought to that in plants under moist conditions, varied among species. The xylem water potential causing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (Ψ<sub>50</sub>) varied among the species studied, whereas only a slight difference was detected with respect to midday xylem water potential (Ψ<sub>min</sub>), indicating smaller hydraulic safety margins (Ψ<sub>min</sub> − Ψ<sub>50</sub>) for species more vulnerable to cavitation. Cavitation resistance (|Ψ<sub>50</sub>|) was negatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with XRI across species, with cavitation-vulnerable species showing a higher performance in xylem recovery. Wood density was positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with cavitation resistance and was negatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with XRI. These novel results reveal that coordination exists between cavitation resistance and xylem recovery performance, in association with wood functional traits such as denser wood for cavitation-resistant xylem and less-dense but water-storable wood for refillable xylem. These findings provide insights into long-term maintenance of water transport in tree species growing under variable environmental conditions.</p>

Tunable quantum criticality and super-ballistic transport in a “charge” Kondo circuit
<p>Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) are ubiquitous in strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated materials. However, the microscopic complexity of these systems impedes the quantitative understanding of QPTs. We observed and thoroughly analyzed the rich strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated physics in two profoundly dissimilar regimes of quantum criticality. With a circuit implementing a quantum simulator for the three-channel Kondo model, we reveal the universal scalings toward different low-temperature fixed points and along the multiple crossovers from quantum criticality. An unanticipated violation of the maximum conductance for ballistic free electrons is uncovered. The present charge pseudospin implementation of a Kondo impurity opens access to a broad variety of strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated phenomena.</p>

Ghost cytometry
<p>Ghost imaging is a technique used to produce an object’s image without using a spatially resolving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detector</span></strong>. Here we develop a technique we term “ghost cytometry,” an image-free ultrafast fluorescence “imaging” cytometry based on a single-pixel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detector</span></strong>. Spatial information obtained from the motion of cells relative to a static randomly patterned optical structure is compressively converted into signals that arrive sequentially at a single-pixel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detector</span></strong>. Combinatorial use of the temporal waveform with the intensity distribution of the random pattern allows us to computationally reconstruct cell morphology. More importantly, we show that applying machine-learning methods directly on the compressed waveforms without image reconstruction enables efficient image-free morphology-based cytometry. Despite a compact and inexpensive instrumentation, image-free ghost cytometry achieves accurate and high-throughput cell classification and selective sorting on the basis of cell morphology without a specific biomarker, both of which have been challenging to accomplish using conventional flow cytometers.</p>

High-temperature pairing in a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas
<p>The nature of the normal phase of strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated fermionic systems is an outstanding question in quantum many-body physics. We used spatially resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure pairing energy of fermions across a wide range of temperatures and interaction strengths in a two-dimensional gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We observed many-body pairing at temperatures far above the critical temperature for superfluidity. In the strongly interacting regime, the pairing energy in the normal phase considerably exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing in this regime is driven by many-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations, rather than two-body physics. Our findings show that pairing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations in strongly interacting two-dimensional fermionic systems are remarkably robust against thermal fluctuations.</p>

Maxima in the thermodynamic response and correlation functions of deeply supercooled water
<p>Femtosecond x-ray laser pulses were used to probe micrometer-sized water droplets that were cooled down to 227 kelvin in vacuum. Isothermal compressibility and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation length were extracted from x-ray scattering at the low–momentum transfer region. The temperature dependence of these thermodynamic response and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation functions shows maxima at 229 kelvin for water and 233 kelvin for heavy water. In addition, we observed that the liquids undergo the fastest growth of tetrahedral structures at similar temperatures. These observations point to the existence of a Widom line, defined as the locus of maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation length emanating from a critical point at positive pressures in the deeply supercooled regime. The difference in the maximum value of the isothermal compressibility between the two isotopes shows the importance of nuclear quantum effects.</p>

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators
<p>Topological phases, like the Haldane phase in spin-1 chains, defy characterization through local order parameters. Instead, nonlocal string order parameters can be employed to reveal their hidden order. Similar diluted magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of spin-charge separation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations via quantum gas microscopy of hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of nonlocal spin-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation functions reveals a hidden finite-range antiferromagnetic order, a direct consequence of spin-charge separation. Our technique, which measures nonlocal order directly, can be readily extended to higher dimensions to study the complex interplay between magnetic order and density fluctuations.</p>

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) isotope compositions in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative conditions in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fraction, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

Hornwort Stomata: Architecture and Fate Shared with 400-Million-Year-Old Fossil Plants without Leaves
<p>As one of the earliest plant groups to evolve stomata, hornworts are key to understanding the origin and function of stomata. Hornwort stomata are large and scattered on sporangia that grow from their bases and release spores at their tips. We present data from development and immunocytochemistry that identify a role for hornwort stomata that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with sporangial and spore maturation. We measured guard cells across the genera with stomata to assess developmental changes in size and to analyze any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation with genome size. Stomata form at the base of the sporophyte in the green region, where they develop differential wall thickenings, form a pore, and die. Guard cells collapse inwardly, increase in surface area, and remain perched over a substomatal cavity and network of intercellular spaces that is initially fluid filled. Following pore formation, the sporophyte dries from the outside inwardly and continues to do so after guard cells die and collapse. Spore tetrads develop in spore mother cell walls within a mucilaginous matrix, both of which progressively dry before sporophyte dehiscence. A lack of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation between guard cell size and DNA content, lack of arabinans in cell walls, and perpetually open pores are consistent with the inactivity of hornwort stomata. Stomata are expendable in hornworts, as they have been lost twice in derived taxa. Guard cells and epidermal cells of hornworts show striking similarities with the earliest plant fossils. Our findings identify an architecture and fate of stomata in hornworts that is ancient and common to plants without sporophytic leaves.</p>

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension

To evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation and agreement of blood pressure in HealthLNK in comparison with in-person MESA examinations, and body mass index in HealthLNK in comparison with MESA, we used Pearson <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots. Using diagnoses in MESA as the criterion standard, we calculated the performance of HealthLNK for hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus diagnosis by using <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</i> codes and clinical data.

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation was low for systolic blood pressure (0.39; <i>P</i><0.0001). In comparison with MESA, HealthLNK overestimated systolic blood pressure by 6.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 4.2–7.8). There was a high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation between body mass index in MESA and HealthLNK (0.94; <i>P</i><0.0001). HealthLNK underestimated body mass index by 0.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% confidence interval, –0.4 to –0.1). With the use of <i>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</i> codes and clinical data, the sensitivity and specificity of HealthLNK queries for hypertension were 82.4% and 59.4%, for obesity were 73.0% and 89.8%, and for diabetes mellitus were 79.8% and 93.3%. In comparison with adjudicated cardiovascular events in MESA, the concordance rates for myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure were, respectively, 41.7% (5/12), 61.5% (8/13), and 62.5% (10/16).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings illustrate the limitations and strengths of electronic data repositories in comparison with information collected by traditional standardized epidemiological approaches for the ascertainment of cardiovascular risk factors and events.</p></sec>

Transcription Factor RUNX1 Regulates Platelet <i>PCTP</i> (Phosphatidylcholine Transfer Protein): Implications for Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>PCTP (phosphatidylcholine transfer protein) regulates the intermembrane transfer of phosphatidylcholine. Higher platelet PCTP expression is associated with increased platelet responses on activation of protease-activated receptor 4 thrombin receptors noted in black subjects compared with white subjects. Little is known about the regulation of platelet <i>PCTP</i>. Haplodeficiency of RUNX1, a major hematopoietic transcription factor, is associated with thrombocytopenia and impaired platelet responses on activation. Platelet expression profiling of a patient with a <i>RUNX1</i> loss-of-function mutation revealed a 10-fold downregulation of the <i>PCTP</i> gene compared with healthy controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We pursued the hypothesis that <i>PCTP</i> is regulated by RUNX1 and that <i>PCTP</i> expression is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with cardiovascular events. We studied RUNX1 binding to the <i>PCTP</i> promoter using DNA-protein binding studies and human erythroleukemia cells and promoter activity using luciferase reporter studies. We assessed the relationship between <i>RUNX1</i> and <i>PCTP</i> in peripheral blood RNA and <i>PCTP</i> and death or myocardial infarction in 2 separate patient cohorts (587 total patients) with cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Platelet PCTP protein in the patient was reduced by ≈50%. DNA-protein binding studies showed RUNX1 binding to consensus sites in ≈1 kB of <i>PCTP</i> promoter. <i>PCTP</i> expression was increased with <i>RUNX1</i> overexpression and reduced with <i>RUNX1</i> knockdown in human erythroleukemia cells, indicating that <i>PCTP</i> is regulated by RUNX1. Studies in 2 cohorts of patients showed that <i>RUNX1</i> expression in blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with <i>PCTP</i> gene expression; <i>PCTP</i> expression was higher in black compared with white subjects and was associated with future death/myocardial infarction after adjustment for age, sex, and race (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval 1.6–2.7; <i>P</i><0.0001). <i>RUNX1</i> expression is known to initiate at 2 alternative promoters, a distal P1 and a proximal P2 promoter. In patient cohorts, there were differential effects of <i>RUNX1</i> isoforms on <i>PCTP</i> expression with a negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation in blood between <i>RUNX1</i> expressed from the P1 promoter and <i>PCTP</i> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><i>PCTP</i> is a direct transcriptional target of RUNX1. <i>PCTP</i> expression is associated with death/myocardial infarction in patients with cardiovascular disease.

Neural correlates of ticklishness in the rat somatosensory cortex
<p>Rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations in response to tickling by humans. Tickling is rewarding through dopaminergic mechanisms, but the function and neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ates of ticklishness are unknown. We confirmed that tickling of rats evoked vocalizations, approach, and unsolicited jumps (Freudensprünge). Recordings in the trunk region of the rat somatosensory cortex showed intense tickling-evoked activity in most neurons, whereas a minority of cells were suppressed by tickling. Tickling responses predicted nontactile neural responses to play behaviors, which suggests a neuronal link between tickling and play. Anxiogenic conditions suppressed tickling-evoked vocalizations and trunk cortex activity. Deep-layer trunk cortex neurons discharged during vocalizations, and deep-layer microstimulation evoked vocalizations. Our findings provide evidence for deep-layer trunk cortex activity as a neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ate of ticklishness.</p>

Observing the ultrafast buildup of a Fano resonance in the time domain
<p>Although the time-dependent buildup of asymmetric Fano line shapes in absorption spectra has been of great theoretical interest in the past decade, experimental verification of the predictions has been elusive. Here, we report the experimental observation of the emergence of a Fano resonance in the prototype system of helium by interrupting the autoionization process of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated two-electron excited state with a strong laser field. The tunable temporal gate between excitation and termination of the resonance allows us to follow the formation of a Fano line shape in time. The agreement with ab initio calculations validates our experimental time-gating technique for addressing an even broader range of topics, such as the emergence of electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation, the onset of electron-internuclear coupling, and quasi-particle formation.</p>

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The dynamics of many-body systems spanning condensed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase transitions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose condensates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives condensates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the condensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.</p>

A Critical Role of Sodium Flux via the Plasma Membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Exchanger SOS1 in the Salt Tolerance of Rice
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) stands among the world's most important crop species. Rice is salt sensitive, and the undue accumulation of sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) in shoots has the strongest negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation with rice productivity under long-term salinity. The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger protein Salt Overly Sensitive 1 (SOS1) is the sole Na<sup>+</sup> efflux transporter that has been genetically characterized to date. Here, the importance of SOS1-facilitated Na<sup>+</sup> flux in the salt tolerance of rice was analyzed in a reverse-genetics approach. A <i>sos1</i> loss-of-function mutant displayed exceptional salt sensitivity that was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with excessive Na<sup>+</sup> intake and impaired Na<sup>+</sup> loading into the xylem, thus indicating that SOS1 controls net root Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and long-distance Na<sup>+</sup> transport to shoots. The acute Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of <i>sos1</i> plants at low NaCl concentrations allowed analysis of the transcriptional response to sodicity stress without effects of the osmotic stress intrinsic to high-salinity treatments. In contrast with that in the wild type, <i>sos1</i> mutant roots displayed preferential down-regulation of stress-related genes in response to salt treatment, despite the greater intensity of stress experienced by the mutant. These results suggest there is impaired stress detection or an inability to mount a comprehensive response to salinity in <i>sos1</i>. In summary, the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger SOS1 plays a major role in the salt tolerance of rice by controlling Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and possibly contributing to the sensing of sodicity stress.</p>

Polyploidy Affects Plant Growth and Alters Cell Wall Composition
<p>Polyploidization has played a key role in plant breeding and crop improvement. Although its potential to increase biomass yield is well described, the effect of polyploidization on biomass composition has largely remained unexplored. Here, we generated a series of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants with different somatic ploidy levels (2n, 4n, 6n, and 8n) and performed rigorous phenotypic characterization. Kinematic analysis showed that polyploids developed slower compared to diploids; however, tetra- and hexaploids, but not octaploids, generated larger rosettes due to delayed flowering. In addition, morphometric analysis of leaves showed that polyploidy affected epidermal pavement cells, with increased cell size and reduced cell number per leaf blade with incrementing ploidy. However, the inflorescence stem dry weight was highest in tetraploids. Cell wall characterization revealed that the basic somatic ploidy level negatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with lignin and cellulose content, and positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with matrix polysaccharide content (i.e. hemicellulose and pectin) in the stem tissue. In addition, higher ploidy plants displayed altered sugar composition. Such effects were linked to the delayed development of polyploids. Moreover, the changes in polyploid cell wall composition promoted saccharification yield. The results of this study indicate that induction of polyploidy is a promising breeding strategy to further tailor crops for biomass production.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with the appearance of singlet oxygen, as visualized using the singlet oxygen-specific probe singlet oxygen sensor green. The production of singlet oxygen was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular accumulation of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell death began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet oxygen were observed. The accumulation of other reactive oxygen species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ate with cell death. In addition, both the singlet oxygen scavenger His and the lipoxygenase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet oxygen accumulation and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet oxygen production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the accumulation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet oxygen plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the plant primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences plant growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed coat mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with an increase in the calcium content of the seed mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in seed coat mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in seed coat mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the seed coat in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole seed. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in seed coat mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in seed coat mucilage formation.</p>

Extended Vernalization Regulates Inflorescence Fate in <i>Arabis alpina</i> by Stably Silencing <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i>
<p>The alpine perennial <i>Arabis alpina</i> initiates flower buds during prolonged exposure to cold. In the accession Pajares, we demonstrate that the length of vernalization influences flowering time and inflorescence fate but does not affect the axillary branches that maintain vegetative growth. The expression of floral organ identity genes gradually increases in the main shoot apex during vernalization, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ating with an increase in floral commitment. In northern Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions, the length of vernalization modulates the stable silencing of the floral repressor <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>). We demonstrate that expression of <i>PERPETUAL FLOWERING1</i> (<i>PEP1</i>), the ortholog of <i>FLC</i> in <i>A. alpina</i>, is similarly influenced by the duration of the exposure to cold. Extended vernalization results in stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence. In contrast, insufficient vernalization leads to <i>PEP1</i> reactivation after cold treatment, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ates with delayed flowering and the appearance of floral reversion phenotypes such as bracts and vegetative inflorescence branches. Floral reversion phenotypes are reduced in the <i>pep1-1</i> mutant, suggesting that <i>PEP1</i> regulates the fate of the inflorescence after vernalization. The effect of vernalization duration on stable silencing of <i>PEP1</i> is specific to meristems that initiate flowering during cold treatment. Extended vernalization fails to silence <i>PEP1</i> in young seedlings and axillary branches that arise from buds initiated during cold treatment, which remain vegetative. We conclude that the duration of vernalization in <i>A. alpina</i> differentially regulates <i>PEP1</i> in the inflorescence and axillary branches. <i>PEP1</i> has a dual role regulating meristem fate; it prevents meristems from flowering and antagonizes inflorescence development after vernalization.</p>

Glucose-Induced Trophic Shift in an Endosymbiont Dinoflagellate with Physiological and Molecular Consequences<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>Interactions between the dinoflagellate endosymbiont <i>Symbiodinium</i> and its cnidarian hosts (e.g. corals, sea anemones) are the foundation of coral-reef ecosystems. Carbon flow between the partners is a hallmark of this mutualism, but the mechanisms governing this flow and its impact on symbiosis remain poorly understood. We showed previously that although <i>Symbiodinium</i> strain SSB01 can grow photoautotrophically, it can grow mixotrophically or heterotrophically when supplied with Glc, a metabolite normally transferred from the alga to its host. Here we show that Glc supplementation of SSB01 cultures causes a loss of pigmentation and photosynthetic activity, disorganization of thylakoid membranes, accumulation of lipid bodies, and alterations of cell-surface morphology. We used global transcriptome analyses to determine if these physiological changes were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with changes in gene expression. Glc-supplemented cells exhibited a marked reduction in levels of plastid transcripts encoding photosynthetic proteins, although most nuclear-encoded transcripts (including those for proteins involved in lipid synthesis and formation of the extracellular matrix) exhibited little change in their abundances. However, the altered carbon metabolism in Glc-supplemented cells was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with modest alterations (approximately 2x) in the levels of some nuclear-encoded transcripts for sugar transporters. Finally, Glc-bleached SSB01 cells appeared unable to efficiently populate anemone larvae. Together, these results suggest links between energy metabolism and cellular physiology, morphology, and symbiotic interactions. However, the results also show that in contrast to many other organisms, <i>Symbiodinium</i> can undergo dramatic physiological changes that are not reflected by major changes in the abundances of nuclear-encoded transcripts and thus presumably reflect posttranscriptional regulatory processes.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data normalization and network inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For network inference, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single networks together resulted in improved performance compared to single networks.</p>

Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant respiration can theoretically be fueled by and dependent upon an array of central metabolism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative variation found in respiratory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale screens revealed 2-fold variation in nighttime leaf respiration rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural accession collection grown under common favorable conditions. R<sub>N</sub> variation was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic variation, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental differences within the sampling regime. To pursue metabolic explanations for leaf R<sub>N</sub> variation, parallel metabolite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an accession, R<sub>N</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated strongly with stored carbon substrates, including starch and dicarboxylic acids, as well as sucrose, major amino acids, shikimate, and salicylic acid. Among different accessions, metabolite-R<sub>N</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino acids but not stored carbon substrates. A complementary screen of the effect of exogenous metabolites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is stimulated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of substrates, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and substrate supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic nitrogen did not stimulate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited nighttime nitrogen assimilation. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated in mature leaves. These results indicate that differences in preceding daytime metabolic activities are the major source of variation in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled conditions.</p>

Root Cell-Specific Regulators of Phosphate-Dependent Growth
<p>Cellular specialization in abiotic stress responses is an important regulatory feature driving plant acclimation. Our in silico approach of iterative coexpression, interaction, and enrichment analyses predicted root cell-specific regulators of phosphate starvation response networks in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). This included three uncharacterized genes termed Phosphate starvation-induced gene interacting Root Cell Enriched (<i>PRCE1</i>, <i>PRCE2</i>, and <i>PRCE3</i>). Root cell-specific enrichment of 12 candidates was confirmed in promoter-GFP lines. T-DNA insertion lines of 11 genes showed changes in phosphate status and growth responses to phosphate availability compared with the wild type. Some mutants (<i>cbl1</i>, <i>cipk2</i>, <i>prce3</i>, and <i>wdd1</i>) displayed strong biomass gain irrespective of phosphate supply, while others (<i>cipk14</i>, <i>mfs1</i>, <i>prce1</i>, <i>prce2</i>, and <i>s6k2</i>) were able to sustain growth under low phosphate supply better than the wild type. Notably, root or shoot phosphate accumulation did not strictly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ate with organ growth. Mutant response patterns markedly differed from those of master regulators of phosphate homeostasis, <i>PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1</i> (<i>PHR1</i>) and <i>PHOSPHATE2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>), demonstrating that negative growth responses in the latter can be overcome when cell-specific regulators are targeted. RNA sequencing analysis highlighted the transcriptomic plasticity in these mutants and revealed PHR1-dependent and -independent regulatory circuits with gene coexpression profiles that were highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated to the quantified physiological traits. The results demonstrate how in silico prediction of cell-specific, stress-responsive genes uncovers key regulators and how their manipulation can have positive impacts on plant growth under abiotic stress.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Gas Exchange: The Balance between Carbon Fixation and Water Loss
<p>Stomatal control of transpiration is critical for maintaining important processes, such as plant water status, leaf temperature, as well as permitting sufficient CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion into the leaf to maintain photosynthetic rates (<i>A</i>). Stomatal conductance often closely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ates with <i>A</i> and is thought to control the balance between water loss and carbon gain. It has been suggested that a mesophyll-driven signal coordinates <i>A</i> and stomatal conductance responses to maintain this relationship; however, the signal has yet to be fully elucidated. Despite this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation under stable environmental conditions, the responses of both parameters vary spatially and temporally and are dependent on species, environment, and plant water status. Most current models neglect these aspects of gas exchange, although it is clear that they play a vital role in the balance of carbon fixation and water loss. Future efforts should consider the dynamic nature of whole-plant gas exchange and how it represents much more than the sum of its individual leaf-level components, and they should take into consideration the long-term effect on gas exchange over time.</p>

Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll conductance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and water use efficiencies. To improve water use efficiency, mesophyll conductance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll conductance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that mesophyll conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll conductance is positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation between mesophyll and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between mesophyll conductance and water use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll conductance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll conductance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing water use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal conductance.</p>

Correlations between Circadian Rhythms and Growth in Challenging Environments
<p>In plants, the circadian system controls a plethora of processes, many with agronomic importance, such as photosynthesis, photoprotection, stomatal opening, and photoperiodic development, as well as molecular processes, such as gene expression. It has been suggested that modifying circadian rhythms may be a means to manipulate crops to develop improved plants for agriculture. However, there is very little information on how the clock influences the performance of crop plants. We used a noninvasive, high-throughput technique, based on prompt chlorophyll fluorescence, to measure circadian rhythms and demonstrated that the technique works in a range of plants. Using fluorescence, we analyzed circadian rhythms in populations of wild barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> ssp. <i>spontaneum</i>) from widely different ecogeographical locations in the Southern Levant part of the Fertile Crescent, an area with a high proportion of the total genetic variation of wild barley. Our results show that there is variability for circadian traits in the wild barley lines. We observed that circadian period lengths were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with temperature and aspect at the sites of origin of the plants, while the amplitudes of the rhythms were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with soil composition. Thus, different environmental parameters may exert selection on circadian rhythms.</p>

Here, we demonstrate that genus <i>Malus</i> adapt to Fe deficiency through modification of the <i>Iron-Regulated Transporter1</i> (<i>IRT1</i>) promoter. Specifically, an <i>IRT1</i> mutant allele with a TATA-box insertion in the promoter region upstream of the coding region exhibited increased <i>IRT1</i> expression. The altered <i>IRT1</i> promoter is responsible for enhancing Fe uptake. Increasing the number of synthetic repeat TATA-boxes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ates with increased promoter activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the insertion of the TATA-box <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ates with an increase in transcriptional activation via specific binding of the transcription factor IID (MDP0000939369). Taken together, these results indicate that an allelic insertion of a TATA-box in a gene promoter has allowed apple to adapt to the selective pressure posed by Fe deficiency. More broadly, this study reveals a new mechanism for enhancing gene expression to help plants adapt to different environments, providing new insights into molecular genetic divergence in plants.</p>

Transcriptome and Degradome Sequencing Reveals Dormancy Mechanisms of <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> Seeds<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Seeds with physiological dormancy usually experience primary and secondary dormancy in the nature; however, little is known about the differential regulation of primary and secondary dormancy. We combined multiple approaches to investigate cytological changes, hormonal levels, and gene expression dynamics in <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> seeds during primary dormancy release and secondary dormancy induction. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that protein bodies in the embryo cells coalesced during primary dormancy release and then separated during secondary dormancy induction. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that expression of genes negatively regulating gibberellic acid (GA) sensitivity reduced specifically during primary dormancy release, whereas the expression of genes positively regulating abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis increased during secondary dormancy induction. Parallel analysis of RNA ends revealed uncapped transcripts for ∼55% of all unigenes. A negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation between fold changes in expression levels of uncapped versus capped mRNAs was observed during primary dormancy release. However, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation was loose during secondary dormancy induction. Our analyses suggest that the reversible changes in cytology and gene expression during dormancy release and induction are related to ABA/GA balance. Moreover, mRNA degradation functions as a critical posttranscriptional regulator during primary dormancy release. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding physiological dormancy in seeds.</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate gene expression in eukaryotes, but their roles in gene expression changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes at the single cell level and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for analyzing individual genes. Here, we comparatively analyzed immunostained metaphase chromosomes and ChIP-seq of individual genes, which revealed a chromatin basis for biased homoeologous gene expression in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D chromosomes, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed genes between the two subgenomes. However, intensities per chromosomal area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with biased modifications <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with the greater number of the genes with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous chromosome pairs. Two chromosomes displayed different expression levels compared with other chromosomes, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ate with known translocations and may affect the local chromatin structure and expression levels for the genes involved. This example of genome-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous genes in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal decomposition of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW decay in which lignin and carbohydrates are both degraded. Mechanistic studies of decay coupled with comparative genomic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their evolutionary origins, but the complete suite of genes necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylogenomic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in gene family diversification rates that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with evolution of WR, using data from 62 fungal genomes. We detected 409 gene families that appear to be evolutionarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with WR. The identified gene families encode well-characterized decay enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as well as 73 gene families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 identified gene families are present in the genome of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results illuminate the complexity of WR and suggest that its evolution has involved a general elaboration of the decay apparatus, including numerous gene families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

Phylogenetic Tools for Generalized HIV-1 Epidemics: Findings from the PANGEA-HIV Methods Comparison
<p>Viral phylogenetic methods contribute to understanding how HIV spreads in populations, and thereby help guide the design of prevention interventions. So far, most analyses have been applied to well-sampled concentrated HIV-1 epidemics in wealthy countries. To direct the use of phylogenetic tools to where the impact of HIV-1 is greatest, the Phylogenetics And Networks for Generalized HIV Epidemics in Africa (PANGEA-HIV) consortium generates full-genome viral sequences from across sub-Saharan Africa. Analyzing these data presents new challenges, since epidemics are principally driven by heterosexual transmission and a smaller fraction of cases is sampled. Here, we show that viral phylogenetic tools can be adapted and used to estimate epidemiological quantities of central importance to HIV-1 prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. We used a community-wide methods comparison exercise on simulated data, where participants were blinded to the true dynamics they were inferring. Two distinct simulations captured generalized HIV-1 epidemics, before and after a large community-level intervention that reduced infection levels. Five research groups participated. Structured coalescent modeling approaches were most successful: phylogenetic estimates of HIV-1 incidence, incidence reductions, and the proportion of transmissions from individuals in their first 3 months of infection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with the true values (Pearson <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation > 90%), with small bias. However, on some simulations, true values were markedly outside reported confidence or credibility intervals. The blinded comparison revealed current limits and strengths in using HIV phylogenetics in challenging settings, provided benchmarks for future methods’ development, and supports using the latest generation of phylogenetic tools to advance HIV surveillance and prevention.</p>

Fine-Tuning Motile Cilia and Flagella: Evolution of the Dynein Motor Proteins from Plants to Humans at High Resolution
<p>The flagellum is a key innovation linked to eukaryogenesis. It provides motility by regulated cycles of bending and bend propagation, which are thought to be controlled by a complex arrangement of seven distinct dyneins in repeated patterns of outer- (OAD) and inner-arm dynein (IAD) complexes. Electron tomography showed high similarity of this axonemal repeat pattern across ciliates, algae, and animals, but the diversity of dynein sequences across the eukaryotes has not yet comprehensively been resolved and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with structural data. To shed light on the evolution of the axoneme I performed an exhaustive analysis of dyneins using the available sequenced genome data. Evidence from motor domain phylogeny allowed expanding the current set of nine dynein subtypes by eight additional isoforms with, however, restricted taxonomic distributions. I confirmed the presence of the nine dyneins in all eukaryotic super-groups indicating their origin predating the last eukaryotic common ancestor. The comparison of the N-terminal tail domains revealed a most likely axonemal dynein origin of the new classes, a group of chimeric dyneins in plants/algae and Stramenopiles, and the unique domain architecture and origin of the outermost OADs present in green algae and ciliates but not animals. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation of sequence and structural data suggests the single-headed class-8 and class-9 dyneins to localize to the distal end of the axonemal repeat and the class-7 dyneins filling the region up to the proximal heterodimeric IAD. Tracing dynein gene duplications across the eukaryotes indicated ongoing diversification and fine-tuning of flagellar functions in extant taxa and species.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle motion, with particle motion dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detector</span></strong>s, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle motion component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Heart rate as a predictor of metabolic rate in heterothermic bats
<p>While heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) has been used as an indicator of energy expenditure, quantitative data showing the relationship between these variables are only available for normothermic animals. To determine whether <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> also predicts oxygen consumption ([Formula]) during torpor, we simultaneously measured [Formula], <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and subcutaneous body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>sub</sub>) of a hibernator, Gould's long-eared bats (<i>Nyctophilus gouldi</i>, 9 g, <i>N</i>=18), at ambient temperatures (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>) between 0 and 25°C. At rest, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of normothermic resting bats was negatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with <i>T</i><sub>a</sub>, with maximum <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of 803 beats min<sup>−1</sup> (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>=5°C). During torpor, the relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>a</sub> was curvilinear, and at low <i>T</i><sub>sub</sub> (~6°C), <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> fell to a minimum average of 8 beats min<sup>−1</sup>. The minimum average values for both [Formula] and <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in torpor reported here were among the lowest recorded for bats. The relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and [Formula] was significant for both resting (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.64, <i>P</i><0.001) and torpid bats (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.84, <i>P</i><0.001), with no overlap between the two states. These variables were also significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.44, <i>P</i><0.001) for entire torpor bouts. Moreover, estimates of [Formula] from <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> did not differ significantly from measured values during the different physiological states. Our study is the first to investigate the accuracy of <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> as a predictor of [Formula] during torpor and indicates the reliability of this method as a potential measure of energy expenditure in the field. Nevertheless, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> should only be used to predict [Formula] within the range of activities for which robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations have been established.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with changes in both reproductive physiology and behavior. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and behavior in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We analyzed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a behavior that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific behavioral patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in behavior and dominance with reproductive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain ion and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular function and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relationship between muscle and haemolymph ion homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relationship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of ion homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular function are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to ion disturbance but instead is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years.

In contrast,   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation between leg alignment and magnitude of medial compartment force   was much less pronounced.

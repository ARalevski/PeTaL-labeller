Essential roles of AMPA receptor GluA1 phosphorylation and presynaptic HCN channels in fast-acting antidepressant responses of ketamine
<p>Although the molecular mechanism is not clear, the clinically tested drug ketamine has rapid antidepressant action that does not require the multiple weeks of treatment needed for other antidepressant drugs to have an effect. We showed that ketamine potentiated Schaffer collateral–CA1 cell excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slice preparations from rodents and enhanced the phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit on Ser<sup>845</sup> of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor in the hippocampal area CA1. These effects persisted when γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors were pharmacologically blocked. Ketamine reduced behavioral despair in wild-type mice but had no effect in GluA1 S845A knock-in mutant mice. Presynaptic (CA3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>al cell), but not postsynaptic (CA1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>al cell), deletion of <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA)–type glutamate receptors eliminated the ketamine-induced enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices and the antidepressant actions of ketamine in mice. The synaptic and behavioral actions of ketamine were completely occluded by inhibition or deletion of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated channel 1 (HCN1). Our results implicate presynaptic NMDA receptor inhibition followed by reduced activity of presynaptic HCN1 channels, which would result in an increase in glutamate release and postsynaptic glutamate receptor activity, as a mechanism of ketamine action. These data provide a mechanism for changes in synaptic activity that could explain the fast-acting antidepressant effects of this drug.</p>

CRAC channels regulate astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and gliotransmitter release to modulate hippocampal GABAergic transmission
<p>Astrocytes are the major glial subtype in the brain and mediate numerous functions ranging from metabolic support to gliotransmitter release through signaling mechanisms controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Despite intense interest, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx pathways in astrocytes remain obscure, hindering mechanistic insights into how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is coupled to downstream astrocyte-mediated effector functions. Here, we identified store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release–activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channels encoded by Orai1 and STIM1 as a major route of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry for driving sustained and oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in astrocytes after stimulation of metabotropic purinergic and protease-activated receptors. Using synaptopHluorin as an optical reporter, we showed that the opening of astrocyte CRAC channels stimulated vesicular exocytosis to mediate the release of gliotransmitters, including ATP. Furthermore, slice electrophysiological recordings showed that activation of astrocytes by protease-activated receptors stimulated interneurons in the CA1 hippocampus to increase inhibitory postsynaptic currents on CA1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>al cells. These results reveal a central role for CRAC channels as regulators of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, gliotransmitter release, and astrocyte-mediated tonic inhibition of CA1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>al neurons.</p>

Spatial representations of self and other in the hippocampus
<p>An animal’s awareness of its location in space depends on the activity of place cells in the hippocampus. How the brain encodes the spatial position of others has not yet been identified. We investigated neuronal representations of other animals’ locations in the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus with an observational T-maze task in which one rat was required to observe another rat’s trajectory to successfully retrieve a reward. Information reflecting the spatial location of both the self and the other was jointly and discretely encoded by CA1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>al cells in the observer rat. A subset of CA1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>al cells exhibited spatial receptive fields that were identical for the self and the other. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal spatial representations include dimensions for both self and nonself.</p>

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions
<p>HIV-1 contains a cone-shaped capsid encasing the viral genome. This capsid is thought to follow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fulleren</span></strong>e geometry—a curved hexameric lattice of the capsid protein, CA, closed by incorporating 12 CA pentamers. Current models for core structure are based on crystallography of hexameric and cross-linked pentameric CA, electron microscopy of tubular CA arrays, and simulations. Here, we report subnanometer-resolution cryo–electron tomography structures of hexameric and pentameric CA within intact HIV-1 particles. Whereas the hexamer structure is compatible with crystallography studies, the pentamer forms using different interfaces. Determining multiple structures revealed how CA flexes to form the variably curved core shell. We show that HIV-1 CA assembles both aberrant and perfect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fulleren</span></strong>e cones, supporting models in which conical cores assemble de novo after maturation.</p>

Aberrant Rac1-cofilin signaling mediates defects in dendritic spines, synaptic function, and sensory perception in fragile X syndrome
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disabilities and a leading cause of autism. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the gene <i>FMR1</i> on the X chromosome. The neuroanatomical hallmark of FXS is an overabundance of immature dendritic spines, a factor thought to underlie synaptic dysfunction and impaired cognition. We showed that aberrantly increased activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 inhibited the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin, a major determinant of dendritic spine structure, and caused disease-associated spine abnormalities in the somatosensory cortex of FXS model mice. Increased cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization coincided with abnormal dendritic spines and impaired synaptic maturation. Viral delivery of a constitutively active cofilin mutant (cofilinS3A) into the somatosensory cortex of <i>Fmr1</i>-deficient mice rescued the immature dendritic spine phenotype and increased spine density. Inhibition of the Rac1 effector PAK1 with a small-molecule inhibitor rescued cofilin signaling in FXS mice, indicating a causal relationship between PAK1 and cofilin signaling. PAK1 inhibition rescued synaptic signaling (specifically the synaptic ratio of NMDA/AMPA in layer V <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>al neurons) and improved sensory processing in FXS mice. These findings suggest a causal relationship between increased Rac1-cofilin signaling, synaptic defects, and impaired sensory processing in FXS and uncover a previously unappreciated role for impaired Rac1-cofilin signaling in the aberrant spine morphology and spine density associated with FXS.</p>

Distinct molecular programs regulate synapse specificity in cortical inhibitory circuits
<p>How neuronal connections are established and organized into functional networks determines brain function. In the mammalian cerebral cortex, different classes of GABAergic interneurons exhibit specific connectivity patterns that underlie their ability to shape temporal dynamics and information processing. Much progress has been made toward parsing interneuron diversity, yet the molecular mechanisms by which interneuron-specific connectivity motifs emerge remain unclear. In this study, we investigated transcriptional dynamics in different classes of interneurons during the formation of cortical inhibitory circuits in mouse. We found that whether interneurons form synapses on the dendrites, soma, or axon initial segment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>al cells is determined by synaptic molecules that are expressed in a subtype-specific manner. Thus, cell-specific molecular programs that unfold during early postnatal development underlie the connectivity patterns of cortical interneurons.</p>

The concise nine-step synthesis featuring successive borylations and couplings proceeded with an average yield for each benzene-benzene bond formation of 91%. The molecular structure of the nanometer-sized cylinder with periodic vacancy defects was confirmed spectroscopically and crystallographically.

Total quantum state–resolved spectroscopy of isolated C<sub>60</sub> molecules has been of particularly long-standing interest. Such observations have, to date, been unsuccessful owing to the difficulty in preparing cold, gas-phase C<sub>60</sub> in sufficiently high densities. Here we report high-resolution infrared absorption spectroscopy of C<sub>60</sub> in the 8.5-micron spectral region (1180 to 1190 wave number). A combination of cryogenic buffer-gas cooling and cavity-enhanced direct frequency comb spectroscopy has enabled the observation of quantum state–resolved rovibrational transitions. Characteristic nuclear spin statistical intensity patterns confirm the indistinguishability of the 60 carbon-12 atoms, while rovibrational fine structure encodes further details of the molecule’s rare icosahedral symmetry.</p>

Mechanistic origin and prediction of enhanced ductility in magnesium alloys
<p>Pure magnesium exhibits poor ductility owing to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>al [Formula] dislocation transformations to immobile structures, making this lowest-density structural metal unusable for many applications where it could enhance energy efficiency. We show why magnesium can be made ductile by specific dilute solute additions, which increase the [Formula] cross-slip and multiplication rates to levels much faster than the deleterious [Formula] transformation, enabling both favorable texture during processing and continued plastic straining during deformation. A quantitative theory establishes the conditions for ductility as a function of alloy composition in very good agreement with experiments on many existing magnesium alloys, and the solute-enhanced cross-slip mechanism is confirmed by transmission electron microscopy observations in magnesium-yttrium. The mechanistic theory can quickly screen for alloy compositions favoring conditions for high ductility and may help in the development of high-formability magnesium alloys.</p>

Dynamics of cortical dendritic membrane potential and spikes in freely behaving rats
<p>Neural activity in vivo is primarily measured using extracellular somatic spikes, which provide limited information about neural computation. Hence, it is necessary to record from neuronal dendrites, which can generate dendritic action potentials (DAPs) in vitro, which can profoundly influence neural computation and plasticity. We measured neocortical sub- and suprathreshold dendritic membrane potential (DMP) from putative distal-most dendrites using tetrodes in freely behaving rats over multiple days with a high degree of stability and submillisecond temporal resolution. DAP firing rates were several-fold larger than somatic rates. DAP rates were also modulated by subthreshold DMP fluctuations, which were far larger than DAP amplitude, indicating hybrid, analog-digital coding in the dendrites. Parietal DAP and DMP exhibited egocentric spatial maps comparable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>al neurons. These results have important implications for neural coding and plasticity.</p>

Epigenetic regulation of antagonistic receptors confers rice blast resistance with yield balance
<p>Crop breeding aims to balance disease resistance with yield; however, single resistance (R) genes can lead to resistance breakdown, and R gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>ing may affect growth fitness. Here we report that the rice <i>Pigm</i> locus contains a cluster of genes encoding nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors that confer durable resistance to the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> without yield penalty. Among these NLR receptors, PigmR confers broad-spectrum resistance, whereas PigmS competitively attenuates PigmR homodimerization to suppress resistance. <i>PigmS</i> expression, and thus <i>PigmR</i>-mediated resistance, are subjected to tight epigenetic regulation. <i>PigmS</i> increases seed production to counteract the yield cost induced by <i>PigmR</i>. Therefore, our study reveals a mechanism balancing high disease resistance and yield through epigenetic regulation of paired antagonistic NLR receptors, providing a tool to develop elite crop varieties.</p>

Layer-specific modulation of neocortical dendritic inhibition during active wakefulness
<p>γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inputs are strategically positioned to gate synaptic integration along the dendritic arbor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>al cells. However, their spatiotemporal dynamics during behavior are poorly understood. Using an optical-tagging electrophysiological approach to record and label somatostatin-expressing (Sst) interneurons (GABAergic neurons specialized for dendritic inhibition), we discovered a layer-specific modulation of their activity in behaving mice. Sst interneuron subtypes, residing in different cortical layers and innervating complementary laminar domains, exhibited opposite activity changes during transitions to active wakefulness. The relative weight of vasoactive intestinal peptide–expressing (Vip) interneuron–mediated inhibition of distinct Sst interneurons and cholinergic modulation determined their in vivo activity. These results reveal a state-dependent laminar influence of Sst interneuron–mediated inhibition, with implications for the compartmentalized regulation of dendritic signaling in the mammalian neocortex.</p>

Ubiquitin Specific Protease 15 Has an Important Role in Regulating Grain Width and Size in Rice
<p>Ubiquitination and deubiquitination are reversible processes that play crucial roles in regulating organ size in plants. However, information linking deubiquitination and seed size in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is limited. Here, we characterized a dominant large-grain mutant, <i>large grain1-D</i> (<i>lg1-D</i>), with a 30.8% increase in seed width and a 34.5% increase in 1,000-grain weight relative to the wild type. The <i>lg1-D</i> mutant had more cells oriented in the lateral direction of the spikelet hull compared with the wild type. Map-based cloning showed that <i>LG1</i> encodes a constitutively expressed ubiquitin-specific protease15 (OsUBP15) that possesses deubiquitination activity in vitro. Loss-of-function and down-regulated expression of <i>OsUBP15</i> produced narrower and smaller grains than the control. A set of in vivo experiments indicated that the mutant Osubp15 had enhanced protein stability relative to wild-type OsUBP15. Further experiments verified that OsDA1 directly interacted with OsUBP15. Genetic data indicated that <i>OsUBP15</i> and <i>GRAIN WIDTH 2</i> (<i>GW2</i>) were not independent in regulating grain width and size. In summary, we identified OsUBP15 as a positive regulator of grain width and size in rice and provide a promising strategy for improvement of grain yield by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>ing <i>OsUBP15</i> and <i>gw2</i>.</p>

ABC Transporter-Mediated Transport of Glutathione Conjugates Enhances Seed Yield and Quality in Chickpea
<p>The identification of functionally relevant molecular tags is vital for genomics-assisted crop improvement and enhancement of seed yield, quality, and productivity in chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>). The simultaneous improvement of yield/productivity as well as quality traits often requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pyramid</span></strong>ing of multiple genes, which remains a major hurdle given various associated epistatic and pleotropic effects. Unfortunately, no single gene that can improve yield/productivity along with quality and other desirable agromorphological traits is known, hampering the genetic enhancement of chickpea. Using a combinatorial genomics-assisted breeding and functional genomics strategy, this study identified natural alleles and haplotypes of an <i>ABCC3</i>-type transporter gene that regulates seed weight, an important domestication trait, by transcriptional regulation and modulation of the transport of glutathione conjugates in seeds of <i>desi</i> and <i>kabuli</i> chickpea. The superior allele/haplotype of this gene introgressed in <i>desi</i> and <i>kabuli</i> near-isogenic lines enhances the seed weight, yield, productivity, and multiple desirable plant architecture and seed-quality traits without compromising agronomic performance. These salient findings can expedite crop improvement endeavors and the development of nutritionally enriched high-yielding cultivars in chickpea.</p>

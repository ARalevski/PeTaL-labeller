Adaptive introgression underlies polymorphic seasonal camouflage in snowshoe hares
<p>Snowshoe hares (<i>Lepus americanus</i>) maintain seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">camouflag</span></strong>e by molting to a white winter coat, but some hares remain brown during the winter in regions with low snow cover. We show that cis-regulatory variation controlling seasonal expression of the <i>Agouti</i> gene underlies this adaptive winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">camouflag</span></strong>e polymorphism. Genetic variation at <i>Agouti</i> clustered by winter coat color across multiple hare and jackrabbit species, revealing a history of recurrent interspecific gene flow. Brown winter coats in snowshoe hares likely originated from an introgressed black-tailed jackrabbit allele that has swept to high frequency in mild winter environments. These discoveries show that introgression of genetic variants that underlie key ecological traits can seed past and ongoing adaptation to rapidly changing environments.</p>

Adaptive infrared-reflecting systems inspired by cephalopods
<p>Materials and systems that statically reflect radiation in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum underpin the performance of many entrenched technologies, including building insulation, energy-conserving windows, spacecraft components, electronics shielding, container packaging, protective clothing, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">camouflag</span></strong>e platforms. The development of their adaptive variants, in which the infrared-reflecting properties dynamically change in response to external stimuli, has emerged as an important unmet scientific challenge. By drawing inspiration from cephalopod skin, we developed adaptive infrared-reflecting platforms that feature a simple actuation mechanism, low working temperature, tunable spectral range, weak angular dependence, fast response, stability to repeated cycling, amenability to patterning and multiplexing, autonomous operation, robust mechanical properties, and straightforward manufacturability. Our findings may open opportunities for infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">camouflag</span></strong>e and other technologies that regulate infrared radiation.</p>

Stretchable surfaces with programmable 3D texture morphing for synthetic camouflaging skins
<p>Technologies that use stretchable materials are increasingly important, yet we are unable to control how they stretch with much more sophistication than inflating balloons. Nature, however, demonstrates remarkable control of stretchable surfaces; for example, cephalopods can project hierarchical structures from their skin in milliseconds for a wide range of textural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">camouflag</span></strong>e. Inspired by cephalopod muscular morphology, we developed synthetic tissue groupings that allowed programmable transformation of two-dimensional (2D) stretchable surfaces into target 3D shapes. The synthetic tissue groupings consisted of elastomeric membranes embedded with inextensible textile mesh that inflated to within 10% of their target shapes by using a simple fabrication method and modeling approach. These stretchable surfaces transform from flat sheets to 3D textures that imitate natural stone and plant shapes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">camouflag</span></strong>e into their background environments.</p>

URI is required to maintain intestinal architecture during ionizing radiation
<p>Ionizing radiation (IR) can cause gastrointestinal syndrome (GIS), a lethal disorder, by means of unknown mechanisms. We show that high-dose irradiation increases unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor (URI) levels in mouse intestinal crypt, but organ regeneration correlates with URI reductions. URI overexpression in intestine protects mice from radiation-induced GIS, whereas halving URI expression sensitizes mice to IR. URI specifically inhibits β-catenin in stem cell–like label-retaining (LR) cells, which are essential for organ regeneration after IR. URI reduction activates β-catenin–induced c-MYC expression, causing proliferation of and DNA damage to LR cells, rendering them radiosensitive. Therefore, URI labels LR cells which promote tissue regeneration in response to high-dose irradiation, and c-MYC inhibitors could be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">countermeasur</span></strong>es for humans at risk of developing GIS.</p>

Chameleon-like elastomers with molecularly encoded strain-adaptive stiffening and coloration
<p>Active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">camouflag</span></strong>e is widely recognized as a soft-tissue feature, and yet the ability to integrate adaptive coloration and tissuelike mechanical properties into synthetic materials remains elusive. We provide a solution to this problem by uniting these functions in moldable elastomers through the self-assembly of linear-bottlebrush-linear triblock copolymers. Microphase separation of the architecturally distinct blocks results in physically cross-linked networks that display vibrant color, extreme softness, and intense strain stiffening on par with that of skin tissue. Each of these functional properties is regulated by the structure of one macromolecule, without the need for chemical cross-linking or additives. These materials remain stable under conditions characteristic of internal bodily environments and under ambient conditions, neither swelling in bodily fluids nor drying when exposed to air.</p>

Winter color polymorphisms identify global hot spots for evolutionary rescue from climate change
<p>Maintenance of biodiversity in a rapidly changing climate will depend on the efficacy of evolutionary rescue, whereby population declines due to abrupt environmental change are reversed by shifts in genetically driven adaptive traits. However, a lack of traits known to be under direct selection by anthropogenic climate change has limited the incorporation of evolutionary processes into global conservation efforts. In 21 vertebrate species, some individuals undergo a seasonal color molt from summer brown to winter white as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">camouflag</span></strong>e against snow, whereas other individuals remain brown. Seasonal snow duration is decreasing globally, and fitness is lower for winter white animals on snowless backgrounds. Based on 2713 georeferenced samples of known winter coat color—from eight species across trophic levels—we identify environmentally driven clinal gradients in winter coat color, including polymorphic zones where winter brown and white morphs co-occur. These polymorphic zones, underrepresented by existing global protected area networks, indicate hot spots for evolutionary rescue in a changing climate.</p>

The Global Virome Project
<p>Outbreaks of novel and deadly viruses highlight global vulnerability to emerging diseases, with many having massive health and economic impacts. Our adaptive toolkit—based largely on vaccines and therapeutics—is often ineffective because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">countermeasur</span></strong>e development can be outpaced by the speed of novel viral emergence and spread. Following each outbreak, the public health community bemoans a lack of prescience, but after decades of reacting to each event with little focus on mitigation, we remain only marginally better protected against the next epidemic. Our ability to mitigate disease emergence is undermined by our poor understanding of the diversity and ecology of viral threats, and of the drivers of their emergence. We describe a Global Virome Project (GVP) aimed to launch in 2018 that will help identify the bulk of this viral threat and provide timely data for public health interventions against future pandemics.</p>

Atomic structure of the human cytomegalovirus capsid with its securing tegument layer of pp150
<p>Herpesviruses possess a genome-pressurized capsid. The 235-kilobase genome of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is by far the largest of any herpesvirus, yet it has been unclear how its capsid, which is similar in size to those of other herpesviruses, is stabilized. Here we report a HCMV atomic structure consisting of the herpesvirus-conserved capsid proteins MCP, Tri1, Tri2, and SCP and the HCMV-specific tegument protein pp150—totaling ~4000 molecules and 62 different conformers. MCPs manifest as a complex of insertions around a bacteriophage HK97 gp5–like domain, which gives rise to three classes of capsid floor–defining interactions; triplexes, composed of two “embracing” Tri2 conformers and a “third-wheeling” Tri1, fasten the capsid floor. HCMV-specific strategies include using hexon channels to accommodate the genome and pp150 helix bundles to secure the capsid via cysteine tetrad–to-SCP interactions. Our structure should inform rational design of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">countermeasur</span></strong>es against HCMV, other herpesviruses, and even HIV/AIDS.</p>

Turnip Mosaic Virus Counteracts Selective Autophagy of the Viral Silencing Suppressor HCpro<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway and has emerged as a key mechanism of antiviral immunity in metazoans, including the selective elimination of viral components. In turn, some animal viruses are able to escape and modulate autophagy for enhanced pathogenicity. Whether host autophagic responses and viral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">countermeasur</span></strong>es play similar roles in plant-virus interactions is not well understood. Here, we have identified selective autophagy as antiviral pathway during plant infection with turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), a positive-stranded RNA potyvirus. We show that the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 suppresses viral accumulation by targeting the viral RNA silencing suppressor helper-component proteinase (HCpro), presumably in association with virus-induced RNA granules. Intriguingly, TuMV seems to antagonize NBR1-dependent autophagy during infection by the activity of distinct viral proteins, thereby limiting its antiviral capacity. We also found that NBR1-independent bulk autophagy prevents premature plant death, thus extending the lifespan of virus reservoirs and particle production. Together, our study highlights a conserved role of selective autophagy in antiviral immunity and suggests the evolvement of viral protein functions to inhibit autophagy processes, despite a potential trade-off in host survival.</p>

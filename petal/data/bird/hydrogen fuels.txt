Photoredox-catalyzed deuteration and tritiation of pharmaceutical compounds
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deuterium</span></strong>- and tritium-labeled pharmaceutical compounds are pivotal diagnostic tools in drug discovery research, providing vital information about the biological fate of drugs and drug metabolites. Herein we demonstrate that a photoredox-mediated hydrogen atom transfer protocol can efficiently and selectively install <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deuterium</span></strong> (D) and tritium (T) at α-amino sp<sup>3</sup> carbon-hydrogen bonds in a single step, using isotopically labeled water (D<sub>2</sub>O or T<sub>2</sub>O) as the source of hydrogen isotope. In this context, we also report a convenient synthesis of T<sub>2</sub>O from T<sub>2</sub>, providing access to high-specific-activity T<sub>2</sub>O. This protocol has been successfully applied to the high incorporation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deuterium</span></strong> and tritium in 18 drug molecules, which meet the requirements for use in ligand-binding assays and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies.</p>

Quantum control of molecular collisions at 1 kelvin
<p>Measurement of vector correlations in molecular scattering is an indispensable tool for mapping out interaction potentials. In a coexpanded supersonic beam, we have studied the rotationally inelastic process wherein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deuterium</span></strong> hydride (HD) (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) collides with molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deuterium</span></strong> (D<sub>2</sub>) to form HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 1), where <i>v</i> and <i>j</i> are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, respectively. HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) was prepared by Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage, with its bond axis aligned preferentially parallel or perpendicular to the lab-fixed relative velocity. The coexpansion brought the collision temperature down to 1 kelvin, restricting scattering to s and p partial waves. Scattering angular distributions showed a dramatic stereodynamic preference (~3:1) for perpendicular versus parallel alignment. The four-vector correlation measured between the initial and final velocities and the initial and final rotational angular momentum vectors of HD provides insight into the strong anisotropic forces present in the collision process.</p>

The Src family kinase Fgr is a transforming oncoprotein that functions independently of SH3-SH2 domain regulation
<p>Fgr is a member of the Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, which are overexpressed and constitutively active in many human cancers. Fgr expression is restricted to myeloid hematopoietic cells and is markedly increased in a subset of bone marrow samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we investigated the oncogenic potential of Fgr using Rat-2 fibroblasts that do not express the kinase. Expression of either wild-type or regulatory tail-mutant constructs of Fgr promoted cellular transformation (inferred from colony formation in soft agar), which was accompanied by phosphorylation of the Fgr activation loop, suggesting that the kinase domain of Fgr functions independently of regulation by its noncatalytic SH3-SH2 region. Unlike other family members, recombinant Fgr was not activated by SH3-SH2 domain ligands. However, hydrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deuterium</span></strong> exchange mass spectrometry data suggested that the regulatory SH3 and SH2 domains packed against the back of the kinase domain in a Src-like manner. Sequence alignment showed that the activation loop of Fgr was distinct from that of all other Src family members, with proline rather than alanine at the +2 position relative to the activation loop tyrosine. Substitution of the activation loop of Fgr with the sequence from Src partially inhibited kinase activity and suppressed colony formation. Last, Fgr expression enhanced the sensitivity of human myeloid progenitor cells to the cytokine GM-CSF. Because its kinase domain is not sensitive to SH3-SH2–mediated control, simple overexpression of Fgr without mutation may contribute to oncogenic transformation in AML and other blood cancers.</p>

Insulator-metal transition in dense fluid deuterium
<p>Dense fluid metallic hydrogen occupies the interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and many extrasolar planets, where pressures reach millions of atmospheres. Planetary structure models must describe accurately the transition from the outer molecular envelopes to the interior metallic regions. We report optical measurements of dynamically compressed fluid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deuterium</span></strong> to 600 gigapascals (GPa) that reveal an increasing refractive index, the onset of absorption of visible light near 150 GPa, and a transition to metal-like reflectivity (exceeding 30%) near 200 GPa, all at temperatures below 2000 kelvin. Our measurements and analysis address existing discrepancies between static and dynamic experiments for the insulator-metal transition in dense fluid hydrogen isotopes. They also provide new benchmarks for the theoretical calculations used to construct planetary models.</p>

Defibrillation of soft porous metal-organic frameworks with electric fields
<p>Gas transport through metal-organic framework membranes (MOFs) was switched in situ by applying an external electric field (E-field). The switching of gas permeation upon E-field polarization could be explained by the structural transformation of the zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 into polymorphs with more rigid lattices. Permeation measurements under a direct-current E-field poling of 500 volts per millimeter showed reversibly controlled switching of the ZIF-8 into polar polymorphs, which was confirmed by x-ray diffraction and ab initio calculations. The stiffening of the lattice causes a reduction in gas transport through the membrane and sharpens the molecular sieving capability. Dielectric spectroscopy, polarization, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deuterium</span></strong> nuclear magnetic resonance studies revealed low-frequency resonances of ZIF-8 that we attribute to lattice flexibility and linker movement. Upon E-field polarization, we observed a defibrillation of the different lattice motions.</p>

Direct observation of individual hydrogen atoms at trapping sites in a ferritic steel
<p>The design of atomic-scale microstructural traps to limit the diffusion of hydrogen is one key strategy in the development of hydrogen-embrittlement–resistant materials. In the case of bearing steels, an effective trapping mechanism may be the incorporation of finely dispersed V-Mo-Nb carbides in a ferrite matrix. First, we charged a ferritic steel with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deuterium</span></strong> by means of electrolytic loading to achieve a high hydrogen concentration. We then immobilized it in the microstructure with a cryogenic transfer protocol before atom probe tomography (APT) analysis. Using APT, we show trapping of hydrogen within the core of these carbides with quantitative composition profiles. Furthermore, with this method the experiment can be feasibly replicated in any APT-equipped laboratory by using a simple cold chain.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Dioxygenase Catalyzes Steroid 16α-Hydroxylation in Steroidal Glycoalkaloid Biosynthesis
<p>Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) are toxic specialized metabolites that are found in the Solanaceae. Potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) contains the SGAs α-solanine and α-chaconine, while tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) contains α-tomatine, all of which are biosynthesized from cholesterol. However, although two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that catalyze the 22- and 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol have been identified, the 16-hydroxylase remains unknown. Feeding with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deuterium</span></strong>-labeled cholesterol indicated that the 16α- and 16β-hydrogen atoms of cholesterol were eliminated to form α-solanine and α-chaconine in potato, while only the 16α-hydrogen atom was eliminated in α-tomatine biosynthesis, suggesting that a single oxidation at C-16 takes place during tomato SGA biosynthesis while a two-step oxidation occurs in potato. Here, we show that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, designated as 16DOX, is involved in SGA biosynthesis. We found that the transcript of potato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>St16DOX</i>) was expressed at high levels in the tuber sprouts, where large amounts of SGAs are accumulated. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant St16DOX protein revealed that St16DOX catalyzes the 16α-hydroxylation of hydroxycholesterols and that (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol was the best substrate among the nine compounds tested. <i>St16DOX</i>-silenced potato plants contained significantly lower levels of SGAs, and a detailed metabolite analysis revealed that they accumulated the glycosides of (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol. Analysis of the tomato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>Sl16DOX</i>) gene gave essentially the same results. These findings clearly indicate that 16DOX is a steroid 16α-hydroxylase that functions in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, <i>St16DOX</i> silencing did not affect potato tuber yield, indicating that <i>16DOX</i> may be a suitable target for controlling toxic SGA levels in potato.</p>

Early Senescence in Older Leaves of Low Nitrate-Grown <i>Atxdh1</i> Uncovers a Role for Purine Catabolism in N Supply
<p>The nitrogen (N)-rich ureides allantoin and allantoate, which are products of purine catabolism, play a role in N delivery in Leguminosae. Here, we examined their role as an N source in nonlegume plants using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants mutated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">xanthin</span></strong>E DEHYDROGENASE1 (AtXDH1), a catalytic bottleneck in purine catabolism. Older leaves of the <i>Atxdh1</i> mutant exhibited early senescence, lower soluble protein, and lower organic N levels as compared with wild-type older leaves when grown with 1 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate but were comparable to the wild type under 5 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate. Similar nitrate-dependent senescence phenotypes were evident in the older leaves of <i>allantoinase</i> (<i>Ataln</i>) and <i>allantoate amidohydrolase</i> (<i>Ataah</i>) mutants, which also are impaired in purine catabolism. Under low-nitrate conditions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">xanthin</span></strong>e accumulated in older leaves of <i>Atxdh1</i>, whereas allantoin accumulated in both older and younger leaves of <i>Ataln</i> but not in wild-type leaves, indicating the remobilization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">xanthin</span></strong>e-degraded products from older to younger leaves. Supporting this notion, ureide transporter expression was enhanced in older leaves of the wild type in low-nitrate as compared with high-nitrate conditions. Elevated transcripts and proteins of AtXDH and AtAAH were detected in low-nitrate-grown wild-type plants, indicating regulation at protein and transcript levels. The higher nitrate reductase activity in <i>Atxdh1</i> leaves compared with wild-type leaves indicated a need for nitrate assimilation products. Together, these results indicate that the absence of remobilized purine-degraded N from older leaves of <i>Atxdh1</i> caused senescence symptoms, a result of higher chloroplastic protein degradation in older leaves of low-nitrate-grown plants.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Daurichromenic Acid Synthase Active in Anti-HIV Biosynthesis
<p>Daurichromenic acid (DCA) synthase catalyzes the oxidative cyclization of grifolic acid to produce DCA, an anti-HIV meroterpenoid isolated from <i>Rhododendron dauricum</i>. We identified a novel cDNA encoding DCA synthase by transcriptome-based screening from young leaves of <i>R. dauricum</i>. The gene coded for a 533-amino acid polypeptide with moderate homologies to flavin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide oxidases from other plants. The primary structure contained an amino-terminal signal peptide and conserved amino acid residues to form bicovalent linkage to the flavin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide isoalloxazine ring at histidine-112 and cysteine-175. In addition, the recombinant DCA synthase, purified from the culture supernatant of transgenic <i>Pichia pastoris</i>, exhibited structural and functional properties as a flavoprotein. The reaction mechanism of DCA synthase characterized herein partly shares a similarity with those of cannabinoid synthases from <i>Cannabis sativa</i>, whereas DCA synthase catalyzes a novel cyclization reaction of the farnesyl moiety of a meroterpenoid natural product of plant origin. Moreover, in this study, we present evidence that DCA is biosynthesized and accumulated specifically in the glandular scales, on the surface of <i>R. dauricum</i> plants, based on various analytical studies at the chemical, biochemical, and molecular levels. The extracellular localization of DCA also was confirmed by a confocal microscopic analysis of its autofluorescence. These data highlight the unique feature of DCA: the final step of biosynthesis is completed in apoplastic space, and it is highly accumulated outside the scale cells.</p>

Nicotinamide Riboside Preserves Cardiac Function in a Mouse Model of Dilated Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial metabolic impairment is a major feature in chronic heart failure. As the major coenzyme in fuel oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and a substrate for enzymes signaling energy stress and oxidative stress response, nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is emerging as a metabolic target in a number of diseases including heart failure. Little is known on the mechanisms regulating homeostasis of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the failing heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To explore possible alterations of NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in the failing heart, we quantified the expression of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes in the human failing heart and in the heart of a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) triggered by Serum Response Factor transcription factor depletion in the heart (SRF<sup>HKO</sup>) or of cardiac hypertrophy triggered by transverse aorta constriction. We studied the impact of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor supplementation on cardiac function in both mouse models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed a 30% loss in levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the murine failing heart of both DCM and transverse aorta constriction mice that was accompanied by a decrease in expression of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme that recycles the nicotinamide precursor, whereas the nicotinamide riboside kinase 2 (NMRK2) that phosphorylates the nicotinamide riboside precursor is increased, to a higher level in the DCM (40-fold) than in transverse aorta constriction (4-fold). This shift was also observed in human failing heart biopsies in comparison with nonfailing controls. We show that the <i>Nmrk2</i> gene is an AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î± responsive gene that is activated by energy stress and NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Nicotinamide riboside efficiently rescues NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis in response to FK866-mediated inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and stimulates glycolysis in cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, we show that nicotinamide riboside supplementation in food attenuates the development of heart failure in mice, more robustly in DCM, and partially after transverse aorta constriction, by stabilizing myocardial NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the failing heart. Nicotinamide riboside treatment also robustly increases the myocardial levels of 3 metabolites, nicotinic acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide, methylnicotinamide, and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, that can be used as validation biomarkers for the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data show that nicotinamide riboside, the most energy-efficient among NAD precursors, could be useful for treatment of heart failure, notably in the context of DCM, a disease with few therapeutic options.</p></sec>

Hippocampal mGluR1-dependent long-term potentiation requires NAADP-mediated acidic store Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling
<p>Acidic organelles, such as endosomes and lysosomes, store Ca<sup>2+</sup> that is released in response to intracellular increases in the second messenger nicotinic acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). In neurons, NAADP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling contribute to synaptic plasticity, a process of activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) [or, alternatively, long-term depression (LTD)] of synaptic strength and neuronal transmission that is critical for neuronal function and memory formation. We explored the function of and mechanisms regulating acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup> store signaling in murine hippocampal neurons. We found that metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) was coupled to NAADP signaling that elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from acidic stores. In turn, this released Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated mGluR1-dependent LTP by transiently inhibiting SK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels, possibly through the activation of protein phosphatase 2A. Genetically removing two-pore channels (TPCs), which are endolysosomal-specific ion channels, switched the polarity of plasticity from LTP to LTD, indicating the importance of specific receptor store coupling and providing mechanistic insight into how mGluR1 can produce both synaptic potentiation and synaptic depression.</p>

mTORC1 controls lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the two-pore channel TPC2
<p>Two-pore segment channel 2 (TPC2) is a ubiquitously expressed, lysosomally targeted ion channel that aids in terminating autophagy and is inhibited upon its association with mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). It is controversial whether TPC2 mediates lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release or selectively conducts Na<sup>+</sup> and whether the binding of nicotinic acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) or phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>] is required for the activity of this ion channel. We show that TPC2 is required for intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in response to NAADP or to mTOR inhibition by rapamycin. In pulmonary arterial myocytes, rapamycin and NAADP evoked global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that were blocked by depletion of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. Preincubation of cells with high concentrations of rapamycin resulted in desensitization and blocked NAADP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Moreover, rapamycin and NAADP did not evoke discernable Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in myocytes derived from <i>Tpcn2</i> knockout mice, which showed normal responses to other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mobilizing signals. In HEK293 cells stably overexpressing human TPC2, shRNA-mediated knockdown of mTOR blocked rapamycin- and NAADP-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Confocal imaging of a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator fused to TPC2 demonstrated that rapamycin-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals localized to lysosomes and were in close proximity to TPC2. Therefore, inactivation of mTOR may activate TPC2 and consequently lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</p>

The lysine deacetylase Sirtuin 1 modulates the localization and function of the Notch1 receptor in regulatory T cells
<p>The ability to tune cellular functions in response to nutrient availability has important consequences for immune homeostasis. The activity of the receptor Notch in regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, which suppress the functions of effector T cells, is indispensable for T<sub>reg</sub> cell survival under conditions of diminished nutrient supply. Anti-apoptotic signaling induced by the Notch1 intracellular domain (NIC) originates from the cytoplasm and is spatially decoupled from the nuclear, largely transcriptional functions of NIC. We showed that Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), which is an NAD<sup>+</sup> (nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide)âdependent lysine deacetylase that inhibits NIC-dependent gene transcription, stabilized NIC proximal to the plasma membrane to promote the survival and function of activated T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Sirt1 was required for NIC-dependent protection from apoptosis in cell lines but not for the activity of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. In addition, a variant NIC protein in which four lysines were mutated to arginines (NIC4KR) retained anti-apoptotic activity, but was not regulated by Sirt1, and reconstituted the functions of nonnuclear NIC in Notch1-deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Loss of Sirt1 compromised T<sub>reg</sub> cell survival, resulting in antigen-induced T cell proliferation and inflammation in two mouse models. Thus, the Sirt1-Notch interaction may constitute an important checkpoint that tunes noncanonical Notch1 signaling.</p>

Cytosine, but not adenine, base editors induce genome-wide off-target mutations in rice
<p>Cytosine and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e base editors (CBEs and ABEs) are promising new tools for achieving the precise genetic changes required for disease treatment and trait improvement. However, genome-wide and unbiased analyses of their off-target effects in vivo are still lacking. Our whole-genome sequencing analysis of rice plants treated with the third-generation base editor (BE3), high-fidelity BE3 (HF1-BE3), or ABE revealed that BE3 and HF1-BE3, but not ABE, induce substantial genome-wide off-target mutations, which are mostly the CâT type of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and appear to be enriched in genic regions. Notably, treatment of rice with BE3 or HF1-BE3 in the absence of single-guide RNA also results in the rise of genome-wide SNVs. Thus, the base-editing unit of BE3 or HF1-BE3 needs to be optimized in order to attain high fidelity.</p>

Cytosine base editor generates substantial off-target single-nucleotide variants in mouse embryos
<p>Genome editing holds promise for correcting pathogenic mutations. However, it is difficult to determine off-target effects of editing due to single-nucleotide polymorphism in individuals. Here we developed a method named GOTI (genome-wide off-target analysis by two-cell embryo injection) to detect off-target mutations by editing one blastomere of two-cell mouse embryos using either CRISPR-Cas9 or base editors. Comparison of the whole-genome sequences of progeny cells of edited and nonedited blastomeres at embryonic day 14.5 showed that off-target single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were rare in embryos edited by CRISPR-Cas9 or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e base editor, with a frequency close to the spontaneous mutation rate. By contrast, cytosine base editing induced SNVs at more than 20-fold higher frequencies, requiring a solution to address its fidelity.</p>

Direct stimulation of NADP<sup>+</sup> synthesis through Akt-mediated phosphorylation of NAD kinase
<p>Nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide phosphate (NADP<sup>+</sup>) is essential for producing NADPH, the primary cofactor for reductive metabolism. We find that growth factor signaling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)âAkt pathway induces acute synthesis of NADP<sup>+</sup> and NADPH. Akt phosphorylates NAD kinase (NADK), the sole cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of NADP<sup>+</sup> from NAD<sup>+</sup> (the oxidized form of NADH), on three serine residues (Ser<sup>44</sup>, Ser<sup>46</sup>, and Ser<sup>48</sup>) within an amino-terminal domain. This phosphorylation stimulates NADK activity both in cells and directly in vitro, thereby increasing NADP<sup>+</sup> production. A rare isoform of NADK (isoform 3) lacking this regulatory region exhibits constitutively increased activity. These data indicate that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of NADK stimulates its activity to increase NADP<sup>+</sup> production through relief of an autoinhibitory function inherent to its amino terminus.</p>

Adaptations of an ancient modular machine

In combination with high resolution structures of respiratory complex I from bacteria (<i>2</i>), mitochondria (<i>3</i>â<i>5</i>), and membrane bound hydrogenase (<i>6</i>), it is now possible to trace the modular evolution and functional adaptations of the complex I superfamily at the atomic level.</p>

Semisynthetic sensor proteins enable metabolic assays at the point of care
<p>Monitoring metabolites at the point of care could improve the diagnosis and management of numerous diseases. Yet for most metabolites, such assays are not available.

The metabolite is oxidized by nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide phosphate, and the sensor changes color in the presence of the reduced cofactor, enabling metabolite quantification with the use of a digital camera. The approach makes any metabolite that can be oxidized by the cofactor a candidate for quantitative point-of-care assays, as shown for phenylalanine, glucose, and glutamate. Phenylalanine blood levels of phenylketonuria patients were analyzed at the point of care within minutes with only 0.5 microliters of blood.

Metabolic regulation of transcription through compartmentalized NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis
<p>NAD<sup>+</sup> (nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide in its oxidized state) is an essential molecule for a variety of physiological processes. It is synthesized in distinct subcellular compartments by three different synthases (NMNAT-1, -2, and -3). We found that compartmentalized NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis by NMNATs integrates glucose metabolism and adipogenic transcription during adipocyte differentiation. Adipogenic signaling rapidly induces cytoplasmic NMNAT-2, which competes with nuclear NMNAT-1 for the common substrate, nicotinamide mononucleotide, leading to a precipitous reduction in nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> levels. This inhibits the catalytic activity of poly[adenosine diphosphate (ADP)âribose] polymeraseâ1 (PARP-1), a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzyme that represses adipogenic transcription by ADP-ribosylating the adipogenic transcription factor C/EBPÎ². Reversal of PARP-1âmediated repression by NMNAT-2âmediated nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in response to adipogenic signals drives adipogenesis. Thus, compartmentalized NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis functions as an integrator of cellular metabolism and signal-dependent transcriptional programs.</p>

Metabolite regulates differentiation
<p>Cellular differentiation involves dynamic epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic remodeling as cells transition to a new identity. Evidence is mounting that metabolism and gene regulation are intimately linked, with changes in metabolite availability modulating or even triggering gene transcription. One way that metabolites regulate gene expression is as substrates of enzymes that carry out posttranslational modification of transcription factors and histones. Such metabolites likely have distinct biological roles in different compartments of the cell, and in particular within the nucleus (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). Yet, the extent to which the nucleus is a separate metabolic compartment from the cytosol and the mechanisms by which nuclear metabolite levels affect expression of specific genes have remained largely unknown. On page 618 of this issue, Ryu <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that compartmentalized synthesis of the metabolite oxidized nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), regulates adipocyte differentiation, a process that is essential for metabolic health, through transcriptional control.</p>

Sterilizing immunity in the lung relies on targeting fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death
<p>Humans inhale mold conidia daily and typically experience lifelong asymptomatic clearance. Conidial germination into tissue-invasive hyphae can occur in individuals with defects in myeloid function, although the mechanism of myeloid cellâmediated immune surveillance remains unclear. By monitoring fungal physiology in vivo, we demonstrate that lung neutrophils trigger programmed cell death with apoptosis-like features in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia, the most prevalent human mold pathogen. An antiapoptotic protein, AfBIR1, opposes this process by inhibiting fungal caspase activation and DNA fragmentation in the murine lung. Genetic and pharmacologic studies indicate that AfBIR1 expression and activity underlie conidial susceptibility to NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase-dependent killing and, in turn, host susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis. Immune surveillance exploits a fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death pathway to maintain sterilizing immunity in the lung.</p>

<p>NAD<sup>+</sup> (oxidized form of NAD:nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide)âreducing soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase (SH) is phylogenetically related to NADH (reduced form of NAD<sup>+</sup>):quinone oxidoreductase (complex I), but the geometrical arrangements of the subunits and FeâS clusters are unclear. Here, we describe the crystal structures of SH in the oxidized and reduced states. The cluster arrangement is similar to that of complex I, but the subunits orientation is not, which supports the hypothesis that subunits evolved as prebuilt modules. The oxidized active site includes a six-coordinate Ni, which is unprecedented for hydrogenases, whose coordination geometry would prevent O<sub>2</sub> from approaching. In the reduced state showing the normal active site structure without a physiological electron acceptor, the flavin mononucleotide cofactor is dissociated, which may be caused by the oxidation state change of nearby FeâS clusters and may suppress production of reactive oxygen species.</p>

An algal photoenzyme converts fatty acids to hydrocarbons
<p>Although many organisms capture or respond to sunlight, few enzymes are known to be driven by light. Among these are DNA photolyases and the photosynthetic reaction centers. Here, we show that the microalga <i>Chlorella variabilis</i> NC64A harbors a photoenzyme that acts in lipid metabolism. This enzyme belongs to an algae-specific clade of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family and catalyzes the decarboxylation of free fatty acids to n-alkanes or -alkenes in response to blue light. Crystal structure of the protein reveals a fatty acidâbinding site in a hydrophobic tunnel leading to the light-capturing flavin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor.

A conserved NAD<sup>+</sup> binding pocket that regulates protein-protein interactions during aging
<p>DNA repair is essential for life, yet its efficiency declines with age for reasons that are unclear. Numerous proteins possess Nudix homology domains (NHDs) that have no known function. We show that NHDs are NAD<sup>+</sup> (oxidized form of nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide) binding domains that regulate protein-protein interactions. The binding of NAD<sup>+</sup> to the NHD domain of DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) prevents it from inhibiting PARP1 [poly(adenosine diphosphateâribose) polymerase], a critical DNA repair protein. As mice age and NAD<sup>+</sup> concentrations decline, DBC1 is increasingly bound to PARP1, causing DNA damage to accumulate, a process rapidly reversed by restoring the abundance of NAD<sup>+</sup>. Thus, NAD<sup>+</sup> directly regulates protein-protein interactions, the modulation of which may protect against cancer, radiation, and aging.</p>

Aggregation of the Whi3 protein, not loss of heterochromatin, causes sterility in old yeast cells
<p>In yeast, heterochromatin silencing is reported to decline in aging mother cells, causing sterility in old cells. This process is thought to reflect a decrease in the activity of the NAD<sup>+ </sup>(oxidized nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide)âdependent deacetylase Sir2. We tested whether Sir2 becomes nonfunctional gradually or precipitously during aging. Unexpectedly, silencing of the heterochromatic <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i> loci was not lost during aging. Old cells could initiate a mating response; however, they were less sensitive to mating pheromone than were young cells because of age-dependent aggregation of Whi3, an RNA-binding protein controlling S-phase entry. Removing the polyglutamine domain of Whi3 restored the pheromone sensitivity of old cells. We propose that aging phenotypes previously attributed to loss of heterochromatin silencing are instead caused by aggregation of the Whi3 cell cycle regulator.</p>

Glycolysis plays an important role in energy transfer from the base to the distal end of the flagellum in mouse sperm
<p>Many studies have been conducted to elucidate the relationship between energy metabolic pathways (glycolysis and respiration) and flagellar motility in mammalian sperm, but the contribution of glycolysis to sperm motility has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed detailed analysis of mouse sperm flagellar motility for further understanding of the contribution of glycolysis to mammalian sperm motility. Mouse sperm maintained vigorous motility in the presence of substrates either for glycolysis or for respiration. By contrast, inhibition of glycolysis by alpha-chlorohydrine caused a significant decrease in the bend angle of the flagellar bending wave, sliding velocity of outer doublet microtubules and ATP content even in the presence of respiratory substrates (pyruvate or Î²-hydroxybutyrate). The decrease of flagellar bend angle and sliding velocity are prominent in the distal part of the flagellum, indicating that glycolysis inhibition caused the decrease in ATP concentration threrein. These results suggest that glycolysis potentially acts as a spatial ATP buffering system, transferring energy (ATP) synthesized by respiration at the mitochondria located in the basal part of the flagellum to the distal part. In order to validate that glycolytic enzymes can transfer high energy phosphoryls, we calculated intraflagellar concentration profiles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e nucleotides along the flagellum by computer simulation analysis. The result demonstrated the involvement of glycolysis for maintaining the ATP concentration at the tip of the flagellum. It is likely that glycolysis plays a key role in energy homeostasis in mouse sperm not only through ATP production but also through energy transfer.</p>

We characterized the organismal, bioenergetic and molecular phenotype of <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies then tested strategies to compensate the mutant phenotype. In addition to developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures, <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> flies have an impaired response to sound, defective male courtship, female sterility and curtailed lifespan. These phenotypes, excluding the latter two, are shared with the mitoribosomal protein S12 mutant, <i>tko<sup>25t</sup></i>. Mitochondria from <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults showed a decreased respiratory control ratio and downregulation of cytochrome oxidase. <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> adults exhibited ATP depletion, lactate accumulation and changes in gene expression that were consistent with a metabolic shift towards glycolysis, characterized by activation of lactate dehydrogenase and anaplerotic pathways. Females also showed downregulation of many genes that are required for oogenesis, and their eggs, although fertilized, failed to develop to the larval stages. The <i>sesB<sup>1</sup></i> phenotypes of developmental delay and mechanical-stress-induced seizures were alleviated by an altered mitochondrial DNA background. Female sterility was substantially rescued by somatic expression of alternative oxidase (AOX) from the sea squirt <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>, whereas AOX did not alleviate developmental delay. Our findings illustrate the potential of different therapeutic strategies for ANT-linked diseases, based on alleviating metabolic stress.</p>

We hypothesized that cell-specific actions of Smad3 regulate repair and remodeling in the infarcted myocardium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To dissect cell-specific Smad3 actions in myocardial infarction, we generated mice with Smad3 loss in activated fibroblasts or cardiomyocytes. Cardiac function was assessed after reperfused or nonreperfused infarction using echocardiography. The effects of cell-specific Smad3 loss on the infarcted heart were studied using histological studies, assessment of protein, and gene expression levels. In vitro, we studied Smad-dependent and Smad-independent actions in isolated cardiac fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mice with fibroblast-specific Smad3 loss had accentuated adverse remodeling after reperfused infarction and exhibited an increased incidence of late rupture after nonreperfused infarction. The consequences of fibroblast-specific Smad3 loss were not a result of effects on acute infarct size but were associated with unrestrained fibroblast proliferation, impaired scar remodeling, reduced fibroblast-derived collagen synthesis, and perturbed alignment of myofibroblast arrays in the infarct. Polarized light microscopy in Sirius redâstained sections demonstrated that the changes in fibroblast morphology were associated with perturbed organization of the collagenous matrix in the infarcted area. In contrast, Î±-smooth muscle actin expression by infarct myofibroblasts was not affected by Smad3 loss. Smad3 critically regulated fibroblast function, activating integrin-mediated nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidaseâ2 (NOX-2) expression. Smad3 loss in cardiomyocytes attenuated remodeling and dysfunction after infarction. Cardiomyocyte-specific Smad3 loss did not affect acute infarct size but was associated with attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the remodeling myocardium, accompanied by decreased myocardial NOX-2 levels, reduced nitrosative stress, and lower matrix metalloproteinaseâ2 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In healing myocardial infarction, myofibroblast- and cardiomyocyte-specific activation of Smad3 has contrasting functional outcomes that may involve activation of an integrin/reactive oxygen axis.</p></sec>

Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase Promotes Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling and Is a Therapeutic Target in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a severe and progressive disease, a hallmark of which is pulmonary vascular remodeling. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a cytozyme that regulates intracellular nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide levels and cellular redox state, regulates histone deacetylases, promotes cell proliferation, and inhibits apoptosis. We hypothesized that NAMPT promotes pulmonary vascular remodeling and that inhibition of NAMPT could attenuate pulmonary hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Plasma, mRNA, and protein levels of NAMPT were measured in the lungs and isolated pulmonary artery endothelial cells from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and in the lungs of rodent models of pulmonary hypertension. <i>Nampt</i><sup>+/â</sup> mice were exposed to 10% hypoxia and room air for 4 weeks, and the preventive and therapeutic effects of NAMPT inhibition were tested in the monocrotaline and Sugen hypoxia models of pulmonary hypertension. The effects of NAMPT activity on proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and calcium signaling were tested in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma and mRNA and protein levels of NAMPT were increased in the lungs and isolated pulmonary artery endothelial cells from patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, as well as in lungs of rodent models of pulmonary hypertension. <i>Nampt</i><sup>+/â</sup> mice were protected from hypoxia-mediated pulmonary hypertension. NAMPT activity promoted human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation via a paracrine effect. In addition, recombinant NAMPT stimulated human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation via enhancement of store-operated calcium entry by enhancing expression of Orai2 and STIM2. Last, inhibition of NAMPT activity attenuated monocrotaline and Sugen hypoxiaâinduced pulmonary hypertension in rats.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data provide evidence that NAMPT plays a role in pulmonary vascular remodeling and that its inhibition could be a potential therapeutic target for pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p></sec>

Normalization of NAD<sup>+</sup> Redox Balance as a Therapy for Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Impairments of mitochondrial function in the heart are linked intricately to the development of heart failure, but there is no therapy for mitochondrial dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed the reduced/oxidized ratio of nicotinamide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adenin</span></strong>e dinucleotide (NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio) and protein acetylation in the failing heart. Proteome and acetylome analyses were followed by docking calculation, mutagenesis, and mitochondrial calcium uptake assays to determine the functional role of specific acetylation sites. The therapeutic effects of normalizing mitochondrial protein acetylation by expanding the NAD<sup>+</sup> pool also were tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Increased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> and protein hyperacetylation, previously observed in genetic models of defective mitochondrial function, also are present in human failing hearts as well as in mouse hearts with pathologic hypertrophy. Elevation of NAD<sup>+</sup> levels by stimulating the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway suppressed mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation and cardiac hypertrophy, and improved cardiac function in responses to stresses. Acetylome analysis identified a subpopulation of mitochondrial proteins that was sensitive to changes in the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. Hyperacetylation of mitochondrial malate-aspartate shuttle proteins impaired the transport and oxidation of cytosolic NADH in the mitochondria, resulting in altered cytosolic redox state and energy deficiency. Furthermore, acetylation of oligomycin-sensitive conferring protein at lysine-70 in adenosine triphosphate synthase complex promoted its interaction with cyclophilin D, and sensitized the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Both could be alleviated by normalizing the NAD<sup>+</sup> redox balance either genetically or pharmacologically.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We show that mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation due to NAD<sup>+</sup> redox imbalance contributes to the pathologic remodeling of the heart via 2 distinct mechanisms. Our preclinical data demonstrate a clear benefit of normalizing NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> imbalance in the failing hearts. These findings have a high translational potential as the pharmacologic strategy of increasing NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors are feasible in humans.</p></sec>

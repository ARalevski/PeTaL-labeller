An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other monatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Large-amplitude transfer motion of hydrated excess protons mapped by ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy
<p>Solvat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and transport of excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s in aqueous systems play a fundamental role in acid-base chemistry and biochemical processes. We mapped ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> excurs<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfer coordinate by means of two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al infrared spectroscopy, both in bulk water and in a Zundel cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup> motif selectively prepared in acetonitrile. Electric fields from the environment and stochastic hydrogen bond mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s induce fluctuat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> double-minimum potential. Within the lifetime of a particular hydrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> geometry, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> explores a multitude of posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s on a sub-100-femtosecond time scale. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfer vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is strongly damped by its 20- to 40-femtosecond populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> decay. Our results suggest a central role of Zundel-like geometries in aqueous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> solvat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and transport.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.

Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb).

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state.

Risk factors for wear-related failures after hip resurfacing in patients with a low contact patch to rim distance
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A contact patch to rim (CPR) distance of < 10 mm has been   associated with edge-loading and excessive wear. However, not all   arthroplasties with a low CPR distance show problems with wear.

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction
<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair. The dynamic, reversible format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multinuclear sites from mobilized single atoms represents a distinct phenomenon that falls outside the convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al boundaries of a heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst.</p>

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

Direct measurements of two-way wave-particle energy transfer in a collisionless space plasma

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Complete steric exclusion of ions and proton transport through confined monolayer water
<p>It has long been an aspirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al goal to create artificial structures that allow fast permeat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of water but reject even the smallest hydrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, replicating the feat achieved by nature in protein channels (e.g., aquaporins). Despite recent progress in creating nanoscale pores and capillaries, these structures still remain distinctly larger than protein channels. We report capillaries made by effectively extracting one atomic plane from bulk crystals, which leaves a two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al slit of a few angstroms in height. Water moves through these capillaries with little resistance, whereas no permeat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> could be detected even for such small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s as Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>.

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings

Energy powerhouses of cells come into focus
<p>In every kingdom of life, rotary adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthases and adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) play key roles in cellular energy generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and release processes. In mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria, F-type (F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>) ATP synthases synthesize ATP using energy from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> gradient. They are also able to perform the reverse process, generating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> gradients by ATP hydrolysis. The related V-type (V<sub>1</sub>V<sub>o</sub>) ATPases have similar structures and serve as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> pumps. Two articles in this issue report structures of membrane-embedded ATP synthases from yeast mitochondria [Srivastava <i>et al.</i>, page 619, (<i>1</i>)] and spinach chloroplasts [Hahn <i>et al.</i>, page 620, (<i>2</i>)]. Together with other recent structures, these articles define core design principles of rotary ATP synthases and ATPases but also highlight organism-specific differences.</p>

Toward an optically controlled brain

<p>Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase produces the majority of ATP in eukaryotic cells, and its dimerizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is necessary to create the inner membrane folds, or cristae, characteristic of mitochondria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> translocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> through the membrane-embedded F<sub>O</sub> reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> turns the rotor that drives ATP synthesis in the soluble F<sub>1</sub> reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Although crystal structures of the F<sub>1</sub> reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> have illustrated how this rotat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> leads to ATP synthesis, understanding how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> translocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> produces the rotat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> has been impeded by the lack of an experimental atomic model for the F<sub>O</sub> reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structure of the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> complex from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> at a resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of 3.6 angstroms. The structure clarifies how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s travel through the complex, how the complex dimerizes, and how the dimers bend the membrane to produce cristae.</p>

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s approaching the size of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and water molecules. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, molecular separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Spectroscopic snapshots of the proton-transfer mechanism in water
<p>The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> mobility in water as a sequence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfers along a hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) network. However, the vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk water. Here we report how the much simpler vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al spectra of cold, composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-selected heavy water clusters, D<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>, can be exploited to capture clear markers that encode the collective react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> coordinate along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-transfer event. By complexing the solvated hydronium “Eigen” cluster [D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>] with increasingly strong H-bond acceptor molecules (D<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO, and D<sub>2</sub>O), we are able to track the frequency of every O-D stretch vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the complex as the transferring hydron is incrementally pulled from the central hydronium to a neighboring water molecule.</p>

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental quest<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by using extensive laboratory measurements of rates of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and a comparison with atmospheric observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s show that nearly all nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to sulfuric acid. A considerable fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> involves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, but the relatively weak dependence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s indicates that for the processes studied, variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmic ray</span></strong> intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in the present-day atmosphere.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model of the react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the model under different experimental condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s suggested that there are strong interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between ATP synthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force was highly regulated by the concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force under condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> current induced by muscarinic stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and distinct current–voltage relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with K<sup>+</sup>-free solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Structural insight into precursor tRNA processing by yeast ribonuclease P
<p>Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a universal ribozyme responsible for processing the 5′-leader of pre–transfer RNA (pre-tRNA). Here, we report the 3.5-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structures of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> RNase P alone and in complex with pre-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>. The protein components form a hook-shaped architecture that wraps around the RNA and stabilizes RNase P into a “measuring device” with two fixed anchors that recognize the L-shaped pre-tRNA. A universally conserved uridine nucleobase and phosphate backbone in the catalytic center together with the scissile phosphate and the O3′ leaving group of pre-tRNA jointly coordinate two catalytic magnesium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Binding of pre-tRNA induces a conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al change in the catalytic center that is required for catalysis. Moreover, simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> analysis suggests a two-metal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> S<sub>N</sub>2 react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathway of pre-tRNA cleavage. These results not only reveal the architecture of yeast RNase P but also provide a molecular basis of how the 5′-leader of pre-tRNA is processed by eukaryotic RNase P.</p>

Glutamate triggers long-distance, calcium-based plant defense signaling
<p>Animals require rapid, long-range molecular signaling networks to integrate sensing and response throughout their bodies. The amino acid glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system, facilitating long-range informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> exchange via activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of glutamate receptor channels. Similarly, plants sense local signals, such as herbivore attack, and transmit this informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> throughout the plant body to rapidly activate defense responses in undamaged parts. Here we show that glutamate is a wound signal in plants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels of the <i>GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR–LIKE</i> family act as sensors that convert this signal into an increase in intracellular calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> that propagates to distant organs, where defense responses are then induced.</p>

A designed heme-[4Fe-4S] metalloenzyme catalyzes sulfite reduction like the native enzyme
<p>Multielectron redox react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s often require multicofactor metalloenzymes to facilitate coupled electron and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> movement, but it is challenging to design artificial enzymes to catalyze these important react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, owing to their structural and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al complexity. We report a designed heteronuclear heme-[4Fe-4S] cofactor in cytochrome <i>c</i> peroxidase as a structural and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al model of the enzyme sulfite reductase.

<p>At the core of the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> radius puzzle” is a four–standard deviat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> discrepancy between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> root-mean-square charge radii (<i>r</i><sub>p</sub>) determined from the regular hydrogen (H) and the muonic hydrogen (µp) atoms. Using a cryogenic beam of H atoms, we measured the 2S-4P transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> frequency in H, yielding the values of the Rydberg constant <i>R</i><sub>∞</sub> = 10973731.568076(96) per meter<sup></sup>and <i>r</i><sub>p</sub> = 0.8335(95) femtometer. Our <i>r</i><sub>p</sub> value is 3.3 combined standard deviat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s smaller than the previous H world data, but in good agreement with the µp value. We motivate an asymmetric fit funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, which eliminates line shifts from quantum interference of neighboring atomic resonances.</p>

Three-dimensional holey-graphene/niobia composite architectures for ultrahigh-rate energy storage
<p>Nanostructured materials have shown extraordinary promise for electrochemical energy storage but are usually limited to electrodes with rather low mass loading (~1 milligram per square centimeter) because of the increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in thicker electrodes. We report the design of a three-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al (3D) holey-graphene/niobia (Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) composite for ultrahigh-rate energy storage at practical levels of mass loading (>10 milligrams per square centimeter). The highly interconnected graphene network in the 3D architecture provides excellent electron transport properties, and its hierarchical porous structure facilitates rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport. By systematically tailoring the porosity in the holey graphene backbone, charge transport in the composite architecture is optimized to deliver high areal capacity and high-rate capability at high mass loading, which represents a critical step forward toward practical applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Cryo-EM structures of the triheteromeric NMDA receptor and its allosteric modulation
<p><i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are heterotetrameric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels assembled as diheteromeric or triheteromeric complexes. Here, we report structures of the triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B receptor in the absence or presence of the GluN2B-specific allosteric modulator Ro 25-6981 (Ro), determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In the absence of Ro, the GluN2A and GluN2B amino-terminal domains (ATDs) adopt “closed” and “open” clefts, respectively. Upon binding Ro, the GluN2B ATD clamshell transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s from an open to a closed conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Consistent with a predominance of the GluN2A subunit in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel gating, the GluN2A subunit interacts more extensively with GluN1 subunits throughout the receptor, in comparison with the GluN2B subunit. Differences in the conformat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the pseudo-2-fold–related GluN1 subunits further reflect receptor asymmetry. The triheteromeric NMDAR structures provide the first view of the most common NMDA receptor assembly and show how incorporat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of two different GluN2 subunits modifies receptor symmetry and subunit interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, allowing each subunit to uniquely influence receptor structure and funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, thus increasing receptor complexity.</p>

A three-dimensional movie of structural changes in bacteriorhodopsin
<p>Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is a light-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> pump and a model membrane transport protein.

Identification of LRRC8 Heteromers as an Essential Component of the Volume-Regulated Anion Channel VRAC
<sec><title>One Swell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Channel</title><p>When mammalian cells are faced with osmotic challenges, they need to swell or shrink. The molecular characterizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the volume-regulated an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel (VRAC) remains unknown, although many candidate proteins have been proposed. <bold>Voss <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 634, published online 10 April; see the Perspective by <bold>Mindell</bold>) used a genome-wide screen to identify a group of leucine-rich repeat–containing (LRRC) proteins necessary for forming VRAC.

Unusual Roles of Secretory SNARE SYP132 in Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Traffic and Vegetative Plant Growth
<p>The plasma membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> (H<sup>+</sup>)-ATPases of plants generate steep electrochemical gradients and activate osmotic solute uptake. H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> pumping orchestrates cellular homeostasis and is a prerequisite for plastic cell expans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and plant growth. All evidence suggests that the populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma membrane reflects a balance of their roles in exocytosis, endocytosis, and recycling. Auxin governs both traffic and activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins already present at the membrane. As in other eukaryotes, in plants, SNARE-mediated membrane traffic influences the density of several proteins at the plasma membrane. Even so, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic, its relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship with SNAREs, and its regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by auxin have remained enigmatic. Here, we identify the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Qa-SNARE SYP132 (Syntaxin of Plants132) as a key factor in H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and demonstrate its associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with endocytosis. SYP132 is a low-abundant, secretory SNARE that primarily localizes to the plasma membrane. We find that <i>SYP132</i> express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is tightly regulated by auxin and that augmented SYP132 express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> reduces the amount of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma membrane. The physiological consequences of SYP132 overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> include reduced apoplast acidificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and suppressed vegetative growth. Thus, SYP132 plays unexpected and vital roles in auxin-regulated H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and associated funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s at the plasma membrane.</p>

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters
<p>Cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> (NHX-type) antiporters are important regulators of intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and are critical for cell expans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and plant stress acclimat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and pH homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth phenotypes. Exposure to sodium chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar pH and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles. These results highlight the importance of NHX-type cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the maintenance of cellular cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and in growth and development.</p>

Growth at Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> Requires Acclimation of the Respiratory Chain to Support Photosynthesis
<p>Plants will experience an elevated atmospheric concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of CO<sub>2</sub> (ECO<sub>2</sub>) in the future. Growth of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) at ECO<sub>2</sub> more than doubled the leaf protein amount of alternative oxidase (AOX), a non-energy-conserving component of mitochondrial respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. To test the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al significance of this AOX increase, wild-type tobacco was compared with AOX knockdown and overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> lines, following growth at ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or ECO<sub>2</sub>. The ECO<sub>2</sub>-grown AOX knockdowns had a reduced capacity for triose phosphate use (TPU) during photosynthesis compared with the other plant lines. This TPU limitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was associated with an increased accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of glucose-6-phosphate, sucrose, and starch in the leaves of the knockdowns. Under TPU-limiting condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, the size of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> gradient and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force across the thylakoid membrane was enhanced in the knockdowns relative to the other plant lines, suggesting a restrict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of chloroplast ATP synthase activity. This restrict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was not due to a decline in ATP synthase (AtpB) protein amount. The knockdowns also displayed a photosystem stoichiometry adjustment at ECO<sub>2</sub>, which was absent in the other plant lines. Addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al experiments showed that the way in which AOX supports photosynthesis at ECO<sub>2</sub> is distinct from its previously described role in supporting photosynthesis during water deficit. The results are discussed in terms of how AOX contributes to TPU capacity and the maintenance of chloroplast ATP synthase activity at ECO<sub>2</sub>. Overall, the evidence suggests that AOX respirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is needed to maintain both the carbon and energy balance in photosynthetic tissues during growth at ECO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

Flavodiiron-Mediated O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction Links H<sub>2</sub> Production with CO<sub>2</sub> Fixation during the Anaerobic Induction of Photosynthesis
<p>Some microalgae, such as <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, harbor a highly flexible photosynthetic apparatus capable of using different electron acceptors, including carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s, or oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), allowing survival in diverse habitats. During anaerobic induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of photosynthesis, molecular O<sub>2</sub> is produced at photosystem II, while at the photosystem I acceptor side, the reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s into hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) by the plastidial [FeFe]-hydrogenases primes CO<sub>2</sub> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Although the interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between H<sub>2</sub> product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and CO<sub>2</sub> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> has been studied extensively, their interplay with O<sub>2</sub> produced by photosynthesis has not been considered. By simultaneously measuring gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence, we identified an O<sub>2</sub> photoreduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> mechanism that funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s during anaerobic dark-to-light transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and demonstrate that flavodiiron proteins (Flvs) are the major players involved in light-dependent O<sub>2</sub> uptake. We further show that Flv-mediated O<sub>2</sub> uptake is critical for the rapid induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of CO<sub>2</sub> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> but is not involved in the creat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the micro-oxic niches proposed previously to protect the [FeFe]-hydrogenase from O<sub>2</sub>. By studying a mutant lacking both hydrogenases (HYDA1 and HYDA2) and both Flvs (FLVA and FLVB), we show that the induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of photosynthesis is strongly delayed in the absence of both sets of proteins. Based on these data, we propose that Flvs are involved in an important intracellular O<sub>2</sub> recycling process, which acts as a relay between H<sub>2</sub> product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and CO<sub>2</sub> fixat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.</p>

Flavodiiron Protein Substitutes for Cyclic Electron Flow without Competing CO<sub>2</sub> Assimilation in Rice
<p>Flavodiiron protein (FLV) mediates photoreduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O. It is conserved from cyanobacteria to gymnosperms but not in angiosperms. The introduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a moss (<i>Physcomitrella patens</i>) <i>FLV</i> (<i>PpFLV</i>) gene into Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) made photosystem I (PSI) resistant to fluctuating light. Here, we used the same strategy with three rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genotypes. PpFLV in the wild-type rice background funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ed as an efficient PSI electron sink and increased resistance to PSI photodamage under fluctuating light. The introduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of PpFLV into the <i>PGR5</i>-RNAi mutant [defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> GRADIENT REGULAT<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>5 (PGR5)-dependent cyclic electron transport around PSI, CET-PSI], the <i>crr6</i> mutant [defective in chloroplast NAD(P)H-dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH)-dependent CET-PSI], and the <i>PGR5</i>-RNAi <i>crr6</i> double mutant (double defective in CET-PSI activity) alleviated PSI photodamage under fluctuating light. Furthermore, PpFLV substituted for the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of PGR5- and NDH-dependent CET-PSI without competing for CO<sub>2</sub> assimilat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> under constant light, as there was no difference in CO<sub>2</sub> assimilat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> per Rubisco content and biomass product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was recovered to the wild-type level. Thus, the exogenous FLV system could act not only as a safety valve under fluctuating light, but also generate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> motive force for balancing the ATP/NADPH product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> ratio during steady-state photosynthesis.</p>

Environmental and Genetic Factors Regulating Localization of the Plant Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase
<p>A P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is the primary transporter that converts ATP to electrochemical energy at the plasma membrane of higher plants. Its product, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-motive force, is composed of an electrical potential and a pH gradient. Many studies have demonstrated that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-motive force not only drives the secondary transporters required for nutrient uptake, but also plays a direct role in regulating cell expans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Here, we have generated a transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plant expressing H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2) that is translat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally fused with a fluorescent protein and examined its cellular localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by live-cell microscopy. Using a 3D imaging approach with seedlings grown for various times under a variety of light intensities, we demonstrate that AHA2 localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at the plasma membrane of root cells requires light. In dim light condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, AHA2 is found in intracellular compartments, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to the plasma membrane. This localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> profile was age-dependent and specific to cell types found in the transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> zone located between the meristem and elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> zones. The accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of AHA2 in intracellular compartments is consistent with reduced H<sup>+</sup> secret<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> near the transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> zone and the suppress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of root growth. By examining AHA2 localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in a knockout mutant of a receptor protein kinase, FERONIA, we found that the intracellular accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of AHA2 in the transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> zone is dependent on a funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al FERONIA-dependent inhibitory response in root elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

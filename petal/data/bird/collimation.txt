Do varus or valgus outliers have higher forces in the medial or lateral compartments than those which are in-range after a kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of patients   with outlier varus or valgus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment in kinematically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ed   total knee arthroplasty (TKA), whether those with outlier varus   or valgus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment have higher forces in the medial or lateral   compartments of the knee than those with in-range <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment and   whether measurements of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment of the limb, knee and components   predict compartment forces.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The intra-operative forces in the medial and lateral compartments   were measured with an instrumented tibial insert in 67 patients   who underwent a kinematically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ed TKA during passive movement.   The mean of the forces at full extension, 45° and 90° of flexion   determined the force in the medial and lateral compartments. Measurements   of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment of the limb and the components included the hip-knee-ankle   (HKA) angle, proximal medial tibial angle (PMTA), and distal lateral   femoral angle (DLFA). Measurements of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment of the knee   and the components included the tibiofemoral angle (TFA), tibial   component angle (TCA) and femoral component angle (FCA). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment was   measured on post-operative, non-weight-bearing anteroposterior (AP)   scanograms and categorised as varus or valgus outlier or in-range   in relation to mechanically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ed criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The proportion of patients with outlier varus or valgus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment   was 16%/24% for the HKA angle, 55%/0% for the PMTA, 0%/57% for the   DLFA, 25%/12% for the TFA, 100%/0% for the TCA, and 0%/64% for the   FCA. In general, the forces in the medial and lateral compartments   of those with outlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment were not different from those with   in-range <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment except for the TFA, in which patients with outlier   varus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment had a mean paradoxical force which was 6 lb higher   in the lateral compartment than those with in-range <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment.

Interhospital Transfer Before Thrombectomy Is Associated With Delayed Treatment and Worse Outcome in the STRATIS Registry (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Endovascular treatment with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is beneficial for patients with acute stroke suffering a large-vessel occlusion, although treatment efficacy is highly time-dependent. We hypothesized that interhospital transfer to endovascular-capable centers would result in treatment delays and worse clinical outcomes compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>STRATIS (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke) was a prospective, multicenter, observational, single-arm study of real-world MT for acute stroke because of anterior-circulation large-vessel occlusion performed at 55 sites over 2 years, including 1000 patients with severe stroke and treated within 8 hours. Patients underwent MT with or without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and were admitted to endovascular-capable centers via either interhospital transfer or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> presentation. The primary clinical outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Score 0–2) at 90 days. We assessed (1) real-world time metrics of stroke care delivery, (2) outcome differences between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> and transfer patients undergoing MT, and (3) the potential impact of local hospital bypass.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 984 patients were analyzed. Median onset-to-revascularization time was 202.0 minutes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> versus 311.5 minutes for transfer patients (<i>P</i><0.001). Clinical outcomes were better in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> group, with 60.0% (299/498) achieving functional independence compared with 52.2% (213/408) in the transfer group (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.79; <i>P</i>=0.02). Likewise, excellent outcome (modified Rankin Score 0–1) was achieved in 47.4% (236/498) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> patients versus 38.0% (155/408) of transfer patients (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.92; <i>P</i>=0.005). Mortality did not differ between the 2 groups (15.1% for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>, 13.7% for transfer; <i>P</i>=0.55). Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator did not impact outcomes. Hypothetical bypass modeling for all transferred patients suggested that intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 12 minutes, but MT would be performed 91 minutes sooner if patients were routed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly to endovascular-capable centers. If bypass is limited to a 20-mile radius from onset, then intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 7 minutes and MT performed 94 minutes earlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this large, real-world study, interhospital transfer was associated with significant treatment delays and lower chance of good outcome. Strategies to facilitate more rapid identification of large-vessel occlusion and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> routing to endovascular-capable centers for patients with severe stroke may improve outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Vectorial representation of spatial goals in the hippocampus of bats
<p>To navigate, animals need to represent not only their own position and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ation, but also the location of their goal. Neural representations of an animal’s own position and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ation have been extensively studied. However, it is unknown how navigational goals are encoded in the brain. We recorded from hippocampal CA1 neurons of bats flying in complex trajectories toward a spatial goal. We discovered a subpopulation of neurons with angular tuning to the goal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion. Many of these neurons were tuned to an occluded goal, suggesting that goal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion representation is memory-based. We also found cells that encoded the distance to the goal, often in conjunction with goal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion. The goal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion and goal-distance signals make up a vectorial representation of spatial goals, suggesting a previously unrecognized neuronal mechanism for goal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ed navigation.</p>

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   forces during static and dynamic weight-bearing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact forces and moments were measured in nine   patients with instrumented knee implants. Medial force ratios were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend). Hip-knee-ankle angles in the frontal plane were analysed   using full-leg coronal radiographs. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The medial force ratio strongly correlated with the tibiofemoral   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment in the static condition of one-legged stance (R² = 0.88)   and dynamic single-limb loading (R² = 0.59) with varus mal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment   leading to increased medial force ratios of up to 88%. In contrast,   the correlation between leg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment and magnitude of medial compartment force   was much less pronounced. A lateral shift of force occurred during   activities with double-limb support and higher knee flexion angles. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The medial force ratio depends on both the tibiofemoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment   and the nature of the activity involved. It cannot be generalised   to a single value. Higher medial ratios during single-limb loading   are associated with varus mal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment in TKA. The current trend   towards a ‘constitutional varus’ after joint replacement, in terms   of overall tibiofemoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment, should be considered carefully   with respect to the increased medial force ratio.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:779–87.</p></sec>

The direct anterior approach in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The most effective surgical approach for total hip arthroplasty   (THA) remains controversial. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> anterior approach may be   associated with a reduced risk of dislocation, faster recovery,   reduced pain and fewer surgical complications. This systematic review   aims to evaluate the current evidence for the use of this approach   in THA.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Following the Cochrane collaboration, an extensive literature   search of PubMed, Medline, Embase and OvidSP was conducted. Randomised   controlled trials, comparative studies, and cohort studies were   included. Outcomes included the length of the incision, blood loss,   operating time, length of stay, complications, and gait analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 42 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most were of   medium to low quality. There was no difference between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>   anterior, anterolateral or posterior approaches with regards to   length of stay and gait analysis.</p><p>Papers comparing the length of the incision found similar lengths   compared with the lateral approach, and conflicting results when   comparing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> anterior and posterior approaches. </p><p>Most studies found the mean operating time to be significantly   longer when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> anterior approach was used, with a steep   learning curve reported by many.</p><p>Many authors used validated scores including the Harris hip score,   and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index.   These mean scores were better following the use of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> anterior   approach for the first six weeks post-operatively.

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals dispersion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

AGP: A Multimethods Web Server for Alignment-Free Genome Phylogeny
<p>Phylogenetic analysis based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment method meets huge challenges when dealing with whole-genome sequences, for example, recombination, shuffling, and rearrangement of sequences. Thus, various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment-free methods for phylogeny construction have been proposed. However, most of these methods have not been implemented as tools or web servers. Researchers cannot use these methods easily with their data sets. To facilitate the usage of various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment-free methods, we implemented most of the popular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment-free methods and constructed a user-friendly web server for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment-free genome phylogeny (AGP). AGP integrated the phylogenetic tree construction, visualization, and comparison functions together. Both AGP and all source code of the methods are available at <ext-link>http://www.herbbol.org:8000/agp</ext-link> (last accessed February 26, 2013). AGP will facilitate research in the field of whole-genome phylogeny and comparison.</p>

Association Between Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Blood Pressure Among Adults in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of sodium and lower levels of potassium intake are associated with higher blood pressure. However, the shape and magnitude of these associations can vary by study participant characteristics or intake assessment method. Twenty-four–hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium are unaffected by recall errors and represent all sources of intake, and were collected for the first time in a nationally representative US survey. Our objective was to assess the associations of blood pressure and hypertension with 24-hour urinary excretion of sodium and potassium among US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cross-sectional data were obtained from 766 participants age 20 to 69 years with complete blood pressure and 24-hour urine collections in the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the US noninstitutionalized population.

Fluorine-programmed nanozipping to tailored nanographenes on rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> surfaces
<p>The rational synthesis of nanographenes and carbon nanoribbons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly on nonmetallic surfaces has been an elusive goal for a long time. We report that activation of the carbon (C)–fluorine (F) bond is a reliable and versatile tool enabling intramolecular aryl-aryl coupling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly on metal oxide surfaces. A challenging multistep transformation enabled by C–F bond activation led to a dominolike coupling that yielded tailored nanographenes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly on the rutile titania surface. Because of efficient regioselective zipping, we obtained the target nanographenes from flexible precursors. Fluorine positions in the precursor structure unambiguously dictated the running of the “zipping program,” resulting in the rolling up of oligophenylene chains. The high efficiency of the hydrogen fluoride zipping makes our approach attractive for the rational synthesis of nanographenes and nanoribbons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly on insulating and semiconducting surfaces.</p>

SLAM-seq defines direct gene-regulatory functions of the BRD4-MYC axis
<p>Defining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> targets of transcription factors and regulatory pathways is key to understanding their roles in physiology and disease. We combined SLAM-seq [thiol(SH)–linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA], a method for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> quantification of newly synthesized messenger RNAs (mRNAs), with pharmacological and chemical-genetic perturbation in order to define regulatory functions of two transcriptional hubs in cancer, BRD4 and MYC, and to interrogate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> responses to BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETis). We found that BRD4 acts as general coactivator of RNA polymerase II–dependent transcription, which is broadly repressed upon high-dose BETi treatment. At doses triggering selective effects in leukemia, BETis deregulate a small set of hypersensitive targets including MYC. In contrast to BRD4, MYC primarily acts as a selective transcriptional activator controlling metabolic processes such as ribosome biogenesis and de novo purine synthesis. Our study establishes a simple and scalable strategy to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> transcriptional targets of any gene or pathway.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse polar behaviors in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional and non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional information into tropic behaviors is well understood, but it is less well understood how non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the polarity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally programmed polarity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in polarization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf polarity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>s the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and polar transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of polar auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental programming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, diffuse light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under diffuse compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level diffuse light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed diffuse light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of diffuse versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under diffuse light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute diffuse and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how diffuse light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion for future research.</p>

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> estimates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly or in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> estimate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

Moving without a purpose: an experimental study of swarm guidance in the Western honey bee, <i>Apis mellifera</i>
<p>During reproductive swarming, honey bee scouts perform two very important functions. Firstly, they find new nesting locations and return to the swarm cluster to communicate their discoveries. Secondly, once the swarm is ready to depart, informed scout bees act as guides, leading the swarm to its final destination. We have previously hypothesised that the two processes, selecting a new nest site and swarm guidance, are tightly linked in honey bees. When swarms can be <i>laissez faire</i> about where they nest, reaching <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional consensus prior to lift off seems unnecessary. If, in contrast, it is essential that the swarm reaches a precise location, either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional consensus must be near unanimous prior to swarm departure or only a select subgroup of the scouts guide the swarm. Here, we tested experimentally whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional consensus is necessary for the successful guidance of swarms of the Western honey bee <i>Apis mellifera</i> by forcing swarms into the air prior to the completion of the decision-making process. Our results show that swarms were unable to guide themselves prior to the swarm reaching the pre-flight buzzing phase of the decision-making process, even when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional consensus was high. We therefore suggest that not all scouts involved in the decision-making process attempt to guide the swarm.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> cranial bone strain and bite force in the agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i>
<p><i>In vivo</i> bone strain data are the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> evidence of deformation and strain regimes in the vertebrate cranium during feeding and can provide important insights into skull morphology. Strain data have been collected during feeding across a wide range of mammals; in contrast, <i>in vivo</i> cranial bone strain data have been collected from few sauropsid taxa. Here we present bone strain data recorded from the jugal of the herbivorous agamid lizard <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> along with simultaneously recorded bite force. Principal and shear strain magnitudes in <i>Uromastyx geyri</i> were lower than cranial bone strains recorded in <i>Alligator mississippiensis</i>, but higher than those reported from herbivorous mammals. Our results suggest that variations in principal strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ations in the facial skeleton are largely due to differences in feeding behavior and bite location, whereas food type has little impact on strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ations. Furthermore, mean principal strain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ations differ between male and female <i>Uromastyx</i> during feeding, potentially because of sexual dimorphism in skull morphology.</p>

A dynamic cell adhesion surface regulates tissue architecture in growth plate cartilage
<p>The architecture and morphogenetic properties of tissues are founded in the tissue-specific regulation of cell behaviors. In endochondral bones, the growth plate cartilage promotes bone elongation via regulated chondrocyte maturation within an ordered, three-dimensional cell array. A key event in the process that generates this cell array is the transformation of disordered resting chondrocytes into clonal columns of discoid proliferative cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ed with the primary growth vector. Previous analysis showed that column-forming chondrocytes display planar cell divisions, and the resulting daughter cells rearrange by ∼90° to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong> with the lengthening column. However, these previous studies provided limited information about the mechanisms underlying this dynamic process. Here we present new mechanistic insights generated by application of a novel time-lapse confocal microscopy method along with immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We show that, during cell division, daughter chondrocytes establish a cell-cell adhesion surface enriched in cadherins and β-catenin. Rearrangement into columns occurs concomitant with expansion of this adhesion surface in a process more similar to cell spreading than to migration. Column formation requires cell-cell adhesion, as reducing cadherin binding via chelation of extracellular calcium inhibits chondrocyte rearrangement. Importantly, physical indicators of cell polarity, such as cell body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment, are not prerequisites for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ed cell behavior. Our results support a model in which regulation of adhesive surface dynamics and cortical tension by extrinsic signaling modifies the thermodynamic landscape to promote organization of daughter cells in the context of the three-dimensional growth plate tissue.</p>

Hospital Variation in Adherence Rates to Secondary Prevention Medications and the Implications on Quality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Medication adherence is important to improve the long-term outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (MI).

Using linked Medicare Part D prescription filling data, medication adherence was defined as proportion of days covered >80% within 90 days after discharge. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compare 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events among hospitals with high, moderate, and low 90-day medication adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By 90 days after MI, overall rates of adherence to medications prescribed at discharge were 68% for β-blockers, 63% for statins, 64% for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and 72% for thienopyridines. Adherence to these medications up to 90 days varied significantly among hospitals: β-blockers (proportion of days covered >80%; 59% to 75%), statins (55% to 69%), thienopyridines (64% to 77%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (57% to 69%).

The Optimal Timing of Stage 2 Palliation for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In infants requiring 3-stage single-ventricle palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, attrition after the Norwood procedure remains significant. The effect of the timing of stage 2 palliation (S2P), a physician-modifiable factor, on long-term survival is not well understood. We hypothesized that an optimal interval between the Norwood and S2P that both minimizes pre-S2P attrition and maximizes post-S2P survival exists and is associated with individual patient characteristics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Institutes of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Pediatric Heart Network Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial public data set was used. Transplant-free survival (TFS) was modeled from (1) Norwood to S2P and (2) S2P to 3 years by using parametric hazard analysis. Factors associated with death or heart transplantation were determined for each interval. To account for staged procedures, risk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed, 3-year, post-Norwood TFS (the probability of TFS at 3 years given survival to S2P) was calculated using parametric conditional survival analysis. TFS from the Norwood to S2P was first predicted. TFS after S2P to 3 years was then predicted and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed for attrition before S2P by multiplying by the estimate of TFS to S2P. The optimal timing of S2P was determined by generating nomograms of risk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed, 3-year, post-Norwood, TFS versus the interval from the Norwood to S2P.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 547 included patients, 399 survived to S2P (73%).

The risk-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed, 3-year, TFS was 68±7%. A Norwood-S2P interval of 3 to 6 months was associated with greatest 3-year TFS overall and in patients with few risk factors. In patients with multiple risk factors, TFS was severely compromised, regardless of the timing of S2P and most severely when S2P was performed early. No difference in the optimal timing of S2P existed when stratified by shunt type.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In infants with few risk factors, progressing to S2P at 3 to 6 months after the Norwood procedure was associated with maximal TFS.

Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), open tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional open vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested vein.

Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months.

The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for open tunnel EVH, and 6% for open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes.

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statins are effective in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline expands recommended statin use, but its cost-effectiveness has not been compared with other guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the ACC/AHA guideline relative to current use, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and universal statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age over a 10-year horizon from 2016 to 2025. Sensitivity analyses varied costs, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and numbers needed to treat for 10 years per quality-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net cost savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed life-year gained of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than women. Results vary moderately with different risk thresholds for instituting statins and statin toxicity estimates but depend greatly on the disutility caused by daily medication use (pill burden).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>At a population level, the ACC/AHA guideline for expanded statin use for primary prevention is projected to treat more people, to save more lives, and to cost less compared with Adult Treatment Panel III in both men and women. Whether individuals benefit from long-term statin use for primary prevention depends more on the disutility associated with pill burden than their degree of cardiovascular risk.</p></sec>

Sex Differences in 1-Year All-Cause Rehospitalization in Patients After Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with men, women are at higher risk of rehospitalization in the first month after discharge for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, it is unknown whether this risk extends to the full year and varies by age. Explanatory factors potentially mediating the relationship between sex and rehospitalization remain unexplored and are needed to reduce readmissions. The aim of this study was to assess sex differences and factors associated with 1-year rehospitalization rates after AMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We recruited 3536 patients (33% women) ≥18 years of age hospitalized with AMI from 24 US centers into the TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients’ Health Status).

The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization) at a median follow-up of 1.9 years and analyzed on a per-lesion basis. A marginal Cox model accounted for correlated data in patients with multiple lesions, and a model to predict per-lesion outcomes was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed for confounding factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>For deferred lesions, the risk of major adverse cardiac events demonstrated a significant, inverse relationship with FFR (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.08; <i>P</i><0.001).

Perioperative Dexmedetomidine Improves Outcomes of Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Cardiac surgery is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular and other complications that translate into increased mortality and healthcare costs. This retrospective study was designed to determine whether the perioperative use of dexmedetomidine could reduce the incidence of complications and mortality after cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A total of 1134 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery and coronary artery bypass surgery plus valvular or other procedures were included. Of them, 568 received intravenous dexmedetomidine infusion and 566 did not.

The RopGEF2-ROP7/ROP2 Pathway Activated by phyB Suppresses Red Light-Induced Stomatal Opening<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Circadian rhythm of stomatal aperture is mainly regulated by light/darkness. Blue and red light induce stomatal opening through different mechanisms that are mediated by special receptors. ROP2, a member of Rho GTPase family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>), has been found to negatively regulate light-induced stomatal opening. However, the upstream guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) RopGEFs have not been revealed, and it is unclear which photoreceptor is required for the action of RopGEFs-ROPs. Here, we showed that RopGEF2 acted as a negative regulator in phytochrome B (phyB)-mediated red light-induced stomatal opening. Meanwhile, ROP7, another member of ROP family, acting redundantly with ROP2, was regulated by RopGEF2 in this process. RopGEF2 interacted with ROP7 and ROP2 and enhanced their intrinsic nucleotide exchange rates. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> interactions between phyB and RopGEF2 were detected in vitro and in plants, and phyB enhanced the GEF activity of RopGEF2 toward both ROP7 and ROP2 under light. In addition, RopGEF4 functioned redundantly with RopGEF2 in red light-induced stomatal opening by activating both ROP7 and ROP2, and <i>RopGEF2</i>/<i>RopGEF4</i> acted genetically downstream of <i>phyB</i>; however, the GEF activity of RopGEF4 was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly enhanced by phyB. These results revealed that red light-activated phyB enhances the GEF activities of RopGEF2 and RopGEF4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly or in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly, and then activate both ROP7 and ROP2 in guard cells. The negative mechanism triggered by phyB prevents the excessive stomatal opening under red light.</p>

Gametophytic Pollen Tube Guidance: Attractant Peptides, Gametic Controls, and Receptors
<p>Pollen tube guidance in flowering plants is a unique and critical process for successful sexual reproduction. The pollen tube that grows from pollen, which is the male gametophyte, precisely navigates to the embryo sac, which is the female gametophyte, within the pistil. Recent advances have clarified the molecular framework of gametophytic pollen tube guidance. Multiple species-specific attractant peptides are secreted from synergid cells, the proper development and function of which are regulated by female gametes. Multiple receptor-like kinases on the pollen tube tip are involved in sensing species-specific attractant peptides. In this Update article, recent progress in our understanding of the mechanism of gametophytic pollen tube guidance is reviewed, including attraction by synergid cells, control of pollen tube guidance by female gametes, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional growth of the pollen tube by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional cue sensing.

TCS: A New Multiple Sequence Alignment Reliability Measure to Estimate Alignment Accuracy and Improve Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction
<p>Multiple sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ment (MSA) is a key modeling procedure when analyzing biological sequences. Homology and evolutionary modeling are the most common applications of MSAs. Both are known to be sensitive to the underlying MSA accuracy. In this work, we show how this problem can be partly overcome using the transitive consistency score (TCS), an extended version of the T-Coffee scoring scheme. Using this local evaluation function, we show that one can identify the most reliable portions of an MSA, as judged from BAliBASE and PREFAB structure-based reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ments. We also show how this measure can be used to improve phylogenetic tree reconstruction using both an established simulated data set and a novel empirical yeast data set. For this purpose, we describe a novel lossless alternative to site filtering that involves overweighting the trustworthy columns. Our approach relies on the T-Coffee framework; it uses libraries of pairwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">align</span></strong>ments to evaluate any third party MSA. Pairwise projections can be produced using fast or slow methods, thus allowing a trade-off between speed and accuracy. We compared TCS with Heads-or-Tails, GUIDANCE, Gblocks, and trimAl and found it to lead to significantly better estimates of structural accuracy and more accurate phylogenetic trees. The software is available from <ext-link>www.tcoffee.org/Projects/tcs</ext-link>.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle motion, with particle motion dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle motion component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">orient</span></strong>ation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Measuring gill paracellular permeability with polyethylene glycol-4000 in freely swimming trout: proof of principle
<p>The influence of swimming activity on gill paracellular permeability has not been measured previously in fishes. We critically assessed the use of tritium-labeled polyethylene glycol ([<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000) for this purpose, a substance that is also a classic marker for extracellular fluid volume, glomerular filtration rate and drinking rate. Tests (8 h) on resting freshwater trout showed that when measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the plasma in the efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion, correction for a large excretion via glomerular filtration was essential, necessitating urinary catheterization. When measuring [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance from the water in the influx <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion, correction for a significant uptake by drinking was essential, necessitating terminal gut removal, whereas glomerular filtration losses were minimal. After correction for these alternate routes of loss and uptake, [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rates by efflux from the plasma and by influx from the water were identical, showing that gill paracellular permeability is not rectified, and can be measured in either <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ion. The influx technique with terminal gut removal was used to assess gill paracellular permeability in trout without urinary catheters freely swimming at 1.2 body lengths s<sup>−1</sup> for 8 h. Branchial [<sup>3</sup>H]PEG-4000 clearance rate (by influx from the water) increased significantly by ~80% in accord with a similar measured increase in O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate. Thus in trout, gill paracellular permeability does increase during exercise, in accord with the traditional concept of the osmorespiratory compromise.</p>

We excluded participants with known prior PAD or prevalent cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary heart disease, and congestive heart failure) and analyzed the effect of HIV status on the risk of incident PAD events after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ing for demographics, PAD risk factors, substance use, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 ribonucleic acid, and antiretroviral therapy. The primary outcome is incident peripheral artery disease events. Secondary outcomes include mortality and amputation in subjects with incident PAD events by HIV infection status, viral load, and CD4 count.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 91 953 participants, over a median follow up of 9.0 years, there were 7708 incident PAD events. Rates of incident PAD events per 1000 person-years were higher among HIV+ (11.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5–12.4) than uninfected veterans (9.9; 95% CI, 9.6–10.1). After <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ment for demographics, PAD risk factors, and other covariates, HIV+ veterans had an increased risk of incident PAD events compared with uninfected veterans (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.25). This risk was highest among those with time-updated HIV viral load >500 copies/mL (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.38–1.65) and CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.71–2.13). In contrast, HIV+ veterans with time updated CD4 cell count ≥500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> had no increased risk of PAD (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.96–1.11). Mortality rates after incident PAD events are high regardless of HIV status. HIV infection did not affect rates of amputation after incident PAD events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Infection with HIV is associated with a 19% increased risk of PAD beyond that explained by traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. However, for those with sustained CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, the risk of incident PAD events is nearly 2-fold higher whereas for those with sustained CD4 cell counts ≥500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> there is no excess risk of incident PAD events compared with uninfected people.</p></sec>

Residual Inflammatory Risk on Treatment With PCSK9 Inhibition and Statin Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The combination of statin therapy and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibition markedly lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduces cardiovascular event rates. Whether residual inflammatory risk as measured by on-treatment high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) remains an important clinical issue in such patients is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We evaluated residual inflammatory risk among 9738 patients participating in the SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2 cardiovascular outcomes trials (Studies of PCSK9 Inhibition and the Reduction in Vascular Events), who were receiving both statin therapy and bococizumab, according to on-treatment levels of hsCRP (hsCRP<sub>OT</sub>) and LDL-C<sub>OT</sub> measured 14 weeks after drug initiation. The primary end point was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina requiring urgent revascularization, or cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At 14 weeks, the mean percentage change in LDL-C among statin-treated patients who additionally received bococizumab was −60.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], −61.2 to −59.8; <i>P</i><0.001; median change, −65.4%) as compared to 6.6% (95% CI, −1.0 to 14.1; <i>P</i>=0.09; median change, 0.0%) for hsCRP. Incidence rates for future cardiovascular events for patients treated with both statin therapy and bococizumab according to hsCRP<sub>OT</sub> <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/L were 1.96, 2.50, and 3.59 events per 100 person-years, respectively, corresponding to multivariable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed hazard ratios of 1.0, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.81–1.66), and 1.62 (95% CI, 1.14–2.30) (<i>P</i>-trend=0.001) after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and LDL-C<sub>OT</sub>.

Clinical Outcomes and Cost-Effectiveness of Fractional Flow Reserve–Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies found that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not improve outcome compared with medical therapy (MT) in patients with stable coronary artery disease, but PCI was guided by angiography alone. FAME 2 trial (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) compared PCI guided by fractional flow reserve with best MT in patients with stable coronary artery disease to assess clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 888 patients with stable single-vessel or multivessel coronary artery disease with reduced fractional flow reserve were randomly assigned to PCI plus MT (n=447) or MT alone (n=441). Major adverse cardiac events included death, myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization. Costs were calculated on the basis of resource use and Medicare reimbursement rates. Changes in quality-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed life-years were assessed with utilities determined by the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions health survey at baseline and over follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Major adverse cardiac events at 3 years were significantly lower in the PCI group compared with the MT group (10.1% versus 22.0%; <i>P</i><0.001), primarily as a result of a lower rate of urgent revascularization (4.3% versus 17.2%; <i>P</i><0.001). Death and myocardial infarction were numerically lower in the PCI group (8.3% versus 10.4%; <i>P</i>=0.28). Angina was significantly less severe in the PCI group at all follow-up points to 3 years. Mean initial costs were higher in the PCI group ($9944 versus $4440; <i>P</i><0.001) but by 3 years were similar between the 2 groups ($16 792 versus $16 737; <i>P</i>=0.94).

Association Between Prompt Defibrillation and Epinephrine Treatment With Long-Term Survival After In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prior studies have reported higher in-hospital survival with prompt defibrillation and epinephrine treatment in patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). Whether this survival benefit persists after discharge is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We linked data from a national IHCA registry with Medicare files and identified 36 961 patients ≥65 years of age with an IHCA at 517 hospitals between 2000 and 2011. Patients with IHCA caused by pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were stratified by prompt (≤2 minutes) versus delayed (>2 minutes) defibrillation, whereas patients with IHCA caused by asystole or pulseless electric activity were stratified by prompt (≤5 minutes) versus delayed (>5 minutes) epinephrine treatment. The association between prompt treatment and long-term survival for each rhythm type was assessed with multivariable hierarchical modified Poisson regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 8119 patients with an IHCA caused by ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, the rate of 1-year survival was higher in those treated with prompt defibrillation than with delayed defibrillation (25.7% [1466 of 5714] versus 15.5% [373 of 2405]; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed relative risk [RR], 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32–1.69; <i>P</i><0.0001). This survival advantage persisted at 3 years (19.1% versus 11.0%; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.23–1.69; <i>P</i><0.0001) and at 5 years (14.7% versus 7.9%; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.22–1.83; <i>P</i><0.0001). Of 28 842 patients with an IHCA caused by asystole/pulseless electric activity, the rate of 1-year survival with prompt epinephrine treatment was higher than with delayed treatment (5.4% [1341 of 24 885] versus 4.3% [168 of 3957]; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02–1.41; <i>P</i>=0.02), but this survival benefit was no longer present at 3 years (3.5% versus 2.9%; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.95–1.45; <i>P</i>=0.15) and at 5 years (2.3% versus 1.9%; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.88–1.58; <i>P</i>=0.27).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Prompt defibrillation for IHCA caused by ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was associated with higher rates of long-term survival throughout 5 years of follow-up, whereas prompt epinephrine treatment for asystole/pulseless electric activity was associated with greater survival at 1 year but not at 3 or 5 years. By quantifying the greater survival associated with timely defibrillation and epinephrine administration, these findings provide important insights into the durability of survival benefits for 2 process-of-care measures in current resuscitation guidelines.</p></sec>

Surgical Enlargement of the Aortic Root Does Not Increase the Operative Risk of Aortic Valve Replacement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Surgical aortic root enlargement (ARE) during aortic valve replacement (AVR) allows for larger prosthesis implantation and may be an important adjunct to surgical AVR in the transcatheter valve-in-valve era. The incremental operative risk of adding ARE to AVR has not been established. We aimed to evaluate the early outcomes of patients undergoing AVR with or without ARE.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From January 1990 to August 2014, 7039 patients underwent AVR (AVR+ARE, n=1854; AVR, n=5185) at a single institution. Patients with aortic dissection and active endocarditis were excluded. Mean age was 65±14 years and 63% were male. Logistic regression and propensity score matching were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong> for unbalanced variables in group comparisons.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients undergoing AVR+ARE were more likely to be female (46% versus 34%, <i>P</i><0.001) and had higher rates of previous cardiac surgery (18% versus 12%, <i>P</i><0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5% versus 3%, <i>P</i>=0.004), urgent/emergent status (6% versus 4%, <i>P</i>=0.01), and worse New York Heart Association status (<i>P</i><0.001). Most patients received bioprosthetic valves (AVR+ARE: 73.4% versus AVR: 73.3%, <i>P</i>=0.98) and also underwent concomitant cardiac procedures (AVR+ARE: 68% versus AVR: 67%, <i>P</i>=0.31). Mean prosthesis size implanted was slightly smaller in patients requiring AVR+ARE versus AVR (23.4±2.1 versus 24.1±2.3, <i>P</i><0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher after AVR+ARE (4.3% versus 3.0%, <i>P</i>=0.008), although when the cohort was restricted to patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement with or without root enlargement, mortality was not statistically different (AVR+ARE: 1.7% versus AVR: 1.1%, <i>P</i>=0.29). After <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ment for baseline characteristics, AVR+ARE was not associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality when compared with AVR (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–1.41; <i>P</i>=0.85). Furthermore, AVR+ARE was not associated with an increased risk of postoperative adverse events.

Long-Term Potassium Monitoring and Dynamics in Heart Failure and Risk of Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The prognostic value of long-term potassium monitoring and dynamics in heart failure has not been characterized completely. We sought to determine the association between serum potassium values collected at follow-up with all-cause mortality in a prospective and consecutive cohort of patients discharged from a previous acute heart failure admission.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Serum potassium was measured at every physician-patient encounter, including hospital admissions and ambulatory settings. The multivariable-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed association of serum potassium with mortality was assessed by using comprehensive state-of-the-art regression methods that can accommodate time-dependent exposure modeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study sample included 2164 patients with a total of 16 116 potassium observations. Mean potassium at discharge was 4.3±0.48 mEq/L. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L), normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (>5 mEq/L) were observed at the index admission in 77 (3.6%), 1965 (90.8%), and 122 (5.6%) patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 2.8 years (range, 0.03–12.8 years), 1090 patients died (50.4%). On a continuous scale, the multivariable-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed association of potassium values and mortality revealed a nonlinear association (U-shaped) with higher risk at both ends of its distribution (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.001). Likewise, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed hazard ratios for hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, normokalemia as reference, were 2.35 (95% confidence interval, 1.40–3.93; <i>P</i>=0.001) and 1.55 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.16; <i>P</i>=0.011), respectively (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.0003).

Fibroblast-Specific Genetic Manipulation of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase In Vivo Reveals Its Central Regulatory Role in Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the heart, acute injury induces a fibrotic healing response that generates collagen-rich scarring that is at first protective but if inappropriately sustained can worsen heart disease. The fibrotic process is initiated by cytokines, neuroendocrine effectors, and mechanical strain that promote resident fibroblast differentiation into contractile and extracellular matrix–producing myofibroblasts. The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α (<i>Mapk14</i> gene) is known to influence the cardiac injury response, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> role in orchestrating programmed fibroblast differentiation and fibrosis in vivo is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A conditional <i>Mapk14</i> allele was used to delete the p38α encoding gene specifically in cardiac fibroblasts or myofibroblasts with 2 different tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase–expressing gene–targeted mouse lines. Mice were subjected to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation and monitored for survival, cardiac function, and fibrotic remodeling. Antithetically, mice with fibroblast-specific transgenic overexpression of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong> inducer of p38, were generated to investigate whether this pathway can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">direct</span></strong>ly drive myofibroblast formation and the cardiac fibrotic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In mice, loss of <i>Mapk14</i> blocked cardiac fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and ensuing fibrosis in response to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation. A similar inhibition of myofibroblast formation and healing was also observed in a dermal wounding model with deletion of <i>Mapk14</i>. Transgenic mice with fibroblast-specific activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6–p38 developed interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in the heart, lung, and kidney as a result of enhanced myofibroblast numbers. Mechanistic experiments show that p38 transduces cytokine and mechanical signals into myofibroblast differentiation through the transcription factor serum response factor and the signaling effector calcineurin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings suggest that signals from diverse modes of injury converge on p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase within the fibroblast to program the fibrotic response and myofibroblast formation in vivo, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach with p38 inhibitors for future clinical application.</p></sec>

The goal of this project was to develop a risk-standardization methodology to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong> for patient characteristics when comparing major adverse outcomes in the NCDR’s (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) IMPACT Registry (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between January 2011 and March 2014, 39 725 consecutive patients within IMPACT undergoing cardiac catheterization were identified. Given the heterogeneity of interventional procedures for congenital heart disease, new procedure-type risk categories were derived with empirical data and expert opinion, as were markers of hemodynamic vulnerability. A multivariable hierarchical logistic regression model to identify patient and procedural characteristics predictive of a major adverse event or death after cardiac catheterization was derived in 70% of the cohort and validated in the remaining 30%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rate of major adverse event or death was 7.1% and 7.2% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Six procedure-type risk categories and 6 independent indicators of hemodynamic vulnerability were identified.

Onset-to-treatment time was analyzed as a continuous, potentially nonlinear variable and as a categorical variable comparing patients treated within 60 minutes of onset with later epochs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 65 384 tissue plasminogen activator–treated patients, the median onset-to-treatment time was 141 minutes (interquartile range, 110–173) and 878 patients (1.3%) were treated within the first 60 minutes. Treatment within 60 minutes, compared with treatment within 61 to 270 minutes, was associated with increased odds of discharge to home (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.45), independent ambulation at discharge (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed odds ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.45), and freedom from disability (modified Rankin Scale 0–1) at discharge (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed odds ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.21–2.46), without increased hemorrhagic complications or in-hospital mortality.

Multimodality Strategy for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment among adults without known CVD are limited by suboptimal performance and a narrow focus on only atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). We hypothesized that a strategy combining promising biomarkers across multiple different testing modalities would improve global and atherosclerotic CVD risk assessment among individuals without known CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) (n=6621) and the Dallas Heart Study (n=2202) who were free from CVD and underwent measurement of left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Associations of test results with the global composite CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary or peripheral revascularization, incident heart failure, or atrial fibrillation) and ASCVD (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) were assessed over >10 years of follow-up. Multivariable analyses for the primary global CVD end point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed for traditional risk factors plus statin use and creatinine (base model).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each test result was independently associated with global composite CVD events in MESA after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ment for the components of the base model and the other test results (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). When the 5 tests were added to the base model, the c-statistic improved from 0.74 to 0.79 (<i>P</i>=0.001), significant integrated discrimination improvement (0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.08, <i>P</i><0.001) and category free net reclassification improvement (0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–0.56; <i>P</i>=0.003) were observed, and the model was well calibrated (χ<sup>2</sup>=12.2, <i>P</i>=0.20).

Age, sex, and body mass index-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed hazard ratios for overall VTE were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89−1.07) for hypertension, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88−1.08) for hyperlipidemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89−1.15) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08−1.32) for current smoking. After full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ment, these estimates were numerically similar. When modeled continuously, an inverse association was observed for systolic blood pressure (hazard ratio=0.79 [95% CI: 0.68−0.92] at systolic blood pressure 160 vs 110 mm Hg) but not for diastolic blood pressure or lipid measures with VTE. An important finding from VTE subtype analyses was that cigarette smoking was associated with provoked but not unprovoked VTE. Fully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adjust</span></strong>ed hazard ratios for the associations of current smoking with provoked and unprovoked VTE were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.22−1.52) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.90−1.29), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Except for the association between cigarette smoking and provoked VTE, which is potentially mediated through comorbid conditions such as cancer, the modifiable traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors are not associated with increased VTE risk. Higher systolic blood pressure showed an inverse association with VTE.</p></sec>

High-Fiber Diet and Acetate Supplementation Change the Gut Microbiota and Prevent the Development of Hypertension and Heart Failure in Hypertensive Mice
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Dietary intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with lower incidence of hypertension, but the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Here, we evaluated the effect of a high-fiber diet and supplementation with the short-chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fatty acid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate on the gut microbiota and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gut microbiome, cardiorenal structure/function, and blood pressure were examined in sham and mineralocorticoid excess–treated mice with a control diet, high-fiber diet, or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate supplementation. We also determined the renal and cardiac transcriptome of mice treated with the different diets.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that high consumption of fiber modified the gut microbiota populations and increased the abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate-producing bacteria independently of mineralocorticoid excess. Both fiber and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate decreased gut dysbiosis, measured by the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and increased the prevalence of <i>Bacteroides acidifaciens</i>. Compared with mineralocorticoid-excess mice fed a control diet, both high-fiber diet and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate supplementation significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures, cardiac fibrosis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate had similar effects and markedly reduced renal fibrosis. Transcriptome analyses showed that the protective effects of high fiber and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate were accompanied by the downregulation of cardiac and renal <i>Egr1</i>, a master cardiovascular regulator involved in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiorenal fibrosis, and inflammation. We also observed the upregulation of a network of genes involved in circadian rhythm in both tissues and downregulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A diet high in fiber led to changes in the gut microbiota that played a protective role in the development of cardiovascular disease. The favorable effects of fiber may be explained by the generation and distribution of one of the main metabolites of the gut microbiota, the short-chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fatty acid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate effected several molecular changes associated with improved cardiovascular health and function.</p></sec>

Protoplast Swelling and Hypocotyl Growth Depend on Different Auxin Signaling Pathways
<p>Members of the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX PROTEIN (TIR1/AFB) family are known auxin receptors. To analyze the possible receptor function of AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN1 (ABP1), an auxin receptor currently under debate, we performed different approaches. We performed a pharmacological approach using α-(2,4-dimethylphenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid (auxinole), α-(phenylethyl-2-oxo)-indole-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid (PEO-IAA), and 5-fluoroindole-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid (5-F-IAA) to discriminate between ABP1- and TIR1/AFB-mediated processes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We used a peptide of the carboxyl-terminal region of AtABP1 as a tool. We performed mutant analysis with the null alleles of <i>ABP1</i>, <i>abp1-c1</i> and <i>abp1-TD1</i>, and the TILLING mutant <i>abp1-5</i>. We employed Coimbra, an accession that exhibits an amino acid exchange in the auxin-binding domain of ABP1. We measured either volume changes of single hypocotyl protoplasts or hypocotyl growth, both at high temporal resolution. 5-F-IAA selectively activated the TIR1/AFB pathway but did not induce protoplast swelling; instead, it showed auxin activity in the hypocotyl growth test. In contrast, PEO-IAA induced an auxin-like swelling response but no hypocotyl growth. The carboxyl-terminal peptide of AtABP1 induced an auxin-like swelling response. In the <i>ABP1</i>-related mutants and Coimbra, no auxin-induced protoplast swelling occurred. ABP1 seems to be involved in mediating rapid auxin-induced protoplast swelling, but it is not involved in the control of rapid auxin-induced growth.</p>

Missing enzymes in the biosynthesis of the anticancer drug vinblastine in Madagascar periwinkle
<p>Vinblastine, a potent anticancer drug, is produced by <i>Catharanthus roseus</i> (Madagascar periwinkle) in small quantities, and heterologous reconstitution of vinblastine biosynthesis could provide an additional source of this drug. However, the chemistry underlying vinblastine synthesis makes identification of the biosynthetic genes challenging. Here we identify the two missing enzymes necessary for vinblastine biosynthesis in this plant: an oxidase and a reductase that isomerize stemmadenine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate into dihydroprecondylocarpine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate, which is then de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>oxylated and cyclized to either catharanthine or tabersonine via two hydrolases characterized herein. The pathways show how plants create chemical diversity and also enable development of heterologous platforms for generation of stemmadenine-derived bioactive compounds.</p>

Phospholipase Dζ Enhances Diacylglycerol Flux into Triacylglycerol<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant seeds are the primary source of triacylglycerols (TAG) for food, feed, fuel, and industrial applications. As TAG is produced from diacylglycerol (DAG), successful engineering strategies to enhance TAG levels have focused on the conversion of DAG to TAG. However, the production of TAG can be limited by flux through the enzymatic reactions that supply DAG. In this study, two <i>Arabidopsis phospholipase D</i><sub>ζ</sub> genes (<i>AtPLD<sub>ζ1</sub></i> and <i>AtPLD<sub>ζ2</sub></i>) were coexpressed in <i>Camelina sativa</i> to test whether the conversion of phosphatidylcholine to DAG impacts TAG levels in seeds. The resulting transgenic plants produced 2% to 3% more TAG as a component of total seed biomass and had increased 18:3 and 20:1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fatty acid</span></strong> levels relative to wild type. Increased DAG and decreased PC levels were examined through the kinetics of lipid assembly by [<sup>14</sup>C]<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate and [<sup>14</sup>C]glycerol incorporation into glycerolipids. [<sup>14</sup>C]<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate was rapidly incorporated into TAG in both wild-type and overexpression lines, indicating a significant flux of nascent and elongated acyl-CoAs into the <i>sn</i>-3 position of TAG. Stereochemical analysis revealed that newly synthesized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fatty acid</span></strong>s were preferentially incorporated into the <i>sn</i>-2 position of PC, but the <i>sn</i>-1 position of de novo DAG and indicated similar rates of nascent acyl groups into the Kennedy pathway and acyl editing. [<sup>14</sup>C]glycerol studies demonstrated PC-derived DAG is the major source of DAG for TAG synthesis in both tissues. The results emphasize that the interconversions of DAG and PC pools can impact oil production and composition.</p>

Reversibility of citrate synthase allows autotrophic growth of a thermophilic bacterium
<p>Biological inorganic carbon fixation proceeds through a number of fundamentally different autotrophic pathways that are defined by specific key enzymatic reactions. Detection of the enzymatic genes in (meta)genomes is widely used to estimate the contribution of individual organisms or communities to primary production. Here we show that the sulfur-reducing anaerobic deltaproteobacterium <i>Desulfurella <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ivorans</i> is capable of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate oxidation and autotrophic carbon fixation, with the tricarboxylic acid cycle operating either in the oxidative or reductive direction, respectively. Under autotrophic conditions, the enzyme citrate synthase cleaves citrate adenosine triphosphate independently into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>yl coenzyme A and oxalo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate, a reaction that has been regarded as impossible under physiological conditions. Because this overlooked, energetically efficient carbon fixation pathway lacks key enzymes, it may function unnoticed in many organisms, making bioinformatical predictions difficult, if not impossible.</p>

Lewis acid enhancement by hydrogen-bond donors for asymmetric catalysis
<p>Small-molecule dual hydrogen-bond (H-bond) donors such as ureas, thioureas, squaramides, and guanidinium ions enjoy widespread use as effective catalysts for promoting a variety of enantioselective reactions. However, these catalysts are only weakly acidic and therefore require highly reactive electrophilic substrates to be effective. We introduce here a mode of catalytic activity with chiral H-bond donors that enables enantioselective reactions of relatively unreactive electrophiles. Squaramides are shown to interact with silyl triflates by binding the triflate counterion to form a stable, yet highly Lewis acidic, complex. The silyl triflate-chiral squaramide combination promotes the generation of oxocarbenium intermediates from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>al substrates at low temperatures. Enantioselectivity in nucleophile additions to the cationic intermediates is then controlled through a network of noncovalent interactions between the squaramide catalyst and the oxocarbenium triflate.</p>

Modulation of Auxin Signaling and Development by Polyadenylation Machinery
<p>Polyadenylation influences gene expression by affecting mRNA stability, transport, and translatability. Here, we report that Cleavage stimulation Factor 77 (AtCstF77), a component of the pre-mRNA 3′-end polyadenylation machinery, affects polyadenylation site (PAS) selection in transcripts of some auxin signaling genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of <i>AtCstF77</i> reduced auxin sensitivity and decreased the expression of the auxin reporter <i>DR5</i>-<i>GFP</i>. Null mutations of <i>cstf77</i> caused severe developmental defects, but were not lethal as previously reported. <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> genetically interacted with <i>transport inhibitor response 1 auxin signaling f</i>-<i>box 2</i> auxin receptor double mutants, further supporting that polyadenylation affects auxin signaling. <i>AtCstF77</i> was ubiquitously expressed in embryos, seedlings, and adult plants. The AtCstF77 protein was localized in the nucleus, which is consistent with its function in pre-mRNA processing. We observed that PASs in transcripts from approximately 2,400 genes were shifted in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. Moreover, most of the PAS shifts were from proximal to distal sites. Auxin treatment also caused PAS shifts in transcripts from a small number of genes. Several auxin signaling or homeostasis genes had different PASs in their transcripts in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. The expression levels of <i>AUXIN RESISTANT 2</i>/<i>INDOLE</i>-<i>3</i>-<i>ACETIC ACID 7</i> were significantly increased in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant, which can partially account for the auxin resistance phenotype of this mutant. Our results demonstrate that AtCstF77 plays pleiotropic and critical roles in Arabidopsis development. Moreover, disruption of AtCstF64, another component of the polyadenylation machinery, led to developmental defects and reduced auxin response, similar to those of the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. We conclude that AtCstF77 affects auxin responses, likely by controlling PAS selection of transcripts of some auxin signaling components.</p>

Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p>Auxin controls body plan patterning in land plants and has been proposed to play a similar role in the development of brown algae (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with land plants. The mechanism of auxin action in brown algae remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model system to show that auxin plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown algae. Indole-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally develop a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meristem from the other, addition of exogenous auxins to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo developed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when variable extrinsic informational cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an inhibitor of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of transporters in land plants, affected rhizoid formation by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of auxin genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and transport genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) transporters from land plants have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>. Together with reports on auxin function in basal lineages of green algae, these results suggest that auxin function predates the divergence between the green and brown lineage and the transition toward land plants.</p>

Evidence for Exaptation of the <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i> M20D Peptidase MpILR1 into the Tracheophyte Auxin Regulatory Pathway
<p>Auxin homeostasis is tightly regulated by several mechanisms, including conjugation of the hormone to specific moieties, such as amino acids or sugar. The inactive phytohormone conjugate is stored in large pools in plants and hydrolyzed to regain full activity. Many conjugate hydrolases (M20D metallopeptidases) have been identified and characterized throughout the plant kingdom. We have traced this regulatory gene family back to liverwort (<i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>), a member of the most ancient extant land plant lineage, which emerged approximately 475 million years ago. We have isolated and characterized a single hydrolase homologue, dubbed <i>M. polymorpha</i> IAA-Leucine Resistant1 (MpILR1), from liverwort. MpILR1 can hydrolyze two auxin (indole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid [IAA]) substrates (IAA-Leucine and IPA-Alanine) at very low levels of activity, but it cannot hydrolyze the two native auxin conjugates of liverwort (IAA-Glycine and IAA-Valine). We conclude from these results that liverwort likely does not employ active auxin conjugate hydrolysis as a regulatory mechanism and that conjugate homeostasis likely takes place in liverwort by passive background degradation. Furthermore, we present evidence that MpILR1 was probably exapted by tracheophytes over evolutionary time into the auxin regulatory pathway.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

The <i>MicroRNA390</i>/<i>TRANS-ACTING SHORT INTERFERING RNA3</i> Module Mediates Lateral Root Growth under Salt Stress via the Auxin Pathway
<p>Salt-induced developmental plasticity in a plant root system strongly depends on auxin signaling. However, the molecular events underlying this process are poorly understood. <i>MicroRNA390</i> (<i>miR390</i>), <i>trans-actin small interfering RNA</i>s (<i>tasiRNA</i>s), and <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs</i> (<i>ARFs</i>) form a regulatory module involved in controlling lateral root (LR) growth. Here, we found that <i>miR390</i> expression was strongly induced by exposure to salt during LR formation in poplar (<i>Populus</i> spp.) plants. <i>miR390</i> overexpression stimulated LR development and increased salt tolerance, whereas <i>miR390</i> knockdown caused by a short tandem target mimic repressed LR growth and compromised salt resistance. <i>ARF3.1</i>, <i>ARF3.2</i>, and <i>ARF4</i> expression was inhibited significantly by the presence of salt, and transcript abundance was decreased dramatically in the <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing line but increased in the <i>miR390</i>-knockdown line. Constitutive expression of <i>ARF4m</i> harboring mutated <i>trans-acting small interfering ARF</i>-binding sites removed the salt resistance of the <i>miR390</i> overexpressors. <i>miR390</i> positively regulated auxin signaling in LRs subjected to salt, but <i>ARF4</i> inhibited auxin signaling. Salinity stabilized the poplar Aux/IAA repressor INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID17.1, and overexpression of an auxin/salt-resistant form of this repressor suppressed LR growth in <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing and <i>ARF4</i>-RNA interfering lines in the presence of salt. Thus, the <i>miR390/TAS3/ARFs</i> module is a key regulator, via modulating the auxin pathway, of LR growth in poplar subjected to salt stress.</p>

Polyamines Regulate Strawberry Fruit Ripening by Abscisic Acid, Auxin, and Ethylene<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Polyamines (PAs) participate in many plant growth and developmental processes, including fruit ripening. However, it is not clear whether PAs play a role in the ripening of strawberry (<i>Fragaria ananassa</i>), a model nonclimacteric plant. Here, we found that the content of the PA spermine (Spm) increased more sharply after the onset of fruit coloration than did that of the PAs putrescine (Put) or spermidine (Spd). Spm dominance in ripe fruit resulted from abundant transcripts of a strawberry <i>S</i>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-Met decarboxylase gene (<i>FaSAMDC</i>), which encodes an enzyme that generates a residue needed for PA biosynthesis. Exogenous Spm and Spd promoted fruit coloration, while exogenous Put and a SAMDC inhibitor inhibited coloration. Based on transcriptome data, up- and down-regulation of <i>FaSAMDC</i> expression promoted and inhibited ripening, respectively, which coincided with changes in several physiological parameters and their corresponding gene transcripts, including firmness, anthocyanin content, sugar content, polyamine content, auxin (indole-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid [IAA]) content, abscisic acid (ABA) content, and ethylene emission. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we found that FaSAMDC also had a high enzymatic activity with a <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 1.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup> <sc>m</sc>. In conclusion, PAs, especially Spm, regulate strawberry fruit ripening in an ABA-dominated, IAA-participating, and ethylene-coordinated manner, and FaSAMDC plays an important role in ripening.</p>

The sHSP22 Heat Shock Protein Requires the ABI1 Protein Phosphatase to Modulate Polar Auxin Transport and Downstream Responses
<p>The phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and indole-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid (IAA) response pathways interact synergistically or antagonistically to regulate plant development and environmental adaptation. Here, we show that <i>ABI1</i>, a key negative regulator of ABA signaling, is essential for auxin-modulated root development. We performed a microarray analysis using the loss-of-function mutant <i>abi1-3</i> and Col-0 seedlings treated with IAA. For <i>sHSP22</i>, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) small heat shock protein-encoding gene, the induction by IAA was dependent on <i>ABI1</i>. <i>shsp22</i> displayed enhanced sensitivity to ABA in primary root growth. In contrast, overexpression of full-length, but not truncated sHSP22 lacking signal peptide and ER-retention sequences, resulted in decreased ABA sensitivity. Overexpressed (OX) <i>sHSP22</i> partially rescued the ABA hypersensitivity of <i>abi1-3</i>. In addition, <i>sHSP22</i> is involved in auxin-regulated hypocotyl elongation at high temperature treatment. <i>sHSP22</i> also affected accumulation of auxin efflux carrier PIN proteins due to potentiated intracellular trafficking. And <i>sHSP22 OX</i> lines initiated more lateral roots after auxin application. Our results suggest that sHSP22 regulates auxin response through modulating auxin polar transport, and ABI1-sHSP22 provides a novel module orchestrating ABA and auxin signaling crosstalk in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Regulation of Hormonal Control, Cell Reprogramming, and Patterning during De Novo Root Organogenesis
<p>Body regeneration through formation of new organs is a major question in developmental biology. We investigated de novo root formation using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our results show that local cytokinin biosynthesis and auxin biosynthesis in the leaf blade followed by auxin long-distance transport to the petiole leads to proliferation of J0121-marked xylem-associated tissues and others through signaling of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE28 (IAA28), CRANE (IAA18), WOODEN LEG, and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS1 (ARR1), ARR10, and ARR12. Vasculature proliferation also involves the cell cycle regulator KIP-RELATED PROTEIN2 and ABERRANT LATERAL ROOT FORMATION4, resulting in a mass of cells with rooting competence that resembles callus formation. Endogenous callus formation precedes specification of postembryonic root founder cells, from which roots are initiated through the activity of SHORT-ROOT, PLETHORA1 (PLT1), and PLT2. Primordia initiation is blocked in <i>shr plt1 plt2</i> mutant. Stem cell regulators SCHIZORIZA, JACKDAW, BLUEJAY, and SCARECROW also participate in root initiation and are required to pattern the new organ, as mutants show disorganized and reduced number of layers and tissue initials resulting in reduced rooting. Our work provides an organ regeneration model through de novo root formation, stating key stages and the primary pathways involved.</p>

Auxin and ROP GTPase Signaling of Polar Nuclear Migration in Root Epidermal Hair Cells
<p>Polar nuclear migration is crucial during the development of diverse eukaryotes. In plants, root hair growth requires polar nuclear migration into the outgrowing hair. However, knowledge about the dynamics and the regulatory mechanisms underlying nuclear movements in root epidermal cells remains limited. Here, we show that both auxin and Rho-of-Plant (ROP) signaling modulate polar nuclear position at the inner epidermal plasma membrane domain oriented to the cortical cells during cell elongation as well as subsequent polar nuclear movement to the outer domain into the emerging hair bulge in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Auxin signaling via the nuclear AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE ACETIC ACID7 pathway ensures correct nuclear placement toward the inner membrane domain. Moreover, precise inner nuclear placement relies on SPIKE1 Rho-GEF, SUPERCENTIPEDE1 Rho-GDI, and ACTIN7 (ACT7) function and to a lesser extent on VTI11 vacuolar SNARE activity. Strikingly, the directionality and/or velocity of outer polar nuclear migration into the hair outgrowth along actin strands also are ACT7 dependent, auxin sensitive, and regulated by ROP signaling. Thus, our findings provide a founding framework revealing auxin and ROP signaling of inner polar nuclear position with some contribution by vacuolar morphology and of actin-dependent outer polar nuclear migration in root epidermal hair cells.</p>

Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i>
<p>The phytohormone auxin regulates many aspects of growth and development in land plants, but the origin and evolution of auxin signaling and response mechanisms remain largely unknown. Indeed, it remains to be investigated whether auxin-related pathways diverged before the emergence of land plants. To address this knowledge deficit, we analyzed auxin responses in the charophyte alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i> NIES-2285, whose ancestor diverged from a green algal ancestor during the evolution of land plants. This strain is the same as <i>Klebsormidium flaccidum</i> NIES-2285, for which the draft genome was sequenced in 2014, and was taxonomically reclassified as <i>K. nitens</i>. This genome sequence revealed genes involved in auxin responses. Furthermore, the auxin indole-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid (IAA) was detected in cultures of <i>K. nitens</i>, but <i>K. nitens</i> lacks the central regulators of the canonical auxin-signaling pathway found in land plants. Exogenous IAA inhibited cell division and cell elongation in <i>K. nitens</i>. Inhibitors of auxin biosynthesis and of polar auxin transport also inhibited cell division and elongation. Moreover, exogenous IAA rapidly induced expression of a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN transcription factor. These results suggest that <i>K. nitens</i> has acquired the part of the auxin system that regulates transcription and cell growth without the requirement for the central players that govern auxin signaling in land plants.</p>

MtLAX2, a Functional Homologue of the Arabidopsis Auxin Influx Transporter AUX1, Is Required for Nodule Organogenesis
<p>Most legume plants can form nodules, specialized lateral organs that form on roots, and house nitrogen-fixing bacteria collectively called rhizobia. The uptake of the phytohormone auxin into cells is known to be crucial for development of lateral roots. To test the role of auxin influx in nodulation we used the auxin influx inhibitors 1-naphthoxy<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid (1-NOA) and 2-NOA, which we found reduced nodulation of <i>Medicago truncatula.</i> This suggested the possible involvement of the AUX/LAX family of auxin influx transporters in nodulation. Gene expression studies identified <i>MtLAX2</i>, a paralogue of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>AUX1</i>, as being induced at early stages of nodule development. <i>MtLAX2</i> is expressed in nodule primordia, the vasculature of developing nodules, and at the apex of mature nodules. The <i>MtLAX2</i> promoter contains several auxin response elements, and treatment with indole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid strongly induces <i>MtLAX2</i> expression in roots. <i>mtlax2</i> mutants displayed root phenotypes similar to Arabidopsis <i>aux1</i> mutants, including altered root gravitropism, fewer lateral roots, shorter root hairs, and auxin resistance. In addition, the activity of the synthetic DR5-GUS auxin reporter was strongly reduced in <i>mtlax2</i> roots. Following inoculation with rhizobia, <i>mtlax2</i> roots developed fewer nodules, had decreased DR5-GUS activity associated with infection sites, and had decreased expression of the early auxin responsive gene <i>ARF16a</i>. Our data indicate that MtLAX2 is a functional analog of Arabidopsis AUX1 and is required for the accumulation of auxin during nodule formation in tissues underlying sites of rhizobial infection.</p>

Constitutive Expression of Arabidopsis <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA19</i> (<i>SAUR19</i>) in Tomato Confers Auxin-Independent Hypocotyl Elongation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The plant hormone indole-3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ic acid (IAA or auxin) mediates the elongation growth of shoot tissues by promoting cell expansion. According to the acid growth theory proposed in the 1970s, auxin activates plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases) to facilitate cell expansion by both loosening the cell wall through acidification and promoting solute uptake. Mechanistically, however, this process is poorly understood. Recent findings in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have demonstrated that auxin-induced <i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i> (<i>SAUR</i>) genes promote elongation growth and play a key role in PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activation by inhibiting PP2C.D family protein phosphatases. Here, we extend these findings by demonstrating that SAUR proteins also inhibit tomato PP2C.D family phosphatases and that AtSAUR19 overexpression in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) confers the same suite of phenotypes as previously reported for Arabidopsis. Furthermore, we employ a custom image-based method for measuring hypocotyl segment elongation with high resolution and a method for measuring cell wall mechanical properties, to add mechanistic details to the emerging description of auxin-mediated cell expansion. We find that constitutive expression of GFP-AtSAUR19 bypasses the normal requirement of auxin for elongation growth by increasing the mechanical extensibility of excised hypocotyl segments. In contrast, hypocotyl segments overexpressing a PP2C.D phosphatase are specifically impaired in auxin-mediated elongation. The time courses of auxin-induced <i>SAUR</i> expression and auxin-dependent elongation growth were closely correlated. These findings indicate that induction of <i>SAUR</i> expression is sufficient to elicit auxin-mediated expansion growth by activating PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases to facilitate apoplast acidification and mechanical wall loosening.</p>

Two Trichome Birefringence-Like Proteins Mediate Xylan Acetylation, Which Is Essential for Leaf Blight Resistance in Rice
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ylation is a ubiquitous modification on cell wall polymers, which play a structural role in plant growth and stress defenses. However, the mechanisms for how crop plants accomplish cell wall polymer <i>O</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ylation are largely unknown. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of two <i>trichome birefringence-like</i> (<i>tbl</i>) mutants in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), which are affected in xylan <i>O</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ylation. <i>ostbl1</i> and <i>ostbl2</i> single mutant and the <i>tbl1 tbl2</i> double mutant displayed a stunted growth phenotype with varied degree of dwarfism. As shown by chemical assays, the wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ylation level is affected in the mutants and the knock-down and overexpression transgenic plants. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopy analyses showed that all those mutants have varied decreases in xylan mono<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ylation. The divergent expression levels of <i>OsTBL1</i> and <i>OsTBL2</i> explained the chemotype difference and indicated that <i>OsTBL1</i> is a functionally dominant gene. OsTBL1 was found to be Golgi-localized. The recombinant OsTBL1 protein incorporates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>yl groups onto xylan. By using xylopentaose, a preferred acceptor substrate, OsTBL1 can transfer up to four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>yl residues onto xylopentaose, and this activity showed saturable kinetics. 2D-NMR spectroscopy showed that OsTBL1 transfers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate to both 2-<i>O</i> and 3-<i>O</i> sites of xylosyl residues. In addition, <i>ostbl1</i> and <i>tbl1 tbl2</i> displayed susceptibility to rice blight disease, indicating that this xylan modification is required for pathogen resistance. This study identifies the major genes responsible for xylan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ylation in rice plants.</p>

A DII Domain-Based Auxin Reporter Uncovers Low Auxin Signaling during Telophase and Early G1
<p>A sensitive and dynamically responsive auxin signaling reporter based on the DII domain of the INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID28 (IAA28, DII) protein from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was modified for use in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The DII domain was fused to a yellow fluorescent protein and a nuclear localization sequence to simplify quantitative nuclear fluorescence signal. DII degradation dynamics provide an estimate of input signal into the auxin signaling pathway that is influenced by both auxin accumulation and F-box coreceptor concentration. In maize, the DII-based marker responded rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner to exogenous auxin via proteasome-mediated degradation. Low levels of DII-specific fluorescence corresponding to high endogenous auxin signaling occurred near vasculature tissue and the outer layer and glume primordia of spikelet pair meristems and floral meristems, respectively. In addition, high DII levels were observed in cells during telophase and early G1, suggesting that low auxin signaling at these stages may be important for cell cycle progression.</p>

Olfactory memories are intensity specific in larval <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Learning can rely on stimulus quality, stimulus intensity, or a combination of these. Regarding olfaction, the coding of odour quality is often proposed to be combinatorial along the olfactory pathway, and working hypotheses are available concerning short-term associative memory trace formation of odour quality. However, it is less clear how odour intensity is coded, and whether olfactory memory traces include information about the intensity of the learnt odour. Using odour–sugar associative conditioning in larval <i>Drosophila</i>, we first describe the dose–effect curves of learnability across odour intensities for four different odours (<i>n</i>-amyl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate, 3-octanol, 1-octen-3-ol and benzaldehyde). We then chose odour intensities such that larvae were trained at an intermediate odour intensity, but were tested for retention with either that trained intermediate odour intensity, or with respectively higher or lower intensities. We observed a specificity of retention for the trained intensity for all four odours used. This adds to the appreciation of the richness in ‘content’ of olfactory short-term memory traces, even in a system as simple as larval <i>Drosophila</i>, and to define the demands on computational models of associative olfactory memory trace formation. We suggest two kinds of circuit architecture that have the potential to accommodate intensity learning, and discuss how they may be implemented in the insect brain.</p>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision   arthroplasty surgery. Proprietary cement preparations containing   vancomycin are available, but are significantly more expensive.   We investigated whether the elution of antibiotic from ‘home-made’   cement containing vancomycin was comparable with more expensive   commercially available vancomycin impregnated cement.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 18 cement discs containing either proprietary CopalG+V;   or ‘home-made’ CopalR+G with vancomycin added by hand, were made.   Each disc contained the same amount of antibiotic (0.5 g gentamycin,   2 g vancomycin) and was immersed in ammonium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate buffer in a   sealed container. Fluid from each container was sampled at eight   time points over a two-week period. The concentrations of gentamicin   and vancomycin in the fluid were analysed using high performance   liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The highest peak concentrations of antibiotic were observed from   the ‘home-made’ cements containing vancomycin, added as in the operating   theatre. The overall elution of antibiotic was, fivefold (vancomycin)   and twofold (gentamicin) greater from the ‘home-made’ mix compared   with the commercially mixed cement. The use of a vacuum during mixing   had no significant effect on antibiotic elution in any of the samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that the addition of 2 g vancomycin powder   to gentamicin-impregnated bone cement by hand significantly increases   the elution of both antibiotics compared with commercially prepared   cements containing vancomycin. We found no significant advantages   of using expensive commercially produced vancomycin-impregnated cement   and recommend the addition of vancomycin powder by hand in the operating theatre.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:73–7.</p></sec>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A new mouse model of Canavan leukodystrophy displays hearing impairment due to central nervous system dysmyelination
<p>Canavan disease is a leukodystrophy caused by mutations in the <i>ASPA</i> gene. This gene encodes the enzyme that converts N-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ylaspartate into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">acet</span></strong>ate and aspartic acid. In Canavan disease, spongiform encephalopathy of the brain causes progressive mental retardation, motor deficit and death. We have isolated a mouse with a novel ethylnitrosourea-induced mutation in <i>Aspa</i>. This mutant, named <i>deaf14</i>, carries a c.516T>A mutation that is predicted to cause a p.Y172X protein truncation. No full-length ASPA protein is produced in <i>deaf14</i> brain and there is extensive spongy degeneration. Interestingly, we found that <i>deaf14</i> mice have an attenuated startle in response to loud noise. The first auditory brainstem response peak has normal latency and amplitude but peaks II, III, IV and V have increased latency and decreased amplitude in <i>deaf14</i> mice. Our work reveals a hitherto unappreciated pathology in a mouse model of Canavan disease, implying that auditory brainstem response testing could be used in diagnosis and to monitor the progression of this disease.</p>

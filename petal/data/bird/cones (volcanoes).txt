Earth and Moon impact flux increased at the end of the Paleozoic
<p>The terrestrial impact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong> record is commonly assumed to be biased, with erosion thought to eliminate older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong>s, even on stable terrains. Given that the same projectile population strikes Earth and the Moon, terrestrial selection effects can be quantified by using a method to date lunar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong>s with diameters greater than 10 kilometers and younger than 1 billion years. We found that the impact rate increased by a factor of 2.6 about 290 million years ago. The terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong> record shows similar results, suggesting that the deficit of large terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong>s between 300 million and 650 million years ago relative to more recent times stems from a lower impact flux, not preservation bias. The almost complete absence of terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong>s older than 650 million years may indicate a massive global-scale erosion event near that time.</p>

Seismic constraints on caldera dynamics from the 2015 Axial Seamount eruption
<p>Seismic observations in volcanically active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong>s are challenging. A new cabled observatory atop Axial Seamount on the Juan de Fuca ridge allows unprecedented real-time monitoring of a submarine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong>. Beginning on 24 April 2015, the seismic network captured an eruption that culminated in explosive acoustic signals where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lava</span></strong> erupted on the seafloor. Extensive seismic activity preceding the eruption shows that inflation is accommodated by the reactivation of an outward-dipping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong> ring fault, with strong tidal triggering indicating a critically stressed system. The ring fault accommodated deflation during the eruption and provided a pathway for a dike that propagated south and north beneath the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong>’s east wall. Once north of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong>, the eruption stepped westward, and a dike propagated along the extensional north rift.</p>

Impact craters on Pluto and Charon indicate a deficit of small Kuiper belt objects
<p>The flyby of Pluto and Charon by the New Horizons spacecraft provided high-resolution images of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong>ed surfaces embedded in the Kuiper belt, an extensive region of bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. Impact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong>s on Pluto and Charon were formed by collisions with other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) with diameters from ~40 kilometers to ~300 meters, smaller than most KBOs observed directly by telescopes. We find a relative paucity of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong>s ≲13 kilometers in diameter, which cannot be explained solely by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical resurfacing. This implies a deficit of small KBOs (≲1 to 2 kilometers in diameter). Some surfaces on Pluto and Charon are likely ≳4 billion years old, thus their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong> records provide information on the size-frequency distribution of KBOs in the early Solar System.</p>

Ecophysiological responses of <i>Betula pendula</i>, <i>Pinus uncinata</i> and <i>Rhododendron ferrugineum</i> in the Catalan Pyrenees to low summer rainfall
<p>Climate change is producing modifications in the intensity and frequency of rainfall in some regions of the planet. According to predictions, annual rainfall distribution in Western Europe will result in an increase in episodes of drought, thereby negatively affecting nutrient availability. Since high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> systems will be particularly vulnerable, the physiological and nutritional responses to changes in summer rainfall were monitored over the course of two consecutive summers on three species, which are representative of subalpine forests: birch (<i>Betula pendula</i> Roth.), rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron ferrugineum</i> L.) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> pine (<i>Pinus uncinata</i> Mill.). Birch was especially susceptible to scarce precipitation showing alterations in leaf morphology and a decline in net photosynthesis (<i>A</i>) due to stomatal closure, which led to photoinhibition and to early leaf senescence as shown by the photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE), carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio, foliar N and <sup>13</sup>C isotope discrimination (Δ<sup>13</sup>C) results. The Δ<sup>13</sup>C of the soluble fraction is a good estimator of intrinsic water-use efficiency in this species. Rhododendron and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> pine had sclerophyllous leaves, as indicated by leaf mass per area, Δ<sup>13</sup>C, PNUE and C/N results. Rhododendron was particularly affected by short periods of scarce rainfall, which negatively affected gas exchange and photochemistry, and reduced the remobilization of leaf N and P. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> pine was the most tolerant species since alterations of gas exchange, photochemistry and Δ<sup>13</sup>C were not observed. Its highest investment of N in RuBisCo and highest potassium, iron and magnesium leaf concentration contributed to the highest <i>A</i> rates observed.</p>

The 2018 rift eruption and summit collapse of Kīlauea Volcano
<p>In 2018, Kīlauea Volcano experienced its largest lower East Rift Zone (LERZ) eruption and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong> collapse in at least 200 years. After collapse of the Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō vent on 30 April, magma propagated downrift. Eruptive fissures opened in the LERZ on 3 May, eventually extending ~6.8 kilometers. A 4 May earthquake [moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 6.9] produced ~5 meters of fault slip. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lava</span></strong> erupted at rates exceeding 100 cubic meters per second, eventually covering 35.5 square kilometers. The summit magma system partially drained, producing minor explosions and near-daily collapses releasing energy equivalent to <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 4.7 to 5.4 earthquakes. Activity declined rapidly on 4 August. Summit collapse and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lava</span></strong> flow volume estimates are roughly equivalent—about 0.8 cubic kilometers. Careful historical observation and monitoring of Kīlauea enabled successful forecasting of hazardous events.</p>

Microbial oxidation of lithospheric organic carbon in rapidly eroding tropical mountain soils
<p>Lithospheric organic carbon (“petrogenic”; OC<sub>petro</sub>) is oxidized during exhumation and subsequent erosion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> ranges. This process is a considerable source of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to the atmosphere over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ic time scales, but the mechanisms that govern oxidation rates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> landscapes are poorly constrained. We demonstrate that, on average, 67 ± 11% of the OC<sub>petro</sub> initially present in bedrock exhumed from the tropical, rapidly eroding Central Range of Taiwan is oxidized in soils, leading to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 6.1 to 18.6 metric tons of carbon per square kilometer per year. The molecular and isotopic evolution of bulk OC and lipid biomarkers during soil formation reveals that OC<sub>petro</sub> remineralization is microbially mediated. Rapid oxidation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> soils drives CO<sub>2</sub> emission fluxes that increase with erosion rate, thereby counteracting CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown by silicate weathering and biospheric OC burial.</p>

Coseismic rupturing stopped by Aso volcano during the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.1 Kumamoto earthquake, Japan
<p>Field investigations and seismic data show that the 16 April 2016 moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 7.1 Kumamoto earthquake produced a ~40-kilometer-long surface rupture zone along the northeast-southwest–striking Hinagu-Futagawa strike-slip fault zone and newly identified faults on the western side of Aso <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong>, Kyushu Island, Japan. The coseismic surface ruptures cut Aso <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong>, including two volcanic cones inside it, but terminate therein. The data show that northeastward propagation of coseismic rupturing terminated in Aso <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong> because of the presence of magma beneath the Aso volcanic cluster. The seismogenic faults of the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake may require reassessment of the volcanic hazard in the vicinity of Aso <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>.</p>

Paleo-Drainage Basin Connectivity Predicts Evolutionary Relationships across Three Southeast Asian Biodiversity Hotspots
<p>Understanding factors driving diversity across biodiversity hotspots is critical for formulating conservation priorities in the face of ongoing and escalating environmental deterioration. While biodiversity hotspots encompass a small fraction of Earth's land surface, more than half the world's plants and two-thirds of terrestrial vertebrate species are endemic to these hotspots. Tropical Southeast (SE) Asia displays extraordinary species richness, encompassing four biodiversity hotspots, though disentangling multiple potential drivers of species richness is confounded by the region's dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical and climatic history. Here, we use multilocus molecular genetic data from dense multispecies sampling of freshwater fishes across three biodiversity hotspots, to test the effect of Quaternary climate change and resulting drainage rearrangements on aquatic faunal diversification. While Cenozoic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical processes have clearly shaped evolutionary history in SE Asian halfbeak fishes, we show that paleo-drainage re-arrangements resulting from Quaternary climate change played a significant role in the spatiotemporal evolution of lowland aquatic taxa, and provide priorities for conservation efforts.

Redox stratification of an ancient lake in Gale crater, Mars

Geological reconstructions from Curiosity rover data have revealed an ancient, habitable lake environment fed by rivers draining into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong>. We synthesize geochemical and mineralogical data from lake-bed mudstones collected during the first 1300 martian solar days of rover operations in Gale. We present evidence for lake redox stratification, established by depth-dependent variations in atmospheric oxidant and dissolved-solute concentrations. Paleoclimate proxy data indicate that a transition from colder to warmer climate conditions is preserved in the stratigraphy. Finally, a late phase of geochemical modification by saline fluids is recognized.</p>

U-Pb constraints on pulsed eruption of the Deccan Traps across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction
<p>Temporal correlation between some continental flood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">basalt</span></strong> eruptions and mass extinctions has been proposed to indicate causality, with eruptive volatile release driving environmental degradation and extinction. We tested this model for the Deccan Traps flood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">basalt</span></strong> province, which, along with the Chicxulub bolide impact, is implicated in the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction approximately 66 million years ago. We estimated Deccan eruption rates with uranium-lead (U-Pb) zircon geochronology and resolved four high-volume eruptive periods. According to this model, maximum eruption rates occurred before and after the K-Pg extinction, with one such pulse initiating tens of thousands of years prior to both the bolide impact and extinction. These findings support extinction models that incorporate both catastrophic events as drivers of environmental deterioration associated with the K-Pg extinction and its aftermath.</p>

A surface gravity traverse on Mars indicates low bedrock density at Gale crater
<p>Gravimetry, the precise measurement of gravitational fields, can be used to probe the internal structure of Earth and other planets. The Curiosity rover on Mars carries accelerometers normally used for navigation and attitude determination. We have recalibrated them to isolate the signature of the changing gravitational acceleration as the rover climbs through Gale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong>. The subsurface rock density is inferred from the measured decrease in gravitational field strength with elevation. The density of the sedimentary rocks in Gale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong> is 1680 ± 180 kilograms per cubic meter. This value is lower than expected, indicating a high porosity and constraining maximum burial depths of the rocks over their history.</p>

Dunes on Pluto
<p>The surface of Pluto is more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ically diverse and dynamic than had been expected, but the role of its tenuous atmosphere in shaping the landscape remains unclear. We describe observations from the New Horizons spacecraft of regularly spaced, linear ridges whose morphology, distribution, and orientation are consistent with being transverse dunes. These are located close to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong>ous regions and are orthogonal to nearby wind streaks. We demonstrate that the wavelength of the dunes (~0.4 to 1 kilometer) is best explained by the deposition of sand-sized (~200 to ~300 micrometer) particles of methane ice in moderate winds (<10 meters per second). The undisturbed morphology of the dunes, and relationships with the underlying convective glacial ice, imply that the dunes have formed in the very recent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical past.</p>

Hydraulic fracturing volume is associated with induced earthquake productivity in the Duvernay play
<p>A sharp increase in the frequency of earthquakes near Fox Creek, Alberta, began in December 2013 in response to hydraulic fracturing. Using a hydraulic fracturing database, we explore relationships between injection parameters and seismicity response. We show that induced earthquakes are associated with completions that used larger injection volumes (10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> cubic meters) and that seismic productivity scales linearly with injection volume. Injection pressure and rate have an insignificant association with seismic response. Further findings suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical factors play a prominent role in seismic productivity, as evidenced by spatial correlations. Together, volume and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical factors account for ~96% of the variability in the induced earthquake rate near Fox Creek. This result is quantified by a seismogenic index–modified frequency-magnitude distribution, providing a framework to forecast induced seismicity.</p>

Remobilization of crustal carbon may dominate volcanic arc emissions
<p>The flux of carbon into and out of Earth’s surface environment has implications for Earth’s climate and habitability. We compiled a global data set for carbon and helium isotopes from volcanic arcs and demonstrated that the carbon isotope composition of mean global volcanic gas is considerably heavier, at –3.8 to –4.6 per mil (‰), than the canonical mid-ocean ridge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">basalt</span></strong> value of –6.0‰. The largest volcanic emitters outgas carbon with higher δ<sup>13</sup>C and are located in mature continental arcs that have accreted carbonate platforms, indicating that reworking of crustal limestone is an important source of volcanic carbon. The fractional burial of organic carbon is lower than traditionally determined from a global carbon isotope mass balance and may have varied over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical time, modulated by supercontinent formation and breakup.</p>

Massive blow-out craters formed by hydrate-controlled methane expulsion from the Arctic seafloor
<p>Widespread methane release from thawing Arctic gas hydrates is a major concern, yet the processes, sources, and fluxes involved remain unconstrained. We present geophysical data documenting a cluster of kilometer-wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong>s and mounds from the Barents Sea floor associated with large-scale methane expulsion. Combined with ice sheet/gas hydrate modeling, our results indicate that during glaciation, natural gas migrated from underlying hydrocarbon reservoirs and was sequestered extensively as subglacial gas hydrates. Upon ice sheet retreat, methane from this hydrate reservoir concentrated in massive mounds before being abruptly released to form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong>s. We propose that these processes were likely widespread across past glaciated petroleum provinces and that they also provide an analog for the potential future destabilization of subglacial gas hydrate reservoirs beneath contemporary ice sheets.</p>

Volcanic tremor and plume height hysteresis from Pavlof Volcano, Alaska
<p>The March 2016 eruption of Pavlof <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>, Alaska, produced an ash plume that caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights in North America. The eruption generated strong tremor that was recorded by seismic and remote low-frequency acoustic (infrasound) stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array. The relationship between the tremor amplitudes and plume height changes considerably between the waxing and waning portions of the eruption. Similar hysteresis has been observed between seismic river noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and erosional processes in both rivers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>es can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in geophysical data. We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the tremor source related to volcanic vent erosion. This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity.</p>

Inflation-predictable behavior and co-eruption deformation at Axial Seamount
<p>Deformation of the ground surface at active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>es provides information about magma movements at depth. Improved seafloor deformation measurements between 2011 and 2015 documented a fourfold increase in magma supply and confirmed that Axial Seamount’s eruptive behavior is inflation-predictable, probably triggered by a critical level of magmatic pressure. A 2015 eruption was successfully forecast on the basis of this deformation pattern and marked the first time that deflation and tilt were captured in real time by a new seafloor cabled observatory, revealing the timing, location, and volume of eruption-related magma movements. Improved modeling of the deformation suggests a steeply dipping prolate-spheroid pressure source beneath the eastern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong> that is consistent with the location of the zone of highest melt within the sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">caldera</span></strong> magma reservoir determined from multichannel seismic results.</p>

The formation of peak rings in large impact craters
<p>Large impacts provide a mechanism for resurfacing planets through mixing near-surface rocks with deeper material. Central peaks are formed from the dynamic uplift of rocks during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong> formation. As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong> size increases, central peaks transition to peak rings. Without samples, debate surrounds the mechanics of peak-ring formation and their depth of origin. Chicxulub is the only known impact structure on Earth with an unequivocal peak ring, but it is buried and only accessible through drilling. Expedition 364 sampled the Chicxulub peak ring, which we found was formed from uplifted, fractured, shocked, felsic basement rocks. The peak-ring rocks are cross-cut by dikes and shear zones and have an unusually low density and seismic velocity. Large impacts therefore generate vertical fluxes and increase porosity in planetary crust.</p>

The simulated impact produced a transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong>, ~390 kilometers in diameter, that was not maintained because of subsequent gravitational collapse. Our simulations indicate that the flow of warm weak material at depth was crucial to the formation of the basin’s outer rings, which are large normal faults that formed at different times during the collapse stage. The key parameters controlling ring location and spacing are impactor diameter and lunar thermal gradients.</p>

Melting of subducted basalt at the core-mantle boundary
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical materials in Earth's lowermost mantle control the characteristics and interpretation of seismic ultra–low velocity zones at the base of the core-mantle boundary.

We explored the melting properties of mid-oceanic ridge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">basalt</span></strong> (MORB), which can reach the lowermost mantle after subduction of oceanic crust. At a pressure representative of the core-mantle boundary (135 gigapascals), the onset of melting occurs at ~3800 kelvin, which is ~350 kelvin below the mantle solidus. The SiO<sub>2</sub>-rich liquid generated either remains trapped in the MORB material or solidifies after reacting with the surrounding MgO-rich mantle, remixing subducted MORB with the lowermost mantle.</p>

A 90,000-year record of Afromontane forest responses to climate change

Lake Bambili (Cameroon) provides a record of vegetation changes in the tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong>s of Africa over the past 90,000 years, with high temporal resolution. Pollen data and biome reconstructions show a diverging response of forests to climate changes; the upper tree line was extremely unstable, shifting substantially in response to glacial-interglacial climate alternation, whereas the transition between the montane and lowland forests remained remarkably stable. Such ecological instability may have had a critical influence on species richness in the Afromontane forests.</p>

The effect of these changes on animal survival is evaluated using the Metabolic Index (Φ), a measure of scope for aerobic activity governed by organismal traits sampled in diverse modern species. Modeled loss of aerobic habitat predicts lower extinction intensity in the tropics, a pattern confirmed with a spatially explicit analysis of the marine fossil record. The combined physiological stresses of ocean warming and O<sub>2</sub> loss can account for more than half the magnitude of the “Great Dying.”</p>

Here, we show that lipid biomarkers extracted from organically preserved Ediacaran macrofossils unambiguously clarify their phylogeny. <i>Dickinsonia</i> and its relatives solely produced cholesteroids, a hallmark of animals. Our results make these iconic members of the Ediacara biota the oldest confirmed macroscopic animals in the rock record, indicating that the appearance of the Ediacara biota was indeed a prelude to the Cambrian explosion of animal life.</p>

Here we present sulfur-isotope data that record a positive 1 per mil excursion during the PETM. Modeling suggests that large parts of the ocean must have become sulfidic. The toxicity of hydrogen sulfide will render two of the largest and least explored ecosystems on Earth, the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones, uninhabitable by multicellular organisms. This will affect many marine species whose ecozones stretch into the deep ocean.</p>

Friction at the bed does not control fast glacier flow
<p>The largest uncertainty in the ice sheet models used to predict future sea level rise originates from our limited understanding of processes at the ice/bed interface. Near glacier termini, where basal sliding controls ice flow, most predictive ice sheet models use a parameterization of sliding that has been theoretically derived for glacier flow over a hard bed. We find that this sliding relation does not apply to the 140 Greenland glaciers that we analyzed. There is no relationship between basal sliding and frictional stress at the glacier bed, contrary to theoretical predictions. There is a strong relationship between sliding speed and net pressure at the glacier bed. This latter finding is in agreement with earlier observations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mountain</span></strong> glaciers that have been largely overlooked by the glaciological community.</p>

Organic matter preserved in 3-billion-year-old mudstones at Gale crater, Mars
<p>Establishing the presence and state of organic matter, including its possible biosignatures, in martian materials has been an elusive quest, despite limited reports of the existence of organic matter on Mars. We report the in situ detection of organic matter preserved in lacustrine mudstones at the base of the ~3.5-billion-year-old Murray formation at Pahrump Hills, Gale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong>, by the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite onboard the Curiosity rover. Diverse pyrolysis products, including thiophenic, aromatic, and aliphatic compounds released at high temperatures (500° to 820°C), were directly detected by evolved gas analysis. Thiophenes were also observed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Their presence suggests that sulfurization aided organic matter preservation. At least 50 nanomoles of organic carbon persists, probably as macromolecules containing 5% carbon as organic sulfur molecules.</p>

Background levels of methane in Mars’ atmosphere show strong seasonal variations
<p>Variable levels of methane in the martian atmosphere have eluded explanation partly because the measurements are not repeatable in time or location. We report in situ measurements at Gale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crater</span></strong> made over a 5-year period by the Tunable Laser Spectrometer on the Curiosity rover. The background levels of methane have a mean value 0.41 ± 0.16 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) (95% confidence interval) and exhibit a strong, repeatable seasonal variation (0.24 to 0.65 ppbv). This variation is greater than that predicted from either ultraviolet degradation of impact-delivered organics on the surface or from the annual surface pressure cycle. The large seasonal variation in the background and occurrences of higher temporary spikes (~7 ppbv) are consistent with small localized sources of methane released from martian surface or subsurface reservoirs.</p>

Assessing whether the 2017 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 5.4 Pohang earthquake in South Korea was an induced event
<p>The moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 5.4 Pohang earthquake, the most damaging event in South Korea since instrumental seismic observation began in 1905, occurred beneath the Pohang geothermal power plant in 2017. Geological and geophysical data suggest that the Pohang earthquake was induced by fluid from an enhanced geothermal system (EGS) site, which was injected directly into a near-critically stressed subsurface fault zone. The magnitude of the mainshock makes it the largest known induced earthquake at an EGS site.</p>

Rapid sea level rise in the aftermath of a Neoproterozoic snowball Earth
<p>Earth’s most severe climate changes occurred during global-scale “snowball Earth” glaciations, which profoundly altered the planet’s atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere. Extreme rates of glacioeustatic sea level rise are predicted by the snowball Earth hypothesis, but supporting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ic evidence has been lacking. We use paleohydraulic analysis of wave ripples and tidal laminae in the Elatina Formation, Australia—deposited after the Marinoan glaciation ~635 million years ago—to show that water depths of 9 to 16 meters remained nearly constant for ~100 years throughout 27 meters of sediment accumulation. This accumulation rate was too great to have been accommodated by subsidence and instead indicates an extraordinarily rapid rate of sea level rise (0.2 to 0.27 meters per year). Our results substantiate a fundamental prediction of snowball Earth models of rapid deglaciation during the early transition to a supergreenhouse climate.</p>

Egg accumulation with 3D embryos provides insight into the life history of a pterosaur
<p>Fossil eggs and embryos that provide unique information about the reproduction and early growth of vertebrates are exceedingly rare, particularly for pterosaurs. Here we report on hundreds of three-dimensional (3D) eggs of the species <i>Hamipterus tianshanensis</i> from a Lower Cretaceous site in China, 16 of which contain embryonic remains. Computed tomography scanning, osteohistology, and micropreparation reveal that some bones lack extensive ossification in potentially late-term embryos, suggesting that hatchlings might have been flightless and less precocious than previously assumed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical context, including at least four levels with embryos and eggs, indicates that this deposit was formed by a rare combination of events, with storms acting on a nesting ground. This discovery supports colonial nesting behavior and potential nesting site fidelity in the Pterosauria.</p>

Cordilleran Ice Sheet mass loss preceded climate reversals near the Pleistocene Termination
<p>The Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS) once covered an area comparable to that of Greenland. Previous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ic evidence and numerical models indicate that the ice sheet covered much of westernmost Canada as late as 12.5 thousand years ago (ka). New data indicate that substantial areas throughout westernmost Canada were ice free prior to 12.5 ka and some as early as 14.0 ka, with implications for climate dynamics and the timing of meltwater discharge to the Pacific and Arctic oceans. Early Bølling-Allerød warmth halved the mass of the CIS in as little as 500 years, causing 2.5 to 3.0 meters of sea-level rise. Dozens of cirque and valley glaciers, along with the southern margin of the CIS, advanced into recently deglaciated regions during the Bølling-Allerød and Younger Dryas.</p>

Spaceborne detection of localized carbon dioxide sources

A transect passing directly downwind of the persistent isolated natural CO<sub>2</sub> plume from Yasur <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong> (Vanuatu) shows a narrow filament of enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> values (~3.4 parts per million), consistent with a CO<sub>2</sub> point source emitting 41.6 kilotons per day.

‘Supergenes’ drive evolution

Biologists are beginning to recognize the power of these DNA hiccups to drive evolution by freeing whole segments of the genome, containing multiple genes, from certain evolutionary constraints. As researchers discussed last month at the 16th Congress of the European Society of Evolutionary Biology in Groningen, the Netherlands, these evolutionary drivers have diverse and far-reaching roles in adaptation and evolution across many groups of organisms. </p>

Imaging the distribution of transient viscosity after the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.1 Kumamoto earthquake
<p>The deformation of mantle and crustal rocks in response to stress plays a crucial role in the distribution of seismic and volcanic hazards, controlling tectonic processes ranging from continental drift to earthquake triggering. However, the spatial variation of these dynamic properties is poorly understood as they are difficult to measure. We exploited the large stress perturbation incurred by the 2016 earthquake sequence in Kumamoto, Japan, to directly image localized and distributed deformation. The earthquakes illuminated distinct regions of low effective viscosity in the lower crust, notably beneath the Mount Aso and Mount Kuju <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>es, surrounded by larger-scale variations of viscosity across the back-arc. This study demonstrates a new potential for geodesy to directly probe rock rheology in situ across many spatial and temporal scales.</p>

Tungsten-182 heterogeneity in modern ocean island basalts

The tungsten isotopic data negatively correlate with <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He. These data indicate that each OIB system accesses domains within Earth that formed within the first 60 million years of solar system history. Combined isotopic and chemical characteristics projected for these ancient domains indicate that they contain metal and are repositories of noble gases. We suggest that the most likely source candidates are mega–ultralow-velocity zones, which lie beneath Hawaii, Samoa, and Iceland but not beneath hot spots whose OIB yield normal <sup>182</sup>W and homogeneously low <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He.</p>

Mars’ atmospheric history derived from upper-atmosphere measurements of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar
<p>The history of Mars’ atmosphere is important for understanding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ical evolution and potential habitability of the planet. We determine the amount of gas lost to space through time using measurements of the upper-atmospheric structure made by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft. We derive the structure of <sup>38</sup>Ar/<sup>36</sup>Ar between the homopause and exobase altitudes. Fractionation of argon occurs as a result of loss of gas to space by pickup-ion sputtering, which preferentially removes the lighter atom. The measurements require that 66% of the atmospheric argon has been lost to space. Thus, a large fraction of Mars’ atmospheric gas has been lost to space, contributing to the transition in climate from an early, warm, wet environment to today’s cold, dry atmosphere.</p>

Surface changes on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko suggest a more active past
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft spent ~2 years orbiting comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, most of it at distances that allowed surface characterization and monitoring at submeter scales. From December 2014 to June 2016, numerous localized changes were observed, which we attribute to cometary-specific weathering, erosion, and transient events driven by exposure to sunlight and other processes. While the localized changes suggest compositional or physical heterogeneity, their scale has not resulted in substantial alterations to the comet’s landscape. This suggests that most of the major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">landform</span></strong>s were created early in the comet’s current orbital configuration. They may even date from earlier if the comet had a larger volatile inventory, particularly of CO or CO<sub>2</sub> ices, or contained amorphous ice, which could have triggered activity at greater distances from the Sun.</p>

Building Archean cratons from Hadean mafic crust
<p>Geologic processing of Earth’s surface has removed most of the evidence concerning the nature of Earth’s first crust. One region of ancient crust is the Hudson Bay terrane of northeastern Canada, which is mainly composed of Neoarchean felsic crust and forms the nucleus of the Northeastern Superior Province. New data show these ~2.7-billion-year-old rocks to be the youngest to yield variability in neodymium-142 (<sup>142</sup>Nd), the decay product of short-lived samarium-146 (<sup>146</sup>Sm). Combined <sup>146-147</sup>Sm-<sup>142-143</sup>Nd data reveal that this large block of Archean crust formed by reworking of much older (>4.2 billion-year-old) mafic crust over a 1.5-billion-year interval of early Earth history. Thus, unlike on modern Earth, mafic crust apparently could survive for more than 1 billion years to form an important source rock for Archean crustal genesis.</p>

The geologic history of seawater pH
<p>Although pH is a fundamental property of Earth’s oceans, critical to our understanding of seawater biogeochemistry, its long-timescale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geolog</span></strong>ic history is poorly constrained. We constrain seawater pH through time by accounting for the cycles of the major components of seawater. We infer an increase from early Archean pH values between ~6.5 and 7.0 and Phanerozoic values between ~7.5 and 9.0, which was caused by a gradual decrease in atmospheric <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> in response to solar brightening, alongside a decrease in hydrothermal exchange between seawater and the ocean crust. A lower pH in Earth’s early oceans likely affected the kinetics of chemical reactions associated with the origin of life, the energetics of early metabolisms, and climate through the partitioning of CO<sub>2</sub> between the oceans and atmosphere.</p>

Experimental constraints on the damp peridotite solidus and oceanic mantle potential temperature
<p>Decompression of hot mantle rock upwelling beneath oceanic spreading centers causes it to exceed the melting point (solidus), producing magmas that ascend to form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">basalt</span></strong>ic crust ~6 to 7 kilometers thick. The oceanic upper mantle contains ~50 to 200 micrograms per gram of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) dissolved in nominally anhydrous minerals, which—relative to its low concentration—has a disproportionate effect on the solidus that has not been quantified experimentally. Here, we present results from an experimental determination of the peridotite solidus containing known amounts of dissolved hydrogen. Our data reveal that the H<sub>2</sub>O-undersaturated peridotite solidus is hotter than previously thought. Reconciling geophysical observations of the melting regime beneath the East Pacific Rise with our experimental results requires that existing estimates for the oceanic upper mantle potential temperature be adjusted upward by about 60°C.</p>

Lifetime of the solar nebula constrained by meteorite paleomagnetism

We present <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">paleomagnet</span></strong>ic analyses of volcanic angrites demonstrating that they formed in a near-zero magnetic field (<0.6 microtesla) at 4563.5 ± 0.1 million years ago, ~3.8 million years after solar system formation. This indicates that the solar nebula field, and likely the nebular gas, had dispersed by this time. This sets the time scale for formation of the gas giants and planet migration. Furthermore, it supports formation of chondrules after 4563.5 million years ago by non-nebular processes like planetesimal collisions. The core dynamo on the angrite parent body did not initiate until about 4 to 11 million years after solar system formation.</p>

These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-carbon-sulfur melt, accompanied by a thin fluid layer of methane ± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former calcium silicate perovskite. The metal-dominated mineral assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under metal-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a metallic iron phase that contains dissolved carbon and hydrogen.</p>

Combined with global cell distributions in marine sediments, these results indicate a strong contrast in sub–sea-floor prokaryote habitats: In continental margins, global cell numbers in sulfate-depleted sediment exceed those in the overlying sulfate-bearing sediment by one order of magnitude, whereas in the abyss, most life occurs in oxic and/or sulfate-reducing sediments.</p>

Photosynthetic Efficiency as Bioindicator of Environmental Pressure in <i>A. halleri</i>
<p>In earlier ecophysiological studies that were conducted on <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> plants, scientists focused on the mechanisms of Cd and Zn hyperaccumulation but did not take into consideration the environmental factors that can significantly affect the physiological responses of plants in situ. In this study, we investigated <i>A. halleri</i> that was growing on two nonmetalliferous and three metalliferous sites, which were characterized by different environmental conditions. We compared these populations in order to find differences within the metallicolous and nonmetallicolous groups that have not yet been investigated. The concentrations of several elements in the plant and soil samples also were investigated. To our knowledge, the concentration and fluorescence of chlorophyll were measured for <i>A. halleri</i> in situ for the first time. Our study confirmed the hyperaccumulation of Cd and Zn for each metallicolous population. For the metallicolous populations, the inhibition of parameters that describe the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus with increasing accumulations of heavy metals in the shoots also was observed. It was found that the nonmetallicolous plant populations from the summit of Ciemniak Mountain had larger antenna dimensions and chlorophyll content but a lower percentage of active reaction centers. To our knowledge, in this study, the internal high physiological diversity within the populations that inhabit metalliferous and nonmetalliferous sites is presented for the first time.</p>

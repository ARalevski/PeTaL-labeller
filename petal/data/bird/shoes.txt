Dynamic gating of infrared radiation in a textile
<p>The human body absorbs and loses heat largely through infrared radiation centering around a wavelength of 10 micrometers. However, neither our skin nor the textiles that make up <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cloth</span></strong>ing are capable of dynamically controlling this optical channel for thermal management. By coating triacetate-cellulose bimorph fibers with a thin layer of carbon nanotubes, we effectively modulated the infrared radiation by more than 35% as the relative humidity of the underlying skin changed. Both experiments and modeling suggest that this dynamic infrared gating effect mainly arises from distance-dependent electromagnetic coupling between neighboring coated fibers in the textile yarns. This effect opens a pathway for developing wearable localized thermal management systems that are autonomous and self-powered, as well as expanding our ability to adapt to demanding environments.</p>

ESCRTs offer repair service
<p>Repair or replace? Be it our stereos, our saucepans, or our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sock</span></strong>s, today's society encourages us to shun the repairman and toss damaged goods. Our cells face similar decisions when dealing with damaged organelles. Although they can be degraded through the process of autophagy, it seems that cells do not always go straight for the bin and instead employ some nifty tricks to stitch damaged organelles back together. On page 49 of this issue, Skowyra <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) expose an unexpected role for the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)â€“III machinery in repairing damaged endolysosomes, which has important consequences for the maintenance of organelle function and cell survival.</p>

Adaptive infrared-reflecting systems inspired by cephalopods
<p>Materials and systems that statically reflect radiation in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum underpin the performance of many entrenched technologies, including building insulation, energy-conserving windows, spacecraft components, electronics shielding, container packaging, protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cloth</span></strong>ing, and camouflage platforms. The development of their adaptive variants, in which the infrared-reflecting properties dynamically change in response to external stimuli, has emerged as an important unmet scientific challenge. By drawing inspiration from cephalopod skin, we developed adaptive infrared-reflecting platforms that feature a simple actuation mechanism, low working temperature, tunable spectral range, weak angular dependence, fast response, stability to repeated cycling, amenability to patterning and multiplexing, autonomous operation, robust mechanical properties, and straightforward manufacturability. Our findings may open opportunities for infrared camouflage and other technologies that regulate infrared radiation.</p>

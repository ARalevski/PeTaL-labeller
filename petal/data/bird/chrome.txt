Three-Year Outcomes With the Absorb Bioresorbable Scaffold
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) completely resorbs within 3 years after coronary artery implantation. The safety and effectiveness of BVS through this critical 3-year period have not been characterized.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an individual-patient-data pooled meta-analysis of the 4 randomized ABSORB trials in which 3389 patients with coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to everolimus-eluting Absorb BVS (n=2164) or cobalt-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromium</span></strong> everolimus-eluting stents (n=1225). The primary efficacy outcome measure was target lesion failure (cardiac mortality, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization), and the primary safety outcome measure was device thrombosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>BVS compared with cobalt-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromium</span></strong> everolimus-eluting stents resulted in higher 3-year rates of target lesion failure (11.7% versus 8.1%; risk ratio [RR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10–1.73; <i>P</i>=0.006), driven by greater target vessel myocardial infarction (7.8% versus 4.2%; RR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.26–2.35; <i>P</i>=0.0006) and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (6.6% versus 4.4%; RR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.05–1.98; <i>P</i>=0.02), with comparable cardiac mortality (1.1% versus 1.1%; RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.47–1.88; <i>P</i>=0.85). Device thrombosis rates through 3 years were also higher with BVS (2.4% versus 0.6%; RR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.70–8.11; <i>P</i>=0.001). Between 1 and 3 years, target lesion failure rates (6.1% versus 3.9%; <i>P</i>=0.02) and device thrombosis rates (1.1% versus 0.0%; <i>P</i><0.0001) were higher with BVS than cobalt-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromium</span></strong> everolimus-eluting stents.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In the present individual-patient-data pooled meta-analysis of the ABSORB trials, BVS was associated with increased rates of target lesion failure and device thrombosis between 1 and 3 years and cumulatively through 3 years of follow-up compared with everolimus-eluting stents.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Probing magnetism in 2D materials at the nanoscale with single-spin microscopy
<p>The discovery of ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals has generated widespread interest. Making further progress in this area requires quantitative knowledge of the magnetic properties of vdW magnets at the nanoscale. We used scanning single-spin magnetometry based on diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers to image the magnetization, localized defects, and magnetic domains of atomically thin crystals of the vdW magnet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromium</span></strong>(III) iodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>). We determined the magnetization of CrI<sub>3</sub> monolayers to be ≈16 Bohr magnetons per square nanometer, with comparable values in samples with odd numbers of layers; however, the magnetization vanishes when the number of layers is even. We also found that structural modifications can induce switching between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interlayer ordering. These results demonstrate the benefit of using single-spin scanning magnetometry to study the magnetism of 2D vdW magnets.</p>

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures
<p>Magnetic multilayer devices that exploit magnetoresistance are the backbone of magnetic sensing and data storage technologies. Here, we report multiple-spin-filter magnetic tunnel junctions (sf-MTJs) based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which atomically thin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromium</span></strong> triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) acts as a spin-filter tunnel barrier sandwiched between graphene contacts. We demonstrate tunneling magnetoresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for magnetic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures. Using magnetic circular dichroism measurements, we attribute these effects to the intrinsic layer-by-layer antiferromagnetic ordering of the atomically thin CrI<sub>3</sub>. Our work reveals the possibility to push magnetic information storage to the atomically thin limit and highlights CrI<sub>3</sub> as a superlative magnetic tunnel barrier for vdW heterostructure spintronic devices.</p>

Mild or moderate renal insufficiency does not increase circulating levels of cobalt and chromium in patients with metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To determine whether there is any association between glomerular   filtration rate (GFR) and blood cobalt (Co) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromium</span></strong> (Cr) levels   in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We identified 179 patients with a unilateral 36 mm diameter head   as part of a stemmed Summit-Pinnacle MoM hip arthroplasty. GFR was   calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Normal renal function (GFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was   seen in 74 patients. Mild renal insufficiency (GFR 60 to 89 ml/min/1.73   m<sup>2</sup>) was seen in 90 patients and moderate renal insufficiency   (GFR 30 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) in 15. There was no statistical   difference in Co and Cr levels between patients with normal renal   function and those with mild or moderate renal insufficiency. No   correlation was seen between creatinine and blood metal ion levels   or between GFR and blood metal ion levels. Linear regression analysis   did not show any association between Co and Cr levels and GFR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We did not find any association between GFR and blood metal ion   levels. Consequently, the accumulation of Co and Cr in blood due   to renal insufficiency does not seem to be a major risk in patients   with mild or moderate renal insufficiency.</p><p>Cite this article <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1147–52</p></sec>

Risk factors for wear-related failures after hip resurfacing in patients with a low contact patch to rim distance
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A contact patch to rim (CPR) distance of < 10 mm has been   associated with edge-loading and excessive wear. However, not all   arthroplasties with a low CPR distance show problems with wear.   Therefore, CPR distance may not be the only variable affecting the   post-operative metal ion concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We used multiple logistic regression to determine what variables   differed between the patients who had high and low cobalt (CoS)   and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromium</span></strong> (CrS) serum ion concentrations within a cohort of patients   with low (< 10 mm) CPR distances. A total of 56 patients treated   with unilateral hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) had CoS and CrS   ion studies performed more than one year after surgery. The mean   age of the patients at the time of surgery was 51.7 years (29 to   70), with 38 women (68%) and 18 men (32%).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>It was seen that 47 patients had low ion levels (< 7µg/L)   and nine had high ion levels (≥ 7µg/L). We found increased risks   of high wear with decreasing CPR distance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of CPR distance measurements to predict hips at risk   for elevated wear is needed for all patients with HRA. We recommend   that patients with low CPR distances have at least one serum ion   study performed while patients with CPR distance > 10 mm do not   need routine ion studies. We believe that patients with low CPR   distance and low ions do not need repeat ion studies unless the   patient becomes symptomatic or has substantial radiographic changes.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:865–71.</p></sec>

The use of femoral stems with exchangeable necks in primary total hip arthroplasty increases the rate of revision
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Femoral stems with exchangeable (modular) necks were introduced   to offer surgeons an increased choice when determining the version,   offset and length of the femoral neck during total hip arthroplasty   (THA). It was hoped that this would improve outcomes and reduce   complications, particularly dislocation. In 2010, the Australian Orthopaedic   Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) first   reported an increased rate of revision after primary THA using femoral   stems with an exchangeable neck. The aim of this study was to provide   a more comprehensive up-to-date analysis of primary THA using femoral   stems with exchangeable and fixed necks.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The data included all primary THA procedures performed for osteoarthritis   (OA), reported to the AOANJRR between 01 September 1999 and 31 December   2014. There were 9289 femoral stems with an exchangeable neck and   253 165 femoral stems with a fixed neck. The characteristics of   the patients and prostheses including the bearing surface and stem/neck   metal combinations were examined using Cox proportional hazard ratios   (HRs) and Kaplan-Meier estimates of survivorship. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>It was found that prostheses with an exchangeable neck had a   higher rate of revision and this was evident regardless of the bearing   surface or the size of the femoral head. Exchangeable neck prostheses   with a titanium stem and a cobalt-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromium</span></strong> neck had a significantly   higher rate of revision compared with titanium stem/titanium neck   combinations (HR 1.83, 95% confidence interval 1.49 to 2.23, p <   0.001). Revisions were higher for these combinations compared with   femoral stems with a fixed neck.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>There appears to be little evidence to support the continued   use of prostheses with an exchangeable neck in primary THA undertaken   for OA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:766–73.</p></sec>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal ions in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal ions in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluation)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluation).   Changes in ion levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regression model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal ions   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per billion (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal ions was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relationship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The levels of metal ions in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   metal ions be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.   While those with a MoM THA appear to stabilise at a certain level,   the accuracy of this trend is not yet clear. Vigilant follow-up   is still recommended. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):33–40.</p></sec>

A comparison study of stem taper material loss at similar and mixed metal head-neck taper junctions
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We sought to determine whether cobalt-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromium</span></strong> alloy (CoCr) femoral   stem tapers (trunnions) wear more than titanium (Ti) alloy stem   tapers (trunnions) when used in a large diameter (LD) metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip arthroplasty system.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed explant analysis using validated methodology to   determine the volumetric material loss at the taper surfaces of   explanted LD CoCr MoM hip arthroplasties used with either a Ti alloy   (n = 28) or CoCr femoral stem (n = 21). Only 12/14 taper constructs   with a rough male taper surface and a nominal included angle close   to 5.666° were included. Multiple regression modelling was undertaken   using taper angle, taper roughness, bearing diameter (horizontal   lever arm) as independent variables. Material loss was mapped using   a coordinate measuring machine, profilometry and scanning electron   microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After adjustment for other factors, CoCr stem tapers were found   to have significantly greater volumetric material loss than the   equivalent Ti stem tapers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When taper junction damage is identified during revision of a   LD MoM hip, it should be suspected that a male taper composed of   a standard CoCr alloy has sustained significant changes to the taper   cone geometry which are likely to be more extensive than those affecting   a Ti alloy stem.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1304–12.</p></sec>

Five-year follow-up of a prospective randomised trial comparing ceramic-on-metal and metal-on-metal bearing surfaces in total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>The primary aim of this independent prospective randomised trial   was to compare serum metal ion levels for ceramic-on-metal (CoM)   and metal-on-metal (MoM) bearing surfaces in total hip arthroplasty   (THA). Our one-year results demonstrated elevation in metal ion   levels above baseline with no significant difference between the   CoM and MoM groups. This paper reviews the five-year data.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The implants used in each patient differed only in respect to   the type of femoral head (ceramic or metal). At five-year follow-up   of the 83 enrolled patients, data from 67 (36 CoM, 31 MoM) was available   for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean serum cobalt (Co) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chromium</span></strong> (Cr) ion levels remained   above baseline in both groups (CoM: Co 1.16 μg/l (0.41 to 14.67),   Cr 1.05 μg/l (0.16 to 12.58); MoM: Co 2.93 μg/l (0.35 to 30.29),   Cr 1.85 μg/l (0.36 to 17.00)) but the increase was significantly   less in the CoM cohort (Co difference p = 0.001, Cr difference p   = 0.002). These medium-term results, coupled with lower revision   rates from national joint registries, suggest that the performance   of CoM THA may be superior to that of MoM. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While both bearing combinations have since been withdrawn these   results provide useful information for planning clinical surveillance   of CoM THAs and warrants continued monitoring.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1298–1303.</p></sec>

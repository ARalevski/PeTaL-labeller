Augmenting the osseointegration of endoprostheses using laser-sintered porous collars
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Massive endoprostheses rely on extra-cortical bone bridging (ECBB)   to enhance fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the   role of selective laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sinter</span></strong>ed (SLS) porous collars in augmenting   the osseointegration of these prostheses.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The two novel designs of porous SLS collars, one with small pores   (Ø700 μm, SP) and one with large pores (Ø1500 μm, LP), were compared   in an ovine tibial diaphyseal model. Osseointegration of these collars   was compared with that of a clinically used solid, grooved design   (G). At six months post-operatively, the ovine tibias were retrieved and   underwent radiological and histological analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Porous collars provided a significantly greater surface (p <   0.001) for the ingrowth of bone than the standard grooved design.   Significantly greater extracortical pedicle formation was seen radiologically   around the grooved design (length p = 0.002, thickness p < 0.001,   surface area p = 0.002) than around the porous collars. However,   the ingrowth of bone occurred from the transection site into the   porous structure of both types of collar. A fivefold increase in   integration was seen with the SP and a threefold increase in the   LP design when compared with G (p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SLS porous collars allow the direct ingrowth of more bone and   are better than current designs which rely on surface ongrowth and   ECBB.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:276–82.</p></sec>

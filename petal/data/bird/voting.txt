The effect of partisanship and political advertising on close family ties
<p>Research on growing American <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polit</span></strong>ical polarization and antipathy primarily studies public institutions and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polit</span></strong>ical processes, ignoring private effects, including strained family ties. Using anonymized smartphone-location data and precinct-level voting, we show that Thanksgiving dinners attended by residents from opposing-party precincts were 30 to 50 minutes shorter than same-party dinners. This decline from a mean of 257 minutes survives extensive spatial and demographic controls. Reductions in the duration of Thanksgiving dinner in 2016 tripled for travelers from media markets with heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polit</span></strong>ical advertising—an effect not observed in 2015—implying a relationship to election-related behavior. Effects appear asymmetric: Although fewer Democratic-precinct residents traveled in 2016 than in 2015, Republican-precinct residents shortened their Thanksgiving dinners by more minutes in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polit</span></strong>ical differences. Nationwide, 34 million hours of cross-partisan Thanksgiving dinner discourse were lost in 2016 owing to partisan effects.</p>

Replicating Meyerhoff for inclusive excellence in STEM
<p>Ethnic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ities comprise rapidly growing portions of the populations of most developed countries (<i>1</i>) but are underrepresented in fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). Efforts to increase diversity in the STEM workforce, important for developing more effective approaches to group problem-solving (<i>4</i>–<i>6</i>), have been under way in the United States for decades, but widespread impact remains relatively low (<i>3</i>). The Meyerhoff Scholars Program (MYS) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), provides a promising model for increasing retention and academic performance of underrepresented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ity (URM) undergraduates in STEM and for preparing those undergraduates to pursue and succeed in graduate and professional programs (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>). Although MYS is nearly 30 years old and outcomes for African-American STEM majors have been extensively documented [see (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and references therein], no other majority university [not meeting the definition of being a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ity-serving institution (MSI) (<i>9</i>)] has achieved similar outcomes (<i>10</i>). We describe here some promising early indicators that an interinstitutional partnership approach can help enable MYS-like outcomes at majority universities with different URM compositions, geographies, and institutional sizes and cultures: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and Pennsylvania State University at University Park (PSU).</p>

Fake news on Twitter during the 2016 U.S. presidential election
<p>The spread of fake news on social media became a public concern in the United States after the 2016 presidential election. We examined exposure to and sharing of fake news by registered voters on Twitter and found that engagement with fake news sources was extremely concentrated. Only 1% of individuals accounted for 80% of fake news source exposures, and 0.1% accounted for nearly 80% of fake news sources shared. Individuals most likely to engage with fake news sources were conservative leaning, older, and highly engaged with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polit</span></strong>ical news. A cluster of fake news sources shared overlapping audiences on the extreme right, but for people across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polit</span></strong>ical spectrum, most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polit</span></strong>ical news exposure still came from mainstream media outlets.</p>

Aurora B opposes PP1 function in mitosis by phosphorylating the conserved PP1-binding RVxF motif in PP1 regulatory proteins
<p>Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a highly conserved protein phosphatase that performs most of the serine- and threonine-dephosphorylation reactions in eukaryotes and opposes the actions of a diverse set of serine and threonine (Ser-Thr) protein kinases. PP1 gains substrate specificity through binding to a large number (>200) of regulatory proteins that control PP1 localization, activity, and interactions with substrates. PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF binding motif that is present in many of these regulatory proteins, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes. We showed that a subset of the RVxF binding motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable amino acid (RV[S/T]F), was phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory protein. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ed by the mitotic protein kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites maintained the phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis by disrupting the assembly of PP1 holoenzymes. We generated an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory proteins (KNL1, CDCA2, and RIF1) and multiple proteins that could potentially act as PP1 binding partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1, and ELYS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ed by this mechanism. Together, these data suggest a general regulatory mechanism by which the coordinated activities of Aurora B and PP1 control mitotic progression.</p>

Cytoskeletal adaptivity regulates T cell receptor signaling
<p>The factors that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong> T cell activation control the initiation and progression of adaptive immune responses. T cells recognize their cognate antigen on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through the T cell receptor, which results in the formation of a contact region (immune synapse) between the two cells and the activation of the T cells. Activated T cells proliferate and differentiate into effector T cells that secrete cytokines, provide help to B cells, and kill target cells. We asked whether the actin cytoskeleton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>s differences in signaling in effector T cells versus naive (unstimulated) T cells. Using atomic force microscopy and quantitative confocal microscopy, we found that naive T cells had a mechanically stiffer cortical cytoskeleton than that of effector cells, which resulted in naive cells forming smaller immune synapses with APCs. This suggests that the cytoskeletal stiffness of the T cell before it undergoes antigen stimulation predicts its subsequent dynamic engagement with APCs and its activation potential. Cytoskeletal rigidity depended on the activity of the actin-severing enzyme cofilin through a pathway requiring the small guanosine triphosphatase RhoA and the kinases ROCK (Rho-activated kinase) and LIMK. These findings suggest that the baseline cytoskeletal state controls T cell responses and that the underlying pathway could be a therapeutic target for modulating adaptive immunity.</p>

Measles epidemic in Ukraine drove troubling European year
<p>Measles cases surged to nearly 83,000 in Europe in 2018—a 21st-century record and more than triple number in 2017, the World Health Organization announced last week. Driving the number was a massive and growing outbreak in Ukraine, where more than 54,000 cases were reported in 2018 and more than 15,000 have been logged already in 2019. Measles is extremely contagious and vaccine-preventable. Its complications can kill.The Ukranian epidemic stems from a decade of vaccine resistance and from vaccine supply disruptions after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polit</span></strong>ical upheaval and armed conflict broke out in 2014. In 2016, just 31% of Ukranian 6-year-olds had received the recommended two measles shots—a rate among the lowest in the world. "It's egregious to have people have measles in the 21st century in a European country," says Ulana Suprun, Ukraine's acting minister of health, who is steering an urgent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ment response to the epidemic.</p>

Autonomous vehicles: No driver…no regulation?
<p>According to the latest statistics from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 37,461 people were killed on the nation's roads in 2016 (<i>1</i>). Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has the potential to reduce this number substantially. However, proper safeguards must be established immediately by federal regulators to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong> the testing and deployment of AVs and ensure public safety. We must not undermine current safety standards for the sake of AV development. Moreover, reconsidering current requirements may be necessary to take advantage of this revolution. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of respondents in a recent CARAVAN public opinion poll expressed concern about sharing the road with driverless cars (<i>2</i>). If commonsense protections are not in place to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong> AV development, and problems occur, the public will reject AVs, and the opportunity this new technology presents to improve public safety will be lost.</p>

Experimental evidence for tipping points in social convention
<p>Theoretical models of critical mass have shown how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ity groups can initiate social change dynamics in the emergence of new social conventions. Here, we study an artificial system of social conventions in which human subjects interact to establish a new coordination equilibrium. The findings provide direct empirical demonstration of the existence of a tipping point in the dynamics of changing social conventions. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ity groups reached the critical mass—that is, the critical group size for initiating social change—they were consistently able to overturn the established behavior. The size of the required critical mass is expected to vary based on theoretically identifiable features of a social setting. Our results show that the theoretically predicted dynamics of critical mass do in fact emerge as expected within an empirical system of social coordination.</p>

Natural selection interacts with recombination to shape the evolution of hybrid genomes
<p>To investigate the consequences of hybridization between species, we studied three replicate hybrid populations that formed naturally between two swordtail fish species, estimating their fine-scale genetic map and inferring ancestry along the genomes of 690 individuals. In all three populations, ancestry from the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>” parental species is more common in regions of high recombination and where there is linkage to fewer putative targets of selection. The same patterns are apparent in a reanalysis of human and archaic admixture. These results support models in which ancestry from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> parental species is more likely to persist when rapidly uncoupled from alleles that are deleterious in hybrids. Our analyses further indicate that selection on swordtail hybrids stems predominantly from deleterious combinations of epistatically interacting alleles.</p>

New Ebola outbreak rings alarm bells early
<p>An outbreak of Ebola in a remote region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has led to a swift and robust response from the country and the international community. In the wake of the devastating West African Ebola that spiraled out of control in 2014, there’s acute awareness that virus can cause mayhem if not contained early. This time, there’s also the possibility of using an unlicensed but promising vaccine that had great success in 2015 in a trial in Guinea. But given the confusing details of the DRC outbreak—the first case apparently fell ill 21 April and he’s only one of two confirmed cases to date—the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ment has yet to request the vaccine. And in collaboration with international partners, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ment is closely following several dozen suspect cases and more than 350 of their contacts to decide how best to stop spread. </p>

HIV infections are spiking among young gay Chinese

Loss of the Chloroplast Transit Peptide from an Ancestral C<sub>3</sub> Carbonic Anhydrase Is Associated with C<sub>4</sub> Evolution in the Grass Genus <i>Neurachne</i>
<p><i>Neurachne</i> is the only known grass lineage containing closely related C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate, and C<sub>4</sub> species, making it an ideal taxon with which to study the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in the grasses. To begin dissecting the molecular changes that led to the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in this group, the complementary DNAs encoding four distinct β-carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms were characterized from leaf tissue of <i>Neurachne munroi</i> (C<sub>4</sub>), <i>Neurachne <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong></i> (C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>), and <i>Neurachne alopecuroidea</i> (C<sub>3</sub>). Two genes (<i>CA1</i> and <i>CA2</i>) each encode two different isoforms: CA1a/CA1b and CA2a/CA2b. Transcript analyses found that <i>CA1</i> messenger RNAs were significantly more abundant than transcripts from the <i>CA2</i> gene in the leaves of each species examined, constituting ∼99% of all β-CA transcripts measured. Localization experiments using green fluorescent protein fusion constructs showed that, while CA1b is a cytosolic CA in all three species, the CA1a proteins are differentially localized. The <i>N. alopecuroidea</i> and <i>N. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong></i> CA1a isoforms were imported into chloroplasts of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf cells, whereas <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a localized to the cytosol. Sequence analysis indicated an 11-amino acid deletion in the amino terminus of <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a relative to the C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> proteins, suggesting that chloroplast targeting of CA1a is the ancestral state and that loss of a functional chloroplast transit peptide in <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a is associated with the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in <i>Neurachne</i> spp. Remarkably, this mechanism is homoplastic with the evolution of the C<sub>4</sub>-associated CA in the dicotyledonous genus <i>Flaveria</i>, although the actual mutations in the two lineages differ.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>Brachypodium</i> Links Vernalization and Flowering Time Loci as Major Flowering Determinants
<p>The domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favorable developmental traits, including flowering time, which resulted in the creation of varieties with altered growth habits. Research into the pathways underlying these growth habits in cereals has highlighted the role of three main flowering regulators: <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>VRN1</i>), <i>VRN2</i>, and <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>). Previous reverse genetic studies suggested that the roles of <i>VRN1</i> and <i>FT</i> are conserved in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> yet identified considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of <i>VRN2</i>. To investigate the natural diversity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ing flowering time pathways in a nondomesticated grass, the reference <i>B. distachyon</i> accession Bd21 was crossed with the vernalization-dependent accession ABR6. Resequencing of ABR6 allowed the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic map at the F4 stage of the mapping population. Flowering time was evaluated in F4:5 families in five environmental conditions, and three major loci were found to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong> flowering time. Interestingly, two of these loci colocalize with the <i>B. distachyon</i> homologs of the major flowering pathway genes <i>VRN2</i> and <i>FT</i>, whereas no linkage was observed at <i>VRN1</i>. Characterization of these candidates identified sequence and expression variation between the two parental genotypes, which may explain the contrasting growth habits. However, the identification of additional quantitative trait loci suggests that greater complexity underlies flowering time in this nondomesticated system. Studying the interaction of these regulators in <i>B. distachyon</i> provides insights into the evolutionary context of flowering time regulation in the Poaceae as well as elucidates the way humans have utilized the natural variation present in grasses to create modern temperate cereals.</p>

Reversible Leaf Xylem Collapse: A Potential “Circuit Breaker” against Cavitation
<p>We report a novel form of xylem dysfunction in angiosperms: reversible collapse of the xylem conduits of the smallest vein orders that demarcate and intrusively irrigate the areoles of red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy revealed gradual increases in collapse from approximately −2 MPa down to −3 MPa, saturating thereafter (to −4 MPa). Over this range, cavitation remained negligible in these veins. Imaging of rehydration experiments showed spatially variable recovery from collapse within 20 s and complete recovery after 2 min. More broadly, the patterns of deformation induced by desiccation in both mesophyll and xylem suggest that cell wall collapse is unlikely to depend solely on individual wall properties, as mechanical constraints imposed by neighbors appear to be important. From the perspective of equilibrium leaf water potentials, petioles, whose vessels extend into the major veins, showed a vulnerability to cavitation that overlapped in the water potential domain with both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> vein collapse and buckling (turgor loss) of the living cells. However, models of transpiration transients showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> vein collapse and mesophyll capacitance could effectively buffer major veins from cavitation over time scales relevant to the rectification of stomatal wrong-way responses. We suggest that, for angiosperms, whose subsidiary cells give up large volumes to allow large stomatal apertures at the cost of potentially large wrong-way responses, vein collapse could make an important contribution to these plants’ ability to transpire near the brink of cavitation-inducing water potentials.</p>

Evaluation of Codon Biology in <i>Citrus</i> and <i>Poncirus trifoliata</i> Based on Genomic Features and Frame Corrected Expressed Sequence Tags
<p><i>Citrus</i>, as one of the globally important fruit trees, has been an object of interest for understanding genetics and evolutionary process in fruit crops. Meta-analyses of 19 <i>Citrus</i> species, including 4 globally and economically important <i>Citrus sinensis</i>, <i>Citrus clementina</i>, <i>Citrus reticulata</i>, and 1 <i>Citrus</i> relative <i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>, were performed. We observed that codons ending with A- or T- at the wobble position were preferred in contrast to C- or G- ending codons, indicating a close association with AT richness of <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. The present study postulates a large repertoire of a set of optimal codons for the <i>Citrus</i> genus and <i>P. trifoliata</i> and demonstrates that GCT and GGT are evolutionary conserved optimal codons. Our observation suggested that mutational bias is the dominating force in shaping the codon usage bias (CUB) in <i>Citrus</i> and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. Correspondence analysis (COA) revealed that the principal axis [axis 1; COA/relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)] contributes only a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> portion (∼10.96%) of the recorded variance. In all analysed species, except <i>P. trifoliata</i>, Gravy and aromaticity played <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> roles in resolving CUB. Compositional constraints were found to be strongly associated with the amino acid signatures in <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. Our present analysis postulates compositional constraints in <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i> and plausible role of the stress with GC<sub>3</sub> and coevolution pattern of amino acid.</p>

Cytosolic DNA Sensing Promotes Macrophage Transformation and Governs Myocardial Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardium irreversibly injured by ischemic stress must be efficiently repaired to maintain tissue integrity and contractile performance.

These cells transform across a spectrum of phenotypes to accomplish diverse functions ranging from mediating the initial inflammatory responses that clear damaged tissue to subsequent reparative functions that help rebuild replacement tissue. Although macrophage transformation is crucial to myocardial repair, events <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ing this transformation are poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we set out to determine whether innate immune responses triggered by cytoplasmic DNA play a role.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We report that ischemic myocardial injury, along with the resulting release of nucleic acids, activates the recently described cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Animals lacking cyclic GMP-AMP synthase display significantly improved early survival after myocardial infarction and diminished pathological remodeling, including ventricular rupture, enhanced angiogenesis, and preserved ventricular contractile function. Furthermore, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase loss of function abolishes the induction of key inflammatory programs such as inducible nitric oxide synthase and promotes the transformation of macrophages to a reparative phenotype, which results in enhanced repair and improved hemodynamic performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results reveal, for the first time, that the cytosolic DNA receptor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase functions during cardiac ischemia as a pattern recognition receptor in the sterile immune response.

Soluble and Membrane-Bound β-Glucosidases Are Involved in Trimming the Xyloglucan Backbone
<p>In many flowering plants, xyloglucan is a major component of primary cell walls, where it plays an important role in growth regulation. Xyloglucan can be degraded by a suite of exoglycosidases that remove specific sugars. In this work, we show that the xyloglucan backbone, formed by (1→4)-linked β-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl residues, can be attacked by two different Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) β-glucosidases from glycoside hydrolase family 3. While BGLC1 (At5g20950; for β-glucosidase active against xyloglucan 1) is responsible for all or most of the soluble activity, BGLC3 (At5g04885) is usually a membrane-anchored protein. Mutations in these two genes, whether on their own or combined with mutations in other exoglycosidase genes, resulted in the accumulation of partially digested xyloglucan subunits, such as GXXG, GXLG, or GXFG. While a mutation in <i>BGLC1</i> had significant effects on its own, lack of <i>BGLC3</i> had only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> effects. On the other hand, double <i>bglc1 bglc3</i> mutants revealed a synergistic interaction that supports a role for membrane-bound BGLC3 in xyloglucan metabolism. In addition, <i>bglc1 bglc3</i> was complemented by overexpression of either <i>BGLC1</i> or <i>BGLC3</i>. In overexpression lines, BGLC3 activity was concentrated in a microsome-enriched fraction but also was present in soluble form. Finally, both genes were generally expressed in the same cell types, although, in some cases, <i>BGLC3</i> was expressed at earlier stages than <i>BGLC1</i>. We propose that functional specialization could explain the separate localization of both enzymes, as a membrane-bound β-glucosidase could specifically digest soluble xyloglucan without affecting the wall-bound polymer.</p>

CNGC2 Is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> Influx Channel That Prevents Accumulation of Apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the Leaf
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is absorbed by roots and transported upward through the xylem to the apoplastic space of the leaf, after which it is deposited into the leaf cell. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the tonoplast-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transporters CATION EXCHANGER1 (CAX1) and CAX3 sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the vacuole, but it is not known what transporter mediates the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the apoplast to the cytosol. Here, we report that Arabidopsis <i>CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNEL2</i> (<i>CNGC2</i>) encodes a protein with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx channel activity and is expressed in the leaf areas surrounding the free endings of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> veins, which is the primary site for Ca<sup>2+</sup> unloading from the vasculature and influx into leaf cells. Under hydroponic growth conditions, with 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup>, both Arabidopsis <i>cngc2</i> and <i>cax1cax3</i> loss-of-function mutants grew normally. Increasing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 10 m<sc>m</sc> induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, cell death, and leaf senescence and partially suppressed the hypersensitive response to avirulent pathogens in the mutants but not in the wild type. In vivo apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> overaccumulation was found in the leaves of <i>cngc2</i> and <i>cax1cax</i>3 but not the wild type under the 10 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition, as monitored by Oregon Green BAPTA 488 5N, a low-affinity and membrane-impermeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe. Our results indicate that CNGC2 likely has no direct roles in leaf development or the hypersensitive response but, instead, that CNGC2 could mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into leaf cells. Finally, the in vivo extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging method developed in this study provides a new tool for investigating Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in plant cells.</p>

Distinct Mechanisms of the ORANGE Protein in Controlling Carotenoid Flux
<p>β-Carotene adds nutritious value and determines the color of many fruits, including melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>). In melon mesocarp, β-carotene accumulation is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ed by the <i>Orange</i> gene (<i>CmOr</i>) golden single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) through a yet to be discovered mechanism. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), OR increases carotenoid levels by posttranscriptionally regulating phytoene synthase (PSY). Here, we identified a <i>CmOr</i> nonsense mutation (<i>Cmor</i>-lowβ) that lowered fruit β-carotene levels with impaired chromoplast biogenesis. <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ exerted a minimal effect on <i>PSY</i> transcripts but dramatically decreased PSY protein levels and enzymatic activity, leading to reduced carotenoid metabolic flux and accumulation. However, the golden SNP was discovered to not affect PSY protein levels and carotenoid metabolic flux in melon fruit, as shown by carotenoid and immunoblot analyses of selected melon genotypes and by using chemical pathway inhibitors. The high β-carotene accumulation in golden SNP melons was found to be due to a reduced further metabolism of β-carotene. This was revealed by genetic studies with double mutants including <i>carotenoid isomerase</i> (<i>yofi</i>), a carotenoid-isomerase nonsense mutant, which arrests the turnover of prolycopene. The <i>yofi</i> F2 segregants accumulated prolycopene independently of the golden SNP. Moreover, <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ was found to inhibit chromoplast formation and chloroplast disintegration in fruits from 30 d after anthesis until ripening, suggesting that <i>CmOr</i> regulates the chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition. Taken together, our results demonstrate that <i>CmOr</i> is required to achieve PSY protein levels to maintain carotenoid biosynthesis metabolic flux but that the mechanism of the <i>CmOr</i> golden SNP involves an inhibited metabolism downstream of β-carotene to dramatically affect both carotenoid content and plastid fate.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Two Different Transcripts of a LAMMER Kinase Gene Play Opposite Roles in Disease Resistance
<p>Alternative splicing of genes can increase protein diversity and affect mRNA stability. Genome-wide transcriptome sequencing has demonstrated that alternative splicing occurs in a large number of intron-containing genes of different species. However, despite the phenomenon having been known for decades, it is largely unknown how the alternatively spliced transcripts function differently. Here, we report that two alternatively spliced transcripts of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) LAMMER kinase gene <i>OsDR11</i>, long <i>OsDR11L</i> and short <i>OsDR11S</i>, play opposite roles in rice resistance against <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>), which causes the most damaging bacterial disease in rice worldwide. Overexpressing <i>OsDR11S</i> or suppressing <i>OsDR11L</i> in rice enhanced resistance to <i>Xoo</i>, which was accompanied by an accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes. In contrast, suppressing <i>OsDR11S</i> was associated with increased susceptibility to <i>Xoo</i>, along with decreased levels of JA and expression of JA signaling genes. The OsDR11S and OsDR11L proteins colocalized in the nucleus. OsDR11L showed autophosphorylation activity in vitro, while OsDR11S did not. In the presence of OsDR11S, autophosphorylation of OsDR11L was inhibited, and overexpression of <i>OsDR11S</i> suppressed <i>OsDR11L</i> expression. <i>OsDR11</i> appeared to contribute to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> quantitative trait locus against <i>Xoo</i>. These results suggest that OsDR11L is a negative regulator in rice disease resistance, which may be associated with suppression of JA signaling. The results also suggest that OsDR11S may inhibit the function of OsDR11L at both the transcription and protein kinase activity levels, leading to resistance against <i>Xoo</i>.</p>

Hydrocarbons Are Essential for Optimal Cell Size, Division, and Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>Cyanobacteria are intricately organized, incorporating an array of internal thylakoid membranes, the site of photosynthesis, into cells no larger than other bacteria. They also synthesize C15-C19 alkanes and alkenes, which results in substantial production of hydrocarbons in the environment. All sequenced cyanobacteria encode hydrocarbon biosynthesis pathways, suggesting an important, undefined physiological role for these compounds. Here, we demonstrate that hydrocarbon-deficient mutants of <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 and <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 exhibit significant phenotypic differences from wild type, including enlarged cell size, reduced growth, and increased division defects. Photosynthetic rates were similar between strains, although a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> reduction in energy transfer between the soluble light harvesting phycobilisome complex and membrane-bound photosystems was observed. Hydrocarbons were shown to accumulate in thylakoid and cytoplasmic membranes. Modeling of membranes suggests these compounds aggregate in the center of the lipid bilayer, potentially promoting membrane flexibility and facilitating curvature. In vivo measurements confirmed that <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 mutants lacking hydrocarbons exhibit reduced thylakoid membrane curvature compared to wild type. We propose that hydrocarbons may have a role in inducing the flexibility in membranes required for optimal cell division, size, and growth, and efficient association of soluble and membrane bound proteins. The recent identification of C15-C17 alkanes and alkenes in microalgal species suggests hydrocarbons may serve a similar function in a broad range of photosynthetic organisms.</p>

Similar specificities of symbiont uptake by adults and larvae in an anemone model system for coral biology
<p>Reef-building corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus <i>Symbiodinium</i>) that live within their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ing the specificity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone <i>Aiptasia</i> as an experimentally tractable model system to analyze the specificity and timing of symbiosis onset in larval and adult animals under controlled laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic <i>Symbiodinium</i> strains, we found no difference in uptake specificity between larvae (even when very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal strains were found within the larval guts, only the former appeared to be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible algae) proliferated rapidly within the larvae in the absence of detectable exchange with other larvae. Older larvae showed reduced ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of food failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus, <i>Aiptasia</i> adults and larvae appear to have similar mechanisms for discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during years of axenic culture in the absence of a host. These studies provide a foundation for future analyses of the mechanisms of symbiont-uptake specificity in this emerging model system.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Antioxidants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as antioxidants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

We sought to evaluate the availability and use of shared data from cardiometabolic clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We extracted data from ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com, a large, multisponsor data-sharing platform hosting individual patient–level data from completed studies sponsored by 13 pharmaceutical companies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From January 2013 to May 2017, the platform had data from 3374 clinical trials, of which 537 (16%) evaluated cardiometabolic therapeutics (phase 1, 36%; phase 2, 17%; phase 2/3, 1%; phase 3, 42%; phase 4, 4%). They covered 74 therapies and 398 925 patients. Diabetes mellitus (60%) and hypertension (15%) were the most common study topics. Median time from study completion to data availability was 79 months. As of May 2017, ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com had received 318 submitted proposals, of which 163 had signed data-sharing agreements. Thirty of these proposals were related to cardiometabolic therapies and requested data from 79 unique studies (15% of all trials, 29% of phase 3/4 trials). Most (96%) data requesters of cardiometabolic clinical trial data were from academic centers in North America and Western Europe, and half the proposals were unfunded. Most proposals were for secondary hypothesis-generating questions, with only 1 proposed reanalysis of the original study primary hypothesis. To date, 3 peer-reviewed articles have been published after a median of 19 months (9–32 months) from the data-sharing agreement.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite availability of data from >500 cardiometabolic trials in a multisponsor data-sharing platform, only 15% of these trials and 29% of phase 3/4 trials have been accessed by investigators thus far, and a negligible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ity of analyses have reached publication.</p></sec>

Chronic Rejection of Cardiac Allografts Is Associated With Increased Lymphatic Flow and Cellular Trafficking
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an excellent treatment for end-stage heart disease. However, rejection of the donor graft, in particular, by chronic rejection leading to cardiac allograft vasculopathy, remains a major cause of graft loss. The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in the alloimmune response, facilitating trafficking of antigen-presenting cells to draining lymph nodes. The encounter of antigen-presenting cells with T lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid organs is essential for the initiation of alloimmunity. Donor lymphatic vessels are not anastomosed to that of the recipient during transplantation. The pathophysiology of lymphatic disruption is unknown, and whether this disruption enhances or hinders the alloimmune responses is unclear. Although histological analysis of lymphatic vessels in donor grafts can yield information on the structure of the lymphatics, the function following cardiac transplantation is poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography lymphoscintigraphy, we quantified the lymphatic flow index following heterotrophic cardiac transplantation in a murine model of chronic rejection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Ten weeks following transplantation of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> antigen (HY) sex-mismatched heart graft, the lymphatic flow index was significantly increased in comparison with sex-matched controls. Furthermore, the enhanced lymphatic flow index correlated with an increase in donor cells in the mediastinal draining lymph nodes; increased lymphatic vessel area; and graft infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD68<sup>+</sup> macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Chronic rejection results in increased lymphatic flow from the donor graft to draining lymph nodes, which may be a factor in promoting cellular trafficking, alloimmunity, and cardiac allograft vasculopathy.</p></sec>

Primary Myocardial Fibrosis as an Alternative Phenotype Pathway of Inherited Cardiac Structural Disorders
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial fibrosis is a common postmortem finding among young individuals with sudden cardiac death. Because there is no known single cause, we tested the hypothesis that some cases of myocardial fibrosis in the absence of identifiable causes (primary myocardial fibrosis [PMF]) are associated with genetic variants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Tissue was obtained at autopsy from 4031 consecutive individuals with sudden cardiac death in Northern Finland, among whom PMF was the only structural finding in 145 subjects with sudden cardiac death. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing using a panel of 174 genes associated with myocardial structure and ion channel function when autopsies did not identify a secondary basis for myocardial fibrosis. All variants with an effect on protein and with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> allele frequency <0.01 were classified as pathogenic or variants of uncertain significance on the basis of American College of Medical Genetics consensus guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 96 specimens with DNA passing quality control (66%), postmortem genetic tests identified 24 variants of known or uncertain significance in 26 subjects (27%). Ten were pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 10 subjects (10%), and 14 were variants of uncertain significance in 11 genes among 16 subjects (17%). Five variants were in genes associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, 6 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy–associated genes, and 11 in dilated cardiomyopathy–associated genes; 2 were not associated with these disorders. Four unique variants of uncertain significance cosegregated among multiple unrelated subjects with PMF. No pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were detected in ion channel–encoding genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A large proportion of subjects with PMF at autopsy had variants in genes associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without autopsy findings of those diseases, suggesting that PMF can be an alternative phenotypic expression of structural disease–associated genetic variants or that risk-associated fibrosis was expressing before the primary disease. These findings have clinical implications for postmortem genetic testing and family risk profiling.</p></sec>

Randomized Comparisons of Double-Dose Clopidogrel or Adjunctive Cilostazol Versus Standard Dual Antiplatelet in Patients With High Posttreatment Platelet Reactivity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention react differently to antiplatelet drugs. Those with low responsiveness to clopidogrel have a higher risk of cardiac ischemic events. The goal of this study is to conduct a head-to-head comparison of the safety and effectiveness of intensified antiplatelet therapies (either double-dose clopidogrel [DOUBLE] or adjunctive cilostazol [TRIPLE]) and conventional strategy (STANDARD) in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized, controlled trial, we used thromboelastography, a platelet function test, to select 1078 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention at high thrombotic risk and compared the intensified antiplatelet therapies with standard antiplatelet therapy. The primary outcome was the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at 18 months after percutaneous coronary intervention, defined as a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, or stroke. Bleeding Academic Research Consortium defined bleeding complications (types 1, 2, 3, or 5) were the safety end points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The primary end point occurred in 52 patients (14.4%) in the STANDARD group, 38 patients (10.6%) in the DOUBLE group, and 30 patients (8.5%) in the TRIPLE group (hazard ratio, 0.720; 95% confidence interval, 0.474–1.094, DOUBLE versus STANDARD; hazard ratio, 0.550; 95% confidence interval, 0.349–0.866, TRIPLE versus STANDARD). No significant difference in the rates of major bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium grade≥3) was found in the DOUBLE group (3.34% versus 1.93% in STANDARD, <i>P</i>=0.133) and the TRIPLE group (2.53% versus 1.93% in STANDARD, <i>P</i>=0.240). The rate of Bleeding Academic Research Consortium–defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> bleeding increased in the DOUBLE group (27.4% versus 20.3% in STANDARD, <i>P</i>=0.031), but not in the TRIPLE group (23.6% versus 20.3% in STANDARD, <i>P</i>=0.146).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with low responsiveness to clopidogrel, as measured by thromboelastography, the intensified antiplatelet strategies with adjunctive use of cilostazol significantly improved the clinical outcomes without increasing the risk of major bleeding. Decreased trend of negative outcomes could be observed in patients with double dosage of clopidogrel, but the difference was not significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Risk Factors of Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prevention of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the young remains a largely unsolved public health problem, and sports activity is an established trigger. Although the presence of standard cardiovascular risk factors in the young can link to future morbidity and mortality in adulthood, the potential contribution of these risk factors to SCA in the young has not been evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively ascertained subjects who experienced SCA between the ages of 5 and 34 years in the Portland, Oregon, metro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polit</span></strong>an area (2002–2015, catchment population ≈1 million). We assessed the circumstances, resuscitation outcomes, and clinical profile of subjects who had SCA by a detailed evaluation of emergency response records, lifetime clinical records, and autopsy examinations. We specifically evaluated the association of standard cardiovascular risk factors and SCA, and sports as a trigger for SCA in the young.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 3775 SCAs in all age groups, 186 (5%) occurred in the young (mean age 25.9±6.8, 67% male). In SCA in the young, overall prevalence of warning signs before SCA was low (29%), and 26 (14%) were associated with sports as a trigger. The remainder (n=160) occurred in other settings categorized as nonsports. Sports-related SCAs accounted for 39% of SCAs in patients aged ≤18, 13% of SCAs in patients aged 19 to 25, and 7% of SCAs in patients aged 25 to 34. Sports-related SCA cases were more likely to present with shockable rhythms, and survival from cardiac arrest was 2.5-fold higher in sports-related versus nonsports SCA (28% versus 11%; <i>P</i>=0.05). Overall, the most common SCA-related conditions were sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (31%), coronary artery disease (22%), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (14%). There was an unexpectedly high overall prevalence of established cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking) with ≥1 risk factors in 58% of SCA cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Sports was a trigger of SCA in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ity of cases, and, in most patients, SCA occurred without warning symptoms. Standard cardiovascular risk factors were found in over half of patients, suggesting the potential role of public health approaches that screen for cardiovascular risk factors at earlier ages.</p></sec>

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of diagnosis were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in <i>BMPR2</i> were identified in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at diagnosis (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutation carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be identified reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at diagnosis suggests the underlying molecular diagnosis. Genetic testing can identify these misclassified patients, allowing appropriate management and early referral for lung transplantation.</p></sec>

Physiology of Angina and Its Alleviation With Nitroglycerin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong>ing exercise-induced angina and its alleviation by the most commonly used antianginal drug, nitroglycerin, are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a method by which the effects of antianginal drugs could be evaluated invasively during physiological exercise to gain further understanding of the clinical impact of angina and nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty patients (mean age, 65.2±7.6 years) with exertional angina and coronary artery disease underwent cardiac catheterization via radial access and performed incremental exercise using a supine cycle ergometer. As they developed limiting angina, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered to half the patients, and all patients continued to exercise for 2 minutes at the same workload. Throughout exercise, distal coronary pressure and flow velocity and central aortic pressure were recorded with sensor wires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients continued to exercise after nitroglycerin administration with less ST-segment depression (<i>P</i>=0.003) and therefore myocardial ischemia. Significant reductions in afterload (aortic pressure, <i>P</i>=0.030) and myocardial oxygen demand were seen (tension-time index, <i>P</i>=0.024; rate-pressure product, <i>P</i>=0.046), as well as an increase in myocardial oxygen supply (Buckberg index, <i>P</i>=0.017). Exercise reduced peripheral arterial wave reflection (<i>P</i><0.05), which was not further augmented by the administration of nitroglycerin (<i>P</i>=0.648). The observed increases in coronary pressure gradient, stenosis resistance, and flow velocity did not reach statistical significance; however, the diastolic velocity–pressure gradient relation was consistent with a significant increase in relative stenosis severity (k coefficient, <i>P</i><0.0001), in keeping with exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments and dilatation of normal segments, with trends toward reversal with nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The catheterization laboratory protocol provides a model to study myocardial ischemia and the actions of novel and established antianginal drugs. Administration of nitroglycerin causes changes in the systemic and coronary circulation that combine to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and to increase supply, thereby attenuating exercise-induced ischemia. Designing antianginal therapies that exploit these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec>

Efficacy and Safety of a Pharmaco-Invasive Strategy With Half-Dose Alteplase Versus Primary Angioplasty in ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) cannot be offered to all patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Pharmaco-invasive (PhI) strategy has been proposed as a valuable alternative for eligible patients with STEMI. We conducted a randomized study to compare the efficacy and safety of a PhI strategy with half-dose fibrinolytic regimen versus PPCI in patients with STEMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The EARLY-MYO trial (Early Routine Catheterization After Alteplase Fibrinolysis Versus Primary PCI in Acute ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction) was an investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial comparing a PhI strategy with half-dose alteplase versus PPCI in patients with STEMI 18 to 75 years of age presenting ≤6 hours after symptom onset but with an expected PCI-related delay. The primary end point of the study was complete epicardial and myocardial reperfusion after PCI, defined as thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 3, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction myocardial perfusion grade 3, and ST-segment resolution ≥70%. We also measured infarct size and left ventricular ejection fraction with cardiac magnetic resonance and recorded 30-day clinical and safety outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 344 patients from 7 centers were randomized to PhI (n=171) or PPCI (n=173). PhI was noninferior (and even superior) to PPCI for the primary end point (34.2% versus 22.8%, <i>P</i> <sub>noninferiority</sub><0.05, <i>P</i><sub>superiority</sub>=0.022), with no significant differences in the frequency of the individual components of the combined end point: thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow 3 (91.3% versus 89.2%, <i>P</i>=0.580), thrombolysis in myocardial infarction myocardial perfusion grade 3 (65.8% versus 62.9%, <i>P</i>=0.730), and ST-segment resolution ≥70% (50.9% versus 45.5%, <i>P</i>=0.377). Infarct size (23.3%±11.3% versus 25.8%±13.7%, <i>P</i>=0.101) and left ventricular ejection fraction (52.2%±11.0% versus 51.4%±12.0%, <i>P</i>=0.562) were similar in both groups. No significant differences occurred in 30-day rates of total death (0.6% versus 1.2%, <i>P</i>=1.0), reinfarction (0.6% versus 0.6%, <i>P</i>=1.0), heart failure (13.5% versus 16.2%, <i>P</i>=0.545), major bleeding events (0.6% versus 0%, <i>P</i>=0.497), or intracranial hemorrhage (0% versus 0%), but <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> bleeding (26.9% versus 11.0%, <i>P</i><0.001) was observed more often in the PhI group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>For patients with STEMI presenting ≤6 hours after symptom onset and with an expected PCI-related delay, a PhI strategy with half-dose alteplase and timely PCI offers more complete epicardial and myocardial reperfusion when compared with PPCI. Adequately powered trials with this reperfusion strategy to assess clinical and safety outcomes are warranted.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Multicellular Transcriptional Analysis of Mammalian Heart Regeneration
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The inability of the adult mammalian heart to regenerate following injury represents a major barrier in cardiovascular medicine. In contrast, the neonatal mammalian heart retains a transient capacity for regeneration, which is lost shortly after birth. Defining the molecular mechanisms that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">govern</span></strong> regenerative capacity in the neonatal period remains a central goal in cardiac biology. Here, we assemble a transcriptomic framework of multiple cardiac cell populations during postnatal development and following injury, which enables comparative analyses of the regenerative (neonatal) versus nonregenerative (adult) state for the first time.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, leukocytes, and endothelial cells from infarcted and noninfarcted neonatal (P1) and adult (P56) mouse hearts were isolated by enzymatic dissociation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting at day 3 following surgery. RNA sequencing was performed on these cell populations to generate the transcriptome of the major cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. To complement our transcriptomic data, we also surveyed the epigenetic landscape of cardiomyocytes during postnatal maturation by performing deep sequencing of accessible chromatin regions by using the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin from purified mouse cardiomyocyte nuclei (P1, P14, and P56).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Profiling of cardiomyocyte and nonmyocyte transcriptional programs uncovered several injury-responsive genes across regenerative and nonregenerative time points. However, the majority of transcriptional changes in all cardiac cell types resulted from developmental maturation from neonatal stages to adulthood rather than activation of a distinct regeneration-specific gene program. Furthermore, adult leukocytes and fibroblasts were characterized by the expression of a proliferative gene expression network following infarction, which mirrored the neonatal state. In contrast, cardiomyocytes failed to reactivate the neonatal proliferative network following infarction, which was associated with loss of chromatin accessibility around cell cycle genes during postnatal maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This work provides a comprehensive framework and transcriptional resource of multiple cardiac cell populations during cardiac development, repair, and regeneration. Our findings define a regulatory program underpinning the neonatal regenerative state and identify alterations in the chromatin landscape that could limit reinduction of the regenerative program in adult cardiomyocytes.</p></sec>

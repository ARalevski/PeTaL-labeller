Interactions Between the Nucleus Accumbens and Auditory Cortices Predict Music Reward Value
<sec><title><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">music</span></strong> Was My First Love</title><p>Why do human beings enjoy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">music</span></strong>? <bold>Salimpoor <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 216) combined behavioral economics with brain scanning to explore how a piece of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">music</span></strong> is considered rewarding to an individual when it is heard for the first time. They discovered that neural activity in the mesolimbic striatum during listening to a novel piece of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">music</span></strong> was the best predictor of the money listeners were willing to spend on buying the piece. These observations implicate sensory cortical areas in reward processing, which the authors attribute to the aesthetic nature of the judgment.</p></sec>

Auditory neural networks involved in attention modulation prefer biologically significant sounds and exhibit sexual dimorphism in anurans
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Investigation of auditory attention networks in the Emei <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">music</span></strong> frog (<i>Babina daunchina</i>) supports the idea that the frog brain allocates neural attention resources to attractive sounds and that such processing is sexually dimorphic.</p>

Quantum reference beacon–guided superresolution optical focusing in complex media
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al scattering is generally considered to be a nuisance of microscopy that limits imaging depth and spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion. Wavefront shaping techniques enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al imaging at unprecedented depth, but attaining super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion within complex media remains a challenge. We used a quantum reference beacon (QRB), consisting of solid-state quantum emitters with spin-dependent fluorescence, to provide subwavelength guidestar feedback for wavefront shaping to achieve a super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>. We implemented the QRB-guided imaging with nitrogen-vacancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>s in diamond nanocrystals, which enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ing with a subdiffraction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion below 186 nanometers (less than half the wavelength). QRB-assisted wavefront-shaping should find use in a range of applications, including deep-tissue quantum enhanced sensing and individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al excitation of magnetically coupled spin ensembles for applications in quantum information processing.</p>

MerTK signaling in macrophages promotes the synthesis of inflammation resolution mediators by suppressing CaMKII activity
<p>Inflammation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion counterbalances excessive inflammation and restores tissue homeostasis after injury. Failure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion is mediated by endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), which are derived from long-chain fatty acids by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. 5-LOX plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of two classes of SPMs: lipoxins and resolvins. Cytoplasmic localization of the nonphosphorylated form of 5-LOX is essential for SPM biosynthesis, whereas nuclear localization of phosphorylated 5-LOX promotes proinflammatory leukotriene production. We previously showed that MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor on macrophages, promotes SPM biosynthesis by increasing the abundance of nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic 5-LOX. We now show that activation of MerTK in human macrophages led to ERK-mediated expression of the gene encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which decreased the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and suppressed the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This, in turn, reduced the activities of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and the kinase MK2, resulting in the increased abundance of the nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic form of 5-LOX and enhanced SPM biosynthesis. In a zymosan-induced peritonitis model, an inflammatory setting in which macrophage MerTK activation promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, inhibition of ERK activation delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, which was characterized by an increased number of neutrophils and decreased amounts of SPMs in tissue exudates. These findings contribute to our understanding of how MerTK signaling induces 5-LOX–derived SPM biosynthesis and suggest a therapeutic strategy to boost inflammation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion in settings where defective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion promotes disease progression.</p>

Structure of a symmetric photosynthetic reaction center–photosystem
<p>Reaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>s are pigment-protein complexes that drive photosynthesis by converting light into chemical energy. It is believed that they arose once from a homodimeric protein. The symmetry of a homodimer is broken in heterodimeric reaction-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong> structures, such as those reported previously.

An integrated diamond nanophotonics platform for quantum-optical networks
<p>Efficient interfaces between photons and quantum emitters form the basis for quantum networks and enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al nonlinearities at the single-photon level. We demonstrate an integrated platform for scalable quantum nanophotonics based on silicon-vacancy (SiV) color <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>s coupled to diamond nanodevices. By placing SiV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>s inside diamond photonic crystal cavities, we realize a quantum-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al switch controlled by a single color <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>. We control the switch using SiV metastable states and observe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al switching at the single-photon level. Raman transitions are used to realize a single-photon source with a tunable frequency and bandwidth in a diamond waveguide. By measuring intensity correlations of indistinguishable Raman photons emitted into a single waveguide, we observe a quantum interference effect resulting from the superradiant emission of two entangled SiV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>s.</p>

Allele-specific epigenome maps reveal sequence-dependent stochastic switching at regulatory loci
<p>To assess the impact of genetic variation in regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> on human health, we constructed a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion map of allelic imbalances in DNA methylation, histone marks, and gene transcription in 71 epigenomes from 36 distinct cell and tissue types from 13 donors. Deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 49 methylomes revealed sequence-dependent CpG methylation imbalances at thousands of heterozygous regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong>. Such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> are enriched for stochastic switching, which is defined as random transitions between fully methylated and unmethylated states of DNA. The methylation imbalances at thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> are explainable by different relative frequencies of the methylated and unmethylated states for the two alleles. Further analyses provided a unifying model that links sequence-dependent allelic imbalances of the epigenome, stochastic switching at gene regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong>, and disease-associated genetic variation.</p>

3D nanofabrication by volumetric deposition and controlled shrinkage of patterned scaffolds
<p>Lithographic nanofabrication is often limited to successive fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) layers. We present a strategy for the direct assembly of 3D nanomaterials consisting of metals, semiconductors, and biomolecules arranged in virtually any 3D geometry. We used hydrogels as scaffolds for volumetric deposition of materials at defined points in space. We then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>ally patterned these scaffolds in three dimensions, attached one or more functional materials, and then shrank and dehydrated them in a controlled way to achieve nanoscale feature sizes in a solid substrate. We demonstrate that our process, Implosion Fabrication (ImpFab), can directly write highly conductive, 3D silver nanostructures within an acrylic scaffold via volumetric silver deposition. Using ImpFab, we achieve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ions in the tens of nanometers and complex, non–self-supporting 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>es of interest for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al metamaterials.</p>

Photon-mediated interactions between quantum emitters in a diamond nanocavity
<p>Photon-mediated interactions between quantum systems are essential for realizing quantum networks and scalable quantum information processing. We demonstrate such interactions between pairs of silicon-vacancy (SiV) color <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>s coupled to a diamond nanophotonic cavity. When the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al transitions of the two color <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>s are tuned into resonance, the coupling to the common cavity mode results in a coherent interaction between them, leading to spectrally resolved superradiant and subradiant states. We use the electronic spin degrees of freedom of the SiV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>s to control these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>ally mediated interactions. Such controlled interactions will be crucial in developing cavity-mediated quantum gates between spin qubits and for realizing scalable quantum network nodes.</p>

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a programmed walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their locomotion during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual motion pattern (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the programmed walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of programmed behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong> flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

Nonreciprocal lasing in topological cavities of arbitrary geometries

Nonreciprocity originates from unidirectional edge states at the boundary between photonic structures with distinct topological invariants.

Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Resolves Molecular Relationships Among Individual Plant Cells
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been used extensively to study cell-specific gene expression in animals, but it has not been widely applied to plants. Here, we describe the use of a commercially available droplet-based microfluidics platform for high-throughput scRNA-seq to obtain single-cell transcriptomes from protoplasts of more than 10,000 Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root cells. We find that all major tissues and developmental stages are represented in this single-cell transcriptome population. Further, distinct subpopulations and rare cell types, including putative quiescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong> cells, were identified. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed analysis of root epidermal cell transcriptomes defined developmental trajectories for individual cells progressing from meristematic through mature stages of root-hair and nonhair cell differentiation. In addition, single-cell transcriptomes were obtained from root epidermis mutants, enabling a comparative analysis of gene expression at single-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion and providing an unprecedented view of the impact of the mutated genes. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of scRNA-seq in plants and provides a first-generation gene expression map of the Arabidopsis root at single-cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion.</p>

Identification of Genes Related to Cold Tolerance and a Functional Allele That Confers Cold Tolerance
<p>Cold stress is a major factor limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide, especially at the seedling and booting stages. The identification of genes associated with cold tolerance (CT) in rice is important for sustainable food production. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide association study to identify the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> associated with CT by using a 1,033-accession diversity panel. We identified five CT-related genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> at the booting stage. Accessions carrying multiple cold-tolerant alleles displayed a higher seed-setting rate than did accessions that had no cold-tolerant alleles or carried a single allele. At the seedling stage, eight genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> related to CT have been identified. Among these, <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> was identified as the candidate gene for the <i>qPSR10</i> genetic locus that is associated with CT in rice seedlings. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SNP2<sup>G</sup>, at position 343 in <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> is responsible for conferring CT at the seedling stage in rice. Further analysis of the haplotype network revealed that SNP2<sup>G</sup> was present in 80.08% of the temperate <i>japonica</i> accessions but only 3.8% of the <i>indica</i> ones. We used marker-assisted selection to construct a series of BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>3</sub> near-isogenic lines possessing the cold-tolerant allele SNP2<sup>G</sup>. When subjected to cold stress, plants carrying SNP2<sup>G</sup> survived better as seedlings and showed higher grain weight than plants carrying the SNP2<sup>A</sup> allele. The CT-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> identified here and the functional verification of <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> will provide genetic resources for breeding cold-tolerant varieties and for studying the molecular basis of CT in rice.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> or closely linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong>. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity.

Integrated Consensus Map of Cultivated Peanut and Wild Relatives Reveals Structures of the A and B Genomes of <i>Arachis</i> and Divergence of the Legume Genomes
<p>The complex, tetraploid genome structure of peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) has obstructed advances in genetics and genomics in the species. The aim of this study is to understand the genome structure of <i>Arachis</i> by developing a high-density integrated consensus map. Three recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses between the A genome diploid species, <i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis stenosperma</i>; the B genome diploid species, <i>Arachis ipaënsis</i> and <i>Arachis magna</i>; and between the AB genome tetraploids, <i>A. hypogaea</i> and an artificial amphidiploid (<i>A. ipaënsis</i> × <i>A. duranensis</i>)<sup>4×</sup>, were used to construct genetic linkage maps: 10 linkage groups (LGs) of 544 cM with 597 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> for the A genome; 10 LGs of 461 cM with 798 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> for the B genome; and 20 LGs of 1442 cM with 1469 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> for the AB genome. The resultant maps plus 13 published maps were integrated into a consensus map covering 2651 cM with 3693 marker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> which was anchored to 20 consensus LGs corresponding to the A and B genomes. The comparative genomics with genome sequences of <i>Cajanus cajan</i>, <i>Glycine max</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and <i>Medicago truncatula</i> revealed that the <i>Arachis</i> genome has segmented synteny relationship to the other legumes. The comparative maps in legumes, integrated tetraploid consensus maps, and genome-specific diploid maps will increase the genetic and genomic understanding of <i>Arachis</i> and should facilitate molecular breeding.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Absence of strong strain effects in behavioral analyses of <i>Shank3</i>-deficient mice
<p>Haploinsufficiency of <i>SHANK3</i>, caused by chromosomal abnormalities or mutations that disrupt one copy of the gene, leads to a neurodevelopmental syndrome called Phelan-McDermid syndrome, symptoms of which can include absent or delayed speech, intellectual disability, neurological changes and autism spectrum disorders. The SHANK3 protein forms a key structural part of the post-synaptic density. We previously generated and characterized mice with a targeted disruption of <i>Shank3</i> in which exons coding for the ankyrin-repeat domain were deleted and expression of full-length Shank3 was disrupted. We documented specific deficits in synaptic function and plasticity, along with reduced reciprocal social interactions, in <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous mice. Changes in phenotype owing to a mutation at a single locus are quite frequently modulated by other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong>, most dramatically when the entire genetic background is changed. In mice, each strain of laboratory mouse represents a distinct genetic background and alterations in phenotype owing to gene knockout or transgenesis are frequently different across strains, which can lead to the identification of important modifier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong>. We have investigated the effect of genetic background on phenotypes of <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous, knockout and wild-type mice, using C57BL/6, 129SVE and FVB/Ntac strain backgrounds. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed on observable behaviors with the goal of carrying out subsequent analyses to identify modifier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong>. Surprisingly, there were very modest strain effects over a large battery of analyses. These results indicate that behavioral phenotypes associated with <i>Shank3</i> haploinsufficiency are largely strain-independent.</p>

PI(4,5)P2 regulates myoblast fusion through Arp2/3 regulator localization at the fusion site
<p>Cell-cell fusion is a regulated process that requires merging of the opposing membranes and underlying cytoskeletons. However, the integration between membrane and cytoskeleton signaling during fusion is not known. Using <i>Drosophila</i>, we demonstrate that the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 is a crucial regulator of F-actin dynamics during myoblast fusion. PI(4,5)P2 is locally enriched and colocalizes spatially and temporally with the F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> that defines the fusion site. PI(4,5)P2 enrichment depends on receptor engagement but is upstream or parallel to actin remodeling. Regulators of actin branching via Arp2/3 colocalize with PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vivo</i> and bind PI(4,5)P2 <i>in vitro</i>. Manipulation of PI(4,5)P2 availability leads to impaired fusion, with a reduction in the F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> size and altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> morphology. Mechanistically, the changes in the actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong> are due to a failure in the enrichment of actin regulators at the fusion site. Moreover, improper localization of these regulators hinders expansion of the fusion interface. Thus, PI(4,5)P2 enrichment at the fusion site encodes spatial and temporal information that regulates fusion progression through the localization of activators of actin polymerization.</p>

Interhospital Transfer Before Thrombectomy Is Associated With Delayed Treatment and Worse Outcome in the STRATIS Registry (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Endovascular treatment with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is beneficial for patients with acute stroke suffering a large-vessel occlusion, although treatment efficacy is highly time-dependent. We hypothesized that interhospital transfer to endovascular-capable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>s would result in treatment delays and worse clinical outcomes compared with direct presentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>STRATIS (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke) was a prospective, multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>, observational, single-arm study of real-world MT for acute stroke because of anterior-circulation large-vessel occlusion performed at 55 sites over 2 years, including 1000 patients with severe stroke and treated within 8 hours. Patients underwent MT with or without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and were admitted to endovascular-capable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>s via either interhospital transfer or direct presentation. The primary clinical outcome was functional independence (modified Rankin Score 0–2) at 90 days. We assessed (1) real-world time metrics of stroke care delivery, (2) outcome differences between direct and transfer patients undergoing MT, and (3) the potential impact of local hospital bypass.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 984 patients were analyzed. Median onset-to-revascularization time was 202.0 minutes for direct versus 311.5 minutes for transfer patients (<i>P</i><0.001). Clinical outcomes were better in the direct group, with 60.0% (299/498) achieving functional independence compared with 52.2% (213/408) in the transfer group (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.79; <i>P</i>=0.02). Likewise, excellent outcome (modified Rankin Score 0–1) was achieved in 47.4% (236/498) of direct patients versus 38.0% (155/408) of transfer patients (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.92; <i>P</i>=0.005). Mortality did not differ between the 2 groups (15.1% for direct, 13.7% for transfer; <i>P</i>=0.55). Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator did not impact outcomes. Hypothetical bypass modeling for all transferred patients suggested that intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 12 minutes, but MT would be performed 91 minutes sooner if patients were routed directly to endovascular-capable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>s. If bypass is limited to a 20-mile radius from onset, then intravenous tissue plasminogen activator would be delayed by 7 minutes and MT performed 94 minutes earlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this large, real-world study, interhospital transfer was associated with significant treatment delays and lower chance of good outcome. Strategies to facilitate more rapid identification of large-vessel occlusion and direct routing to endovascular-capable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>s for patients with severe stroke may improve outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect

We report on photonic spin-symmetry breaking and unexpected spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>c phase structure. Weak disorder induces a photonic spin Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong disorder leads to spin-split modes in momentum space, a random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al Rashba effect. Study of the momentum space entropy reveals an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al transition upon reaching a critical point where the structure’s anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular topology into the disordered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the disorder strength.

Purcell effect for active tuning of light scattering from semiconductor optical antennas
<p>Subwavelength, high–refractive index semiconductor nanostructures support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al resonances that endow them with valuable antenna functions. Control over the intrinsic properties, including their complex refractive index, size, and geometry, has been used to manipulate fundamental light absorption, scattering, and emission processes in nanostructured optoelectronic devices. In this study, we harness the electric and magnetic resonances of such antennas to achieve a very strong dependence of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al properties on the external environment. Specifically, we illustrate how the resonant scattering wavelength of single silicon nanowires is tunable across the entire visible spectrum by simply moving the height of the nanowires above a metallic mirror.

Arbitrary spin-to–orbital angular momentum conversion of light
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al elements that convert the spin angular momentum (SAM) of light into vortex beams have found applications in classical and quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>s. These elements—SAM-to–orbital angular momentum (OAM) converters—are based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">geometri</span></strong>c phase and only permit the conversion of left- and right-circular polarizations (spin states) into states with opposite OAM. We present a method for converting arbitrary SAM states into total angular momentum states characterized by a superposition of independent OAM. We designed a metasurface that converts left- and right-circular polarizations into states with independent values of OAM and designed another device that performs this operation for elliptically polarized states. These results illustrate a general material-mediated connection between SAM and OAM of light and may find applications in producing complex structured light and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al communication.</p>

Observation of mean path length invariance in light-scattering media
<p>The microstructure of a medium strongly influences how light propagates through it. The amount of disorder it contains determines whether the medium is transparent or opaque. Theory predicts that exciting such a medium homogeneously and isotropically makes some of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al properties depend only on the medium’s outer geometry. Here, we report an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al experiment demonstrating that the mean path length of light is invariant with respect to the microstructure of the medium it scatters through. Using colloidal solutions with varying concentration and particle size, the invariance of the mean path length is observed over nearly two orders of magnitude in scattering strength. Our results can be extended to a wide range of systems—however ordered, correlated, or disordered—and apply to all wave-scattering problems.</p>

Chaos-assisted broadband momentum transformation in optical microresonators
<p>The law of momentum conservation rules out many desired processes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al microresonators.

Assisted by chaotic motions, broadband light can travel between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al modes with different angular momenta within a few picoseconds. Efficient coupling from visible to near-infrared bands is demonstrated between a nanowaveguide and whispering gallery modes with quality factors exceeding 10 million. The broadband momentum transformation enhances the device conversion efficiency of the third-harmonic generation by greater than three orders of magnitude over the conventional evanescent-wave coupling. The observed broadband and fast momentum transformation could promote applications such as multicolor lasers, broadband memories, and multiwavelength <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al networks.</p>

Revealing the subfemtosecond dynamics of orbital angular momentum in nanoplasmonic vortices

The response of a large body can be tuned with a single impurity, including cases such as engineering perfect magnetic conductor and epsilon-and-mu-near-zero media with nonmagnetic constituents.

Quantum optical circulator controlled by a single chirally coupled atom
<p>Integrated nonreciprocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al components, which have an inherent asymmetry between their forward and backward propagation direction, are key for routing signals in photonic circuits. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-integrated quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al circulator operated by a single atom. Its nonreciprocal behavior arises from the chiral interaction between the atom and the transversally confined light. We demonstrate that the internal quantum state of the atom controls the operation direction of the circulator and that it features a strongly nonlinear response at the single-photon level. This enables, for example, photon number–dependent routing and novel quantum simulation protocols. Furthermore, such a circulator can in principle be prepared in a coherent superposition of its operational states and may become a key element for quantum information processing in scalable integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al circuits.</p>

Single-molecule optomechanics in “picocavities”
<p>Trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffraction limit and can confine light to volumes typically on the order of 30 cubic nanometers.

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene

Scanning probe and transmission electron microscopies reveal the reality, however, where the material resembles a patchwork quilt with polycrystals of different orientation and size separated by grain boundaries forming a mosaic. These structures play an influential role in determining the transport and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al properties of the membrane. <bold>Yin <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 488; see the Perspective by <bold>Neshev and Kivshar</bold>) demonstrate a simple microscopy technique based on the nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al response of the materials to probe and characterize atomically thin layers of MoS<sub>2</sub>. The technique should prove useful during the characterization and optimization of atomically thin membranes.</p></sec>

The Long Intergenic Noncoding RNA (LincRNA) Landscape of the Soybean Genome
<p>Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as important regulators of diverse biological processes. However, our understanding of lincRNA abundance and function remains very limited especially for agriculturally important plants. Soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a major legume crop plant providing over a half of global oilseed production. Moreover, soybean can form symbiotic relationships with <i>Rhizobium</i> bacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Soybean has a complex paleopolyploid genome and exhibits many vegetative and floral development complexities. Soybean cultivars have photoperiod requirements restricting its use and productivity. Molecular regulators of these legume-specific developmental processes remain enigmatic. Long noncoding RNAs may play important regulatory roles in soybean growth and development. In this study, over one billion RNA-seq read pairs from 37 samples representing nine tissues were used to discover 6,018 lincRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong>. The lincRNAs were shorter than protein-coding transcripts and had lower expression levels and more sample specific expression. Few of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> were found to be conserved in two other legume species (chickpea [<i>Cicer arietinum</i>] and <i>Medicago truncatula</i>), but almost 200 homeologous lincRNAs in the soybean genome were detected. Protein-coding gene-lincRNA coexpression analysis suggested an involvement of lincRNAs in stress response, signal transduction, and developmental processes. Positional analysis of lincRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> implicated involvement in transcriptional regulation. lincRNA expression from centromeric regions was observed especially in actively dividing tissues, suggesting possible roles in cell division. Integration of publicly available genome-wide association data with the lincRNA map of the soybean genome uncovered 23 lincRNAs potentially associated with agronomic traits.</p>

Cytokinin-Auxin Crosstalk in the Gynoecial Primordium Ensures Correct Domain Patterning<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) gynoecium consists of two congenitally fused carpels made up of two lateral valve domains and two medial domains, which retain meristematic properties and later fuse to produce the female reproductive structures vital for fertilization. Polar auxin transport (PAT) is important for setting up distinct apical auxin signaling domains in the early floral meristem remnants allowing for lateral domain identity and outgrowth. Crosstalk between auxin and cytokinin plays an important role in the development of other meristematic tissues, but hormone interaction studies to date have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed on more accessible later-stage gynoecia and the spatiotemporal interactions pivotal for patterning of early gynoecium primordia remain unknown. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ing on the earliest stages, we propose a cytokinin-auxin feedback model during early gynoecium patterning and hormone homeostasis. Our results suggest that cytokinin positively regulates auxin signaling in the incipient gynoecial primordium and strengthen the concept that cytokinin regulates auxin homeostasis during gynoecium development. Specifically, medial cytokinin promotes auxin biosynthesis components [<i>YUCCA1</i>/<i>4</i> (<i>YUC1</i>/<i>4</i>)] in, and PINFORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated auxin efflux from, the medial domain. The resulting laterally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">focus</span></strong>ed auxin signaling triggers <i>ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE PHOSPHOTRANSFER PROTEIN6</i> (<i>AHP6</i>), which then represses cytokinin signaling in a PAT-dependent feedback. Cytokinin also down-regulates PIN3, promoting auxin accumulation in the apex. The <i>yuc1</i>, <i>yuc4</i>, and <i>ahp6</i> mutants are hypersensitive to exogenous cytokinin and 1-napthylphthalamic acid (NPA), highlighting their role in mediolateral gynoecium patterning. In summary, these mechanisms self-regulate cytokinin and auxin signaling domains, ensuring correct domain specification and gynoecium development.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of oxidized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid oxidation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Novel Stress-Inducible Antisense RNAs of Protein-Coding Loci Are Synthesized by RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase
<p>Our previous study identified approximately 6,000 abiotic stress-responsive noncoding transcripts existing on the antisense strand of protein-coding genes and implied that a type of antisense RNA was synthesized from a sense RNA template by <i>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</i> (<i>RDR</i>). Expression analyses revealed that the expression of novel abiotic stress-induced antisense RNA on 1,136 gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> was reduced in the <i>rdr1/2/6</i> mutants. RNase protection indicated that the <i>RD29A</i> antisense RNA and other RDR1/2/6-dependent antisense RNAs are involved in the formation of dsRNA. The accumulation of stress-inducible antisense RNA was decreased and increased in <i>dcp5</i> and <i>xrn4</i>, respectively, but not changed in <i>dcl2/3/4</i>, <i>nrpd1a</i> and <i>nrpd1b</i>. RNA-seq analyses revealed that the majority of the RDR1/2/6-dependent antisense RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> did not overlap with RDR1/2/6-dependent 20–30 nt RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong>. Additionally, <i>rdr1/2/6</i> mutants decreased the degradation rate of the sense RNA and exhibited arrested root growth during the recovery stage following a drought stress, whereas <i>dcl2/3/4</i> mutants did not. Collectively, these results indicate that RDRs have stress-inducible antisense RNA synthesis activity and a novel biological function that is different from the known endogenous small RNA pathways from protein-coding genes. These data reveal a novel mechanism of RNA regulation during abiotic stress response that involves complex RNA degradation pathways.</p>

Vesicle Dynamics during Plant Cell Cytokinesis Reveals Distinct Developmental Phases
<p>Cell division in plant cells requires the deposition of a new cell wall between the two daughter cells. The assembly of this plate requires the coordinated movement of cargo vesicles whose size is below the diffraction-limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optic</span></strong>al microscope. We combined high spatial and temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion confocal laser scanning microscopy with advanced image-processing tools and fluorescence fluctuation methods and distinguished three distinct phases during cell plate expansion in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) ‘Bright Yellow-2’ cells: massive delivery of preexisting vesicles to a disk-shaped region at the equatorial plane precedes a primary rapid expansion phase followed by a secondary, slow expansion phase during which the extremity of the circular plate seeks contact with the mother wall and brings about the separation of the two portions of cytoplasm. Different effects of pharmacological inhibition emphasize the distinct nature of the assembly and expansion mechanisms characterizing these phases.</p>

Natural Variation in <i>Brachypodium</i> Links Vernalization and Flowering Time Loci as Major Flowering Determinants
<p>The domestication of plants is underscored by the selection of agriculturally favorable developmental traits, including flowering time, which resulted in the creation of varieties with altered growth habits. Research into the pathways underlying these growth habits in cereals has highlighted the role of three main flowering regulators: <i>VERNALIZATION1</i> (<i>VRN1</i>), <i>VRN2</i>, and <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> (<i>FT</i>). Previous reverse genetic studies suggested that the roles of <i>VRN1</i> and <i>FT</i> are conserved in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> yet identified considerable ambiguity surrounding the role of <i>VRN2</i>. To investigate the natural diversity governing flowering time pathways in a nondomesticated grass, the reference <i>B. distachyon</i> accession Bd21 was crossed with the vernalization-dependent accession ABR6. Resequencing of ABR6 allowed the creation of a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based genetic map at the F4 stage of the mapping population. Flowering time was evaluated in F4:5 families in five environmental conditions, and three major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> were found to govern flowering time. Interestingly, two of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> colocalize with the <i>B. distachyon</i> homologs of the major flowering pathway genes <i>VRN2</i> and <i>FT</i>, whereas no linkage was observed at <i>VRN1</i>. Characterization of these candidates identified sequence and expression variation between the two parental genotypes, which may explain the contrasting growth habits. However, the identification of additional quantitative trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> suggests that greater complexity underlies flowering time in this nondomesticated system. Studying the interaction of these regulators in <i>B. distachyon</i> provides insights into the evolutionary context of flowering time regulation in the Poaceae as well as elucidates the way humans have utilized the natural variation present in grasses to create modern temperate cereals.</p>

Crohn's Disease Loci Are Common Targets of Protozoa-Driven Selection
<p>Previous studies indicated that a few risk variants for autoimmune diseases are subject to pathogen-driven selection. Nonetheless, the proportion of risk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong> that has been targeted by pathogens and the type of infectious agent(s) that exerted the strongest pressure remain to be evaluated. We assessed whether different pathogens exerted a pressure on known Crohn's disease (CD) risk variants and demonstrate that these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are preferential targets of protozoa-driven selection (<i>P</i> = 0.008). In particular, 19% of SNPs associated with CD have been subject to protozoa-driven selective pressure. Analysis of <i>P</i> values from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and meta-analyses indicated that protozoan-selected SNPs display significantly stronger association with CD compared with nonselected variants. This same behavior was not observed for GWASs of other autoimmune diseases. Thus, we integrated selection signatures and meta-analysis results to prioritize five genic SNPs for replication in an Italian cohort. Three SNPs were significantly associated with CD risk, and combination with meta-analysis results yielded <i>P</i> values < 4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. The bona fide risk alleles are located in <i>ARHGEF2</i>, an interactor of <i>NOD2, NSF</i>, a gene involved in autophagy, and <i>HEBP1</i>, encoding a possible mediator of inflammation. Pathway analysis indicated that <i>ARHGEF2</i> and <i>NSF</i> participate in a molecular network, which also contains <i>VAMP3</i> (previously associated to CD) and is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">center</span></strong>ed around miR-31 (known to be disregulated in CD). Thus, we show that protozoa-driven selective pressure had a major role in shaping predisposition to CD. We next used this information for the identification of three bona fide novel susceptibility <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">loci</span></strong>.</p>

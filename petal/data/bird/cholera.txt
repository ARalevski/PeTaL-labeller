A secreted bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolase enhances tolerance to enteric pathogens
<p>The intestinal microbiome modulates host susceptibility to enteric pathogens, but the specific protective factors and mechanisms of individual bacterial species are not fully characterized. We show that secreted antigen A (SagA) from <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> is sufficient to protect <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> against <i>Salmonella</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s by promoting pathogen tolerance. The NlpC/p60 peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of SagA is required and generates muramyl-peptide fragments that are sufficient to protect <i>C. elegans</i> against <i>Salmonella</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s in a <i>tol-1</i>–dependent manner. SagA can also be heterologously expressed and secreted to improve the protective activity of probiotics against <i>Salmonella</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s in <i>C. elegans</i> and mice. Our study highlights how protective intestinal bacteria can modify microbial-associated molecular patterns to enhance pathogen tolerance.</p>

Integrated in vivo multiomics analysis identifies p21-activated kinase signaling as a driver of colitis
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that has limited treatment options. To gain insight into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of chronic colonic inflammation (colitis), we performed a multiomics analysis that integrated RNA microarray, total protein mass spectrometry (MS), and phosphoprotein MS measurements from a mouse model of the disease. Because we collected all three types of data from individual samples, we tracked information flow from RNA to protein to phosphoprotein and identified signaling molecules that were coordinately or discordantly regulated and pathways that had complex regulation in vivo. For example, the genes encoding acute-phase proteins were expressed in the liver, but the proteins were detected by MS in the colon during inflammation. We also ascertained the types of data that best described particular facets of chronic inflammation. Using gene set enrichment analysis and trans-omics coexpression network analysis, we found that each data set provided a distinct viewpoint on the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of colitis. Combining human transcriptomic data with the mouse multiomics data implicated increased p21-activated kinase (Pak) signaling as a driver of colitis. Chemical inhibition of Pak1 and Pak2 with FRAX597 suppressed active colitis in mice. These studies provide translational insights into the mechanisms contributing to colitis and identify Pak as a potential therapeutic target in IBD.</p>

TCR-stimulated changes in cell surface CD46 expression generate type 1 regulatory T cells
<p>A lack of regulatory T cell function is a critical factor in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Ligation of the complement regulatory protein CD46 facilitates the differentiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) effector cells into interleukin-10 (IL-10)–secreting type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells), and this pathway is defective in MS patients. Cleavage of the ectodomain of CD46, which contains three N-glycosylation sites and multiple O-glycosylation sites, enables CD46 to activate T cells. We found that stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR)–CD3 complex was associated with a reduction in the apparent molecular mass of CD46 in a manner that depended on O-glycosylation. CD3-stimulated changes in CD46 O-glycosylation status reduced CD46 processing and subsequent T cell signaling. During T cell activation, CD46 was recruited to the immune synapse in a manner that required its serine-, threonine-, and proline-rich (STP) region, which is rich in O-glycosylation sites. Recruitment of CD46 to the immune synapse switched T cells from producing the inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to producing IL-10. Furthermore, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from MS patients did not exhibit a CD3-stimulated reduction in the mass of CD46 and thus showed increased amounts of cell surface CD46. Together, these data suggest a possible mechanism underlying the regulatory function of CD46 on T cells. Our findings may explain why this pathway is defective in patients with MS and provide insights into MS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s that could help to design future immunotherapies.</p>

TALK-1 channels control β cell endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) serves critical roles in controlling pancreatic β cell function and becomes perturbed during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of diabetes. ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is determined by ion movements across the ER membrane, including K<sup>+</sup> flux through K<sup>+</sup> channels. We demonstrated that K<sup>+</sup> flux through ER-localized TALK-1 channels facilitated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER in mouse and human β cells. We found that β cells from mice lacking TALK-1 exhibited reduced basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and increased ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, suggesting reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak. These changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis were presumably due to TALK-1–mediated ER K<sup>+</sup> flux, because we recorded K<sup>+</sup> currents mediated by functional TALK-1 channels on the nuclear membrane, which is continuous with the ER. Moreover, overexpression of K<sup>+</sup>-impermeable TALK-1 channels in HEK293 cells did not reduce ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. Reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in β cells is associated with ER stress and islet dysfunction in diabetes, and islets from TALK-1–deficient mice fed a high-fat diet showed reduced signs of ER stress, suggesting that TALK-1 activity exacerbated ER stress. Our data establish TALK-1 channels as key regulators of β cell ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> and suggest that TALK-1 may be a therapeutic target to reduce ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling defects in β cells during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of diabetes.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A novel mouse model of Warburg Micro syndrome reveals roles for RAB18 in eye development and organisation of the neuronal cytoskeleton
<p>Mutations in <i>RAB18</i> have been shown to cause the heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM). Individuals with WARBM present with a range of clinical symptoms, including ocular and neurological abnormalities. However, the underlying cellular and molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of the disorder remains unclear, largely owing to the lack of any robust animal models that phenocopy both the ocular and neurological features of the disease. We report here the generation and characterisation of a novel <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse model of WARBM. <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice are viable and fertile. They present with congenital nuclear cataracts and atonic pupils, recapitulating the characteristic ocular features that are associated with WARBM. Additionally, <i>Rab18</i>-mutant cells exhibit an increase in lipid droplet size following treatment with oleic acid. Lipid droplet abnormalities are a characteristic feature of cells taken from WARBM individuals, as well as cells taken from individuals with other neurodegenerative conditions. Neurological dysfunction is also apparent in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice, including progressive weakness of the hind limbs. We show that the neurological defects are, most likely, not caused by gross perturbations in synaptic vesicle recycling in the central or peripheral nervous system. Rather, loss of <i>Rab18</i> is associated with widespread disruption of the neuronal cytoskeleton, including abnormal accumulations of neurofilament and microtubule proteins in synaptic terminals, and gross disorganisation of the cytoskeleton in peripheral nerves. Global proteomic profiling of peripheral nerves in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice reveals significant alterations in several core molecular pathways that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in neurons. The apparent similarities between the WARBM phenotype and the phenotype that we describe here indicate that the <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse provides an important platform for investigation of the disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s and therapeutic interventions.</p>

Detailed echocardiographic studies have been performed in AL amyloidosis but not in TTR amyloidosis and might give insight into this difference. We assessed cardiac structure and function and outcome in a large population of patients with CA and compared findings in TTR and AL-related disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We analyzed 172 patients with CA (AL amyloidosis, n=80; ATTRm, n=36; ATTRwt, n=56) by standard echocardiography and 2-dimensional speckle-tracking imaging-derived left ventricular (LV) longitudinal (LS), radial, and circumferential strains. Despite a preserved LV ejection fraction (55±12%), LS was severely impaired in CA.

In vivo modeling of human neuron dynamics and Down syndrome

Longitudinal imaging of >4000 grafted developing human neurons revealed that neuronal arbors refined via branch-specific retraction; human synaptic networks substantially restructured over 4 months, with balanced rates of synapse formation and elimination; and oscillatory population activity mirrored the patterns of fetal neural networks. Lastly, we found increased synaptic stability and reduced oscillations in transplants from two individuals with Down syndrome, demonstrating the potential of in vivo imaging in human tissue grafts for patient-specific modeling of cortical development, physiology, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s.</p>

An autoimmune disease variant of IgG1 modulates B cell activation and differentiation
<p>The maintenance of autoreactive B cells in a quiescent state is crucial for preventing autoimmunity. Here we identify a variant of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) with a Gly<sup>396</sup>→Arg substitution (hIgG1-G396R), which positively correlates with systemic lupus erythematosus. In induced lupus models, murine homolog Gly<sup>390</sup>→Arg (G390R) knockin mice generate excessive numbers of plasma cells, leading to a burst of broad-spectrum autoantibodies. This enhanced production of antibodies is also observed in hapten-immunized G390R mice, as well as in influenza-vaccinated human G396R homozygous carriers. This variant potentiates the phosphorylation of the IgG1 immunoglobulin tail tyrosine (ITT) motif. This, in turn, alters the availability of phospho-ITT to trigger longer adaptor protein Grb2 dwell times in immunological synapses, leading to hyper–Grb2–Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) signaling upon antigen binding. Thus, the hIgG1-G396R variant is important for both lupus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s and antibody responses after vaccination.</p>

Poly(ADP-ribose) drives pathologic α-synuclein neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease
<p>The pathologic accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) underlies Parkinson’s disease (PD). The molecular mechanisms by which pathologic α-syn causes neurodegeneration in PD are not known. Here, we found that pathologic α-syn activates poly(adenosine 5′-diphosphate–ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), and PAR generation accelerates the formation of pathologic α-syn, resulting in cell death via parthanatos. PARP inhibitors or genetic deletion of PARP-1 prevented pathologic α-syn toxicity. In a feed-forward loop, PAR converted pathologic α-syn to a more toxic strain. PAR levels were increased in the cerebrospinal fluid and brains of patients with PD, suggesting that PARP activation plays a role in PD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s. Thus, strategies aimed at inhibiting PARP-1 activation could hold promise as a disease-modifying therapy to prevent the loss of dopamine neurons in PD.</p>

Structural basis for recognition of frizzled proteins by <i>Clostridium difficile</i> toxin B
<p><i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection is the most common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in developed countries. The major virulence factor, <i>C. difficile</i> toxin B (TcdB), targets colonic epithelia by binding to the frizzled (FZD) family of Wnt receptors, but how TcdB recognizes FZDs is unclear. Here, we present the crystal structure of a TcdB fragment in complex with the cysteine-rich domain of human FZD2 at 2.5-angstrom resolution, which reveals an endogenous FZD-bound fatty acid acting as a co-receptor for TcdB binding. This lipid occupies the binding site for Wnt-adducted palmitoleic acid in FZDs. TcdB binding locks the lipid in place, preventing Wnt from engaging FZDs and signaling. Our findings establish a central role of fatty acids in FZD-mediated TcdB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s and suggest strategies to modulate Wnt signaling.</p>

Antibody-dependent enhancement of severe dengue disease in humans
<p>For dengue viruses 1 to 4 (DENV1-4), a specific range of antibody titer has been shown to enhance viral replication in vitro and severe disease in animal models. Although suspected, such antibody-dependent enhancement of severe disease has not been shown to occur in humans. Using multiple statistical approaches to study a long-term pediatric cohort in Nicaragua, we show that risk of severe dengue disease is highest within a narrow range of preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers. By contrast, we observe protection from all symptomatic dengue disease at high antibody titers. Thus, immune correlates of severe dengue must be evaluated separately from correlates of protection against symptomatic disease. These results have implications for studies of dengue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s and for vaccine development, because enhancement, not just lack of protection, is of concern.</p>

These structures suggest a mechanism for the control of constitutive signaling, and their unusually high resolution enabled a structure-based campaign for new agonists of the D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor. The ability to efficiently exploit structure for specific probe discovery—rapidly moving from elucidating receptor structure to discovering previously unrecognized, selective agonists—testifies to the power of structure-based approaches.</p>

Dopamine oxidation mediates mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease
<p>Mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction have been implicated in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but how these pathways are linked in human neurons remains unclear. Here we studied dopaminergic neurons derived from patients with idiopathic and familial PD. We identified a time-dependent pathological cascade beginning with mitochondrial oxidant stress leading to oxidized dopamine accumulation and ultimately resulting in reduced glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity, lysosomal dysfunction, and α-synuclein accumulation. This toxic cascade was observed in human, but not in mouse, PD neurons at least in part because of species-specific differences in dopamine metabolism. Increasing dopamine synthesis or α-synuclein amounts in mouse midbrain neurons recapitulated pathological phenotypes observed in human neurons. Thus, dopamine oxidation represents an important link between mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in PD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s.</p>

Can immunotherapy treat neurodegeneration?
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating age-related neurodegenerative disorder and the most frequent cause of senile dementia. The appearance of cognitive decline in this disease is associated with synaptic and neuronal loss, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, the accumulation of intracellular and extracellular plaques of misfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, and local neuroinflammation. The major focus in AD therapeutics has been to directly target specific factors in the brain that are believed to be associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s—primarily Ab and tau proteins—by using immunological or pharmacological tools. However, in the clinic, these therapies have not shown efficacy in restoring cognitive function nor in arresting the disease course. In addition, treating brain inflammation, which often accompanies neurodegenerative diseases, with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has shown limited or no effect on disease progression (<i>1</i>). Collectively, these results have led investigators to revisit the identification of the factors participating in AD and in particular the role of the immune system, including the resident brain myeloid cells (microglia) and the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system.</p>

Stromal <i>Gli2</i> activity coordinates a niche signaling program for mammary epithelial stem cells
<p>The stem cell niche is a complex local signaling microenvironment that sustains stem cell activity during organ maintenance and regeneration.

Site-specific phosphorylation of tau inhibits amyloid-β toxicity in Alzheimer’s mice
<p>Amyloid-β (Aβ) toxicity in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is considered to be mediated by phosphorylated tau protein. In contrast, we found that, at least in early disease, site-specific phosphorylation of tau inhibited Aβ toxicity. This specific tau phosphorylation was mediated by the neuronal p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase p38γ and interfered with postsynaptic excitotoxic signaling complexes engaged by Aβ. Accordingly, depletion of p38γ exacerbated neuronal circuit aberrations, cognitive deficits, and premature lethality in a mouse model of AD, whereas increasing the activity of p38γ abolished these deficits. Furthermore, mimicking site-specific tau phosphorylation alleviated Aβ-induced neuronal death and offered protection from excitotoxicity. Our work provides insights into postsynaptic processes in AD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s and challenges a purely pathogenic role of tau phosphorylation in neuronal toxicity.</p>

Senescent intimal foam cells are deleterious at all stages of atherosclerosis

Together, these results demonstrate that senescent cells are key drivers of atheroma formation and maturation and suggest that selective clearance of these cells by senolytic agents holds promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis.</p>

Pathological α-synuclein transmission initiated by binding lymphocyte-activation gene 3
<p>Emerging evidence indicates that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of Parkinson’s disease (PD) may be due to cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded preformed fibrils (PFF) of α-synuclein (α-syn).

Here, we show that LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) binds α-syn PFF with high affinity (dissociation constant = 77 nanomolar), whereas the α-syn monomer exhibited minimal binding. α-Syn-biotin PFF binding to LAG3 initiated α-syn PFF endocytosis, transmission, and toxicity. Lack of LAG3 substantially delayed α-syn PFF–induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo. The identification of LAG3 as a receptor that binds α-syn PFF provides a target for developing therapeutics designed to slow the progression of PD and related α-synucleinopathies.</p>

MAVS-dependent host species range and pathogenicity of human hepatitis A virus

We demonstrate that the capacity of HAV to evade MAVS-mediated type I interferon responses defines its host species range. HAV-induced liver injury was associated with interferon-independent intrinsic hepatocellular apoptosis and hepatic inflammation that unexpectedly resulted from MAVS and IRF3/7 signaling.

Recurrent somatic mutations underlie corticotropin-independent Cushing’s syndrome

We report a hotspot mutation (L206R) in <i>PRKACA</i>, which encodes the catalytic subunit of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)–dependent protein kinase (PKA), in more than 50% of cases with adrenocortical adenomas associated with corticotropin-independent Cushing’s syndrome. The L206R PRKACA mutant abolished its binding to the regulatory subunit of PKA (PRKAR1A) that inhibits catalytic activity of PRKACA, leading to constitutive, cAMP-independent PKA activation. These results highlight the major role of cAMP-independent activation of cAMP/PKA signaling by somatic mutations in corticotropin-independent Cushing’s syndrome, providing insights into the diagnosis and therapeutics of this syndrome.</p>

BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 Associates with Immune Receptors and Is Required for Immune Responses
<p>Plants utilize cell surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMP/DAMPs) and initiate pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Here, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 (BSK5), a member of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily XII, in PRR-initiated immunity. BSK5 localized to the plant cell periphery, interacted in yeast and in planta with multiple receptor-like kinases, including the ELONGATION FACTOR-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and PEP1 RECEPTOR1 (PEPR1) PRRs, and was phosphorylated in vitro by PEPR1 and EFR in the kinase activation loop. Consistent with a role in PTI, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants displayed enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and to the fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Furthermore, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants were impaired in several immune responses induced by the elf18, pep1, and flg22 PAMP/DAMPs, including resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>B. cinerea</i>, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition at the cell wall, and enhanced <i>PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1</i> gene expression. However, <i>bsk5</i> plants were not affected in PAMP/DAMP activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and expression of the <i>FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> or the WRKY domain-containing gene <i>WRKY29</i>. BSK5 variants mutated in the BSK5 myristoylation site, ATP-binding site, and kinase activation loop failed to complement defective PTI phenotypes of <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants, suggesting that localization to the cell periphery, kinase activity, and phosphorylation by PRRs are critical for the function of BSK5 in PTI. These findings demonstrate that BSK5 plays a role in PTI by interacting with multiple immune receptors.</p>

Loss of CRWN Nuclear Proteins Induces Cell Death and Salicylic Acid Defense Signaling
<p>Defects in the nuclear lamina of animal cell nuclei have dramatic effects on nuclear structure and gene expression as well as diverse physiological manifestations. We report that deficiencies in CROWDED NUCLEI (CRWN), which are candidate nuclear lamina proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), trigger widespread changes in transcript levels and whole-plant phenotypes, including dwarfing and spontaneous cell death lesions. These phenotypes are caused in part by ectopic induction of plant defense responses via the salicylic acid pathway. Loss of CRWN proteins induces the expression of the salicylic acid biosynthetic gene <i>ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1</i>, which leads to spontaneous defense responses in <i>crwn1 crwn2</i> and <i>crwn1 crwn4</i> mutants, which are deficient in two of the four CRWN paralogs. The symptoms of ectopic defense response, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s marker gene expression and cell death, increase in older <i>crwn</i> double mutants. These age-dependent effects are postulated to reflect an increase in nuclear dysfunction or damage over time, a phenomenon reminiscent of aging effects seen in animal nuclei and in some human laminopathy patients.</p>

The Wheat <i>Lr67</i> Gene from the Sugar Transport Protein 13 Family Confers Multipathogen Resistance in Barley
<p>Fungal pathogens are a major constraint to global crop production; hence, plant genes encoding pathogen resistance are important tools for combating disease. A few resistance genes identified to date provide partial, durable resistance to multiple pathogens and the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and resistant alleles – G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The barley ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in yeast as a high affinity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by ∼ 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in yeast was reduced when coexpressed with <i>Lr67res</i>. Stable transgenic <i>Lr67res</i> barley lines exhibited seedling resistance to the barley-specific pathogens <i>Puccinia hordei</i> and <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>, which cause leaf rust and powdery mildew, respectively. Barley plants expressing <i>Lr67res</i> exhibited early senescence and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s-related (<i>PR</i>) gene expression. Unlike previous observations implicating flavonoids in the resistance of transgenic sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) expressing <i>Lr34res</i>, another wheat multipathogen resistance gene, barley flavonoids are unlikely to have a role in Lr67res-mediated resistance. Similar to observations made in yeast, Lr67res reduced Glc uptake <i>in planta</i>. These results confirm that the pathway by which <i>Lr67res</i> confers resistance to fungal pathogens is conserved between wheat and barley.</p>

The Kinase OsCPK4 Regulates a Buffering Mechanism That Fine-Tunes Innate Immunity
<p>The calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 has been demonstrated to play important roles in salt and drought tolerance, plant growth, and development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying OsCPK4 function in rice immunity. In this study, we demonstrated that the generation of oxidative burst and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s-related gene expression triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns were significantly enhanced in the <i>oscpk4</i> mutants. These mutant lines are more resistant to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases than the wild-type plants, indicating that OsCPK4 negatively regulates innate immunity in rice. OsCPK4 was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176. OsRLCK176 accumulation is negatively regulated by OsCPK4. Interestingly, the kinase-dead OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation more strongly than the wild-type protein. OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 mutually phosphorylate each other and form a feedback loop. Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 contribute to the stability of OsRLCK176. These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation and restricts plant defenses, whereas the activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 degradation machinery, thus enhancing plant immunity. Collectively, the study proposes a novel defense buffering mechanism mediated by OsCPK4, which fine-tunes microbe-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice.</p>

5-Aminolevulinic Acid Dehydratase Gene Dosage Affects Programmed Cell Death and Immunity
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD) is an important form to protect plants from pathogen attack. However, plants must precisely control the PCD process under microbe attacks to avoid detrimental effects. The complexity of how plants balance the defense activation and PCD requires further clarification. Lesion mimic mutants constitute an excellent material to study the crosstalk between them. Here, we identified a <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> (cotton) lesion mimic mutant (<i>Ghlmm</i>), which exhibits necrotic leaf damage and enhanced disease resistance. Map-based cloning demonstrated that <i>GhLMMD</i>, encoding 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and located on chromosome D5, was responsible for the phenotype. The mutant was resulted from a nonsense mutation within the coding region of <i>GhLMMD</i>. It exhibited an overaccumulation of the 5-aminolevulinic acid, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and salicylic acid, along with constitutive expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s-related genes and enhanced resistance to the <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> infection. Interestingly, <i>GhLMM</i> plays a dosage-dependent role in regulating PCD of cotton leaves and resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> infection. This study provides a new strategy on the modulation of plant immunity, particularly in polyploidy plants.</p>

The Arabidopsis Mitochondrial Protease FtSH4 Is Involved in Leaf Senescence via Regulation of WRKY-Dependent Salicylic Acid Accumulation and Signaling
<p>Mitochondria and autophagy play important roles in the networks that regulate plant leaf senescence and cell death. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between mitochondrial signaling and autophagy are currently not well understood. This study characterized the function of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mitochondrial AAA-protease gene <i>FtSH4</i> in regulating autophagy and senescence, finding that FtSH4 mediates WRKY-dependent salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and signaling. Knockout of <i>FtSH4</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant resulted in severe leaf senescence, cell death, and high autophagy levels. The level of SA increased dramatically in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant. Expression of <i>nahG</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant led to decreased SA levels and suppressed the leaf senescence and cell death phenotypes. The transcript levels of several SA synthesis and signaling genes, including <i>SALICYLIC ACID</i> <i>INDUCTION DEFICIENT2</i> (<i>SID2</i>), <i>NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1</i> (<i>NDR1</i>), and <i>NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED PROTEINS1</i> (<i>NPR1</i>), increased significantly in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants compared with the wild type. Loss of function of <i>SID2</i>, <i>NDR1</i>, or <i>NPR1</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutant reversed the <i>ftsh4-4</i> senescence and autophagy phenotypes. Furthermore, <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants had elevated levels of transcripts of several <i>WRKY</i> genes, including <i>WRKY40</i>, <i>WRKY46</i>, <i>WRKY51</i>, <i>WRKY60</i>, <i>WRKY63</i>, and <i>WRKY75</i>; all of these WRKY proteins can bind to the promoter of <i>SID2</i>. Loss of function of <i>WRKY75</i> in the <i>ftsh4-4</i> mutants decreased the levels of SA and reversed the senescence phenotype. Taken together, these results suggest that the mitochondrial ATP-dependent protease FtSH4 may regulate the expression of <i>WRKY</i> genes by modifying the level of reactive oxygen species and the WRKY transcription factors that control SA synthesis and signaling in autophagy and senescence.</p>

An Ethylene-Induced Regulatory Module Delays Flower Senescence by Regulating Cytokinin Content
<p>In many plant species, including rose (<i>Rosa hybrida</i>), flower senescence is promoted by the gaseous hormone ethylene and inhibited by the cytokinin (CTK) class of hormones. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these antagonistic effects are not well understood. In this study, we characterized the association between a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s-related PR-10 family gene from rose (<i>RhPR10.1</i>) and the hormonal regulation of flower senescence. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis showed that <i>RhPR10.1</i> was expressed at high levels during senescence in different floral organs, including petal, sepal, receptacle, stamen, and pistil, and that expression was induced by ethylene treatment. Silencing of <i>RhPR10.1</i> expression in rose plants by virus-induced gene silencing accelerated flower senescence, which was accompanied by a higher ion leakage rate in the petals, as well as increased expression of the senescence marker gene <i>RhSAG12</i>. CTK content and the expression of three CTK signaling pathway genes were reduced in <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants, and the accelerated rate of petal senescence that was apparent in the <i>RhPR10.1</i>-silenced plants was restored to normal levels by CTK treatment. Finally, RhHB6, a homeodomain-Leu zipper I transcription factor, was observed to bind to the <i>RhPR10.1</i> promoter, and silencing of its expression also promoted flower senescence. Our results reveal an ethylene-induced RhHB6-RhPR10.1 regulatory module that functions as a brake of ethylene-promoted senescence through increasing the CTK content.</p>

Degenerative subtalar joints complicated by medial plantar intraneural cysts
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of intraneural ganglion cysts is controversial.   Recent reports in the literature described medial plantar intraneural   ganglion cysts (mIGC) with articular branches to subtalar joints.

Balance between the two kinin receptors in the progression of experimental focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis in mice
<p>Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is one of the most important renal diseases related to end-stage renal failure. Bradykinin has been implicated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of renal inflammation, whereas the role of its receptor 2 (B2RBK; also known as BDKRB2) in FSGS has not been studied. FSGS was induced in wild-type and B2RBK-knockout mice by a single intravenous injection of Adriamycin (ADM). In order to further modulate the kinin receptors, the animals were also treated with the B2RBK antagonist HOE-140 and the B1RBK antagonist DALBK. Here, we show that the blockage of B2RBK with HOE-140 protects mice from the development of FSGS, including podocyte foot process effacement and the re-establishment of slit-diaphragm-related proteins. However, B2RBK-knockout mice were not protected from FSGS. These opposite results were due to B1RBK expression. B1RBK was upregulated after the injection of ADM and this upregulation was exacerbated in B2RBK-knockout animals. Furthermore, treatment with HOE-140 downregulated the B1RBK receptor. The blockage of B1RBK in B2RBK-knockout animals promoted FSGS regression, with a less-inflammatory phenotype. These results indicate a deleterious role of both kinin receptors in an FSGS model and suggest a possible cross-talk between them in the progression of disease.</p>

Mouse models of telomere dysfunction phenocopy skeletal changes found in human age-related osteoporosis
<p>A major medical challenge in the elderly is osteoporosis and the high risk of fracture. Telomere dysfunction is a cause of cellular senescence and telomere shortening, which occurs with age in cells from most human tissues, including bone. Telomere defects contribute to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of two progeroid disorders characterized by premature osteoporosis, Werner syndrome and dyskeratosis congenital. It is hypothesized that telomere shortening contributes to bone aging. We evaluated the skeletal phenotypes of mice with disrupted telomere maintenance mechanisms as models for human bone aging, including mutants in Werner helicase (<i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i>), telomerase (<i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i>) and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> double mutants. Compared with young wild-type (WT) mice, micro-computerized tomography analysis revealed that young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have decreased trabecular bone volume, trabecular number and trabecular thickness, as well as increased trabecular spacing. In cortical bone, young <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice have increased cortical thinning, and increased porosity relative to age-matched WT mice. These trabecular and cortical changes were accelerated with age in <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice compared with older WT mice. Histological quantification of osteoblasts in aged mice showed a similar number of osteoblasts in all genotypes; however, significant decreases in osteoid, mineralization surface, mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate in older <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> bone suggest that osteoblast dysfunction is a prominent feature of precocious aging in these mice. Except in the <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup></i> single mutant, osteoclast number did not increase in any genotype. Significant alterations in mechanical parameters (structure model index, degree of anistrophy and moment of inertia) of the <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> femurs compared with WT mice were also observed. Young <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mice had a statistically significant increase in bone-marrow fat content compared with young WT mice, which remained elevated in aged double mutants. Taken together, our results suggest that <i>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> and <i>Wrn<sup>−/−</sup>Terc<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants recapitulate the human bone aging phenotype and are useful models for studying age-related osteoporosis.</p>

Functional analysis of a zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant identifies key transcriptional components of the innate immune system
<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an important class of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize microbial and danger signals. Their downstream signaling upon ligand binding is vital for initiation of the innate immune response. In human and mammalian models, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) is known for its central role as an adaptor molecule in interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) and TLR signaling. The zebrafish is increasingly used as a complementary model system for disease research and drug screening. Here, we describe a zebrafish line with a truncated version of MyD88 as the first zebrafish mutant for a TLR signaling component. We show that this immune-compromised mutant has a lower survival rate under standard rearing conditions and is more susceptible to challenge with the acute bacterial pathogens <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. Microarray and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that expression of genes for transcription factors central to innate immunity (including NF-ĸB and AP-1) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b, is dependent on MyD88 signaling during these bacterial infections. Nevertheless, expression of immune genes independent of MyD88 in the <i>myd88</i> mutant line was sufficient to limit growth of an attenuated <i>S. typhimurium</i> strain. In the case of infection with the chronic bacterial pathogen <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>, we show that MyD88 signaling has an important protective role during early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s. During mycobacterial infection, the <i>myd88</i> mutant shows accelerated formation of granuloma-like aggregates and increased bacterial burden, with associated lower induction of genes central to innate immunity. This zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant will be a valuable tool for further study of the role of IL1R and TLR signaling in the innate immunity processes underlying infectious diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer.</p>

The fraction of strongly bound cross-bridges is increased in mice that carry the myopathy-linked myosin heavy chain mutation MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>
<p>Myosinopathies have emerged as a new group of diseases and are caused by mutations in genes encoding myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. One major hallmark of these diseases is skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of muscle fibers from <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i> mice, which carry a mutation that provokes an L342Q change within the catalytic domain of the type IIb skeletal muscle myosin protein MYH4. Because homozygous animals develop rapid muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis, they must be killed by postnatal day 13, so all experiments were performed using skeletal muscles from adult heterozygous animals (<i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+). <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice contain MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup> expressed at 7% of the levels of the wild-type (WT) protein, and are overtly and histologically normal. However, mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized fibers revealed, upon maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, higher stiffness as well as altered meridional and equatorial reflections in <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice when compared with age-matched WT animals. Under rigor conditions, by contrast, no difference was observed between <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ and WT mice. Altogether, these findings prove that, in adult <i>MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup></i> heterozygous mice, the transition from weak to strong myosin cross-bridge binding is facilitated, increasing the number of strongly attached myosin heads, thus enhancing force production. These changes are predictably exacerbated in the type IIb fibers of homozygous mice, in which the embryonic myosin isoform is fully replaced by MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>, leading to a hypercontraction, muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of skeletal myosinopathies.</p>

Circulating autoantibodies, lung perivascular lymphoid tissue, and elevated cytokines have been related to PAH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s but without a clear understanding of how these abnormalities are initiated, perpetuated, and connected in the progression of disease. We therefore set out to identify specific target antigens in PAH lung immune complexes as a starting point toward resolving these issues to better inform future application of immunomodulatory therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lung immune complexes were isolated and PAH target antigens were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and localized by confocal microscopy. One PAH antigen linked to immunity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured monocytes and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and lung studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate immune factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in immune complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control lungs. Elevated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control lungs (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were elevated in PAH versus control lungs (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating monocytes, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an interleukin 6-independent manner. Furthermore, 3 weekly injections of HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced hemodynamic and vascular changes of pulmonary hypertension in rats (n=8) and elevated interleukin 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study reveals that upregulation of the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K could both initiate and sustain activation of the immune system and cause vascular changes associated with PAH.</p></sec>

Association Between Fetal Congenital Heart Defects and Maternal Risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in the Same Pregnancy and Across Pregnancies
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Both pregnant women carrying fetuses with heart defects and women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy often exhibit angiogenic imbalances, suggesting that the same mechanisms are involved in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of the former and the pathophysiology of the latter. We conducted a register-based cohort study to determine whether offspring congenital heart defects are associated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and whether the mechanisms driving any association are primarily maternal or fetal.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among singleton pregnancies without chromosomal abnormalities lasting ≥20 weeks in Denmark from 1978 to 2011 (n= 1 972 857), we identified pregnancies complicated by offspring congenital heart defects or early preterm preeclampsia, late preterm preeclampsia, term preeclampsia, and gestational hypertension. We used polytomous logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for associations between offspring congenital heart defects and maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy overall and for specific heart defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Offspring congenital heart defects were strongly associated with early preterm preeclampsia (OR, 7.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.11–8.03) and late preterm preeclampsia (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.38–3.34) in the same pregnancy and weakly associated with term preeclampsia (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06–1.27), but they were not associated with gestational hypertension (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25). Association strengths were consistent across heart defect types. Offspring congenital heart defects in a previous pregnancy were also strongly associated with preterm preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies (early preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.68–3.34; late preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.52–2.75) but were only modestly associated with term preeclampsia and not associated with gestational hypertension. Similarly, preterm preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, but not term preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, was associated with offspring congenital heart defects in later pregnancies (early preterm preeclampsia: OR, 7.91; 95% CI, 6.06–10.3; late preterm preeclampsia: OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 2.11–3.79; term preeclampsia: OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88–1.10; gestational hypertension: OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.92–1.38).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Linked pathophysiological mechanisms may be involved in some congenital heart defects and preterm preeclampsia. The strong associations across pregnancies support a predominantly maternal origin of effect.</p></sec>

Transcription Factor RUNX1 Regulates Platelet <i>PCTP</i> (Phosphatidylcholine Transfer Protein): Implications for Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>PCTP (phosphatidylcholine transfer protein) regulates the intermembrane transfer of phosphatidylcholine. Higher platelet PCTP expression is associated with increased platelet responses on activation of protease-activated receptor 4 thrombin receptors noted in black subjects compared with white subjects. Little is known about the regulation of platelet <i>PCTP</i>. Haplodeficiency of RUNX1, a major hematopoietic transcription factor, is associated with thrombocytopenia and impaired platelet responses on activation. Platelet expression profiling of a patient with a <i>RUNX1</i> loss-of-function mutation revealed a 10-fold downregulation of the <i>PCTP</i> gene compared with healthy controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We pursued the hypothesis that <i>PCTP</i> is regulated by RUNX1 and that <i>PCTP</i> expression is correlated with cardiovascular events. We studied RUNX1 binding to the <i>PCTP</i> promoter using DNA-protein binding studies and human erythroleukemia cells and promoter activity using luciferase reporter studies. We assessed the relationship between <i>RUNX1</i> and <i>PCTP</i> in peripheral blood RNA and <i>PCTP</i> and death or myocardial infarction in 2 separate patient cohorts (587 total patients) with cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Platelet PCTP protein in the patient was reduced by ≈50%. DNA-protein binding studies showed RUNX1 binding to consensus sites in ≈1 kB of <i>PCTP</i> promoter. <i>PCTP</i> expression was increased with <i>RUNX1</i> overexpression and reduced with <i>RUNX1</i> knockdown in human erythroleukemia cells, indicating that <i>PCTP</i> is regulated by RUNX1. Studies in 2 cohorts of patients showed that <i>RUNX1</i> expression in blood correlated with <i>PCTP</i> gene expression; <i>PCTP</i> expression was higher in black compared with white subjects and was associated with future death/myocardial infarction after adjustment for age, sex, and race (odds ratio, 2.05; 95% confidence interval 1.6–2.7; <i>P</i><0.0001). <i>RUNX1</i> expression is known to initiate at 2 alternative promoters, a distal P1 and a proximal P2 promoter. In patient cohorts, there were differential effects of <i>RUNX1</i> isoforms on <i>PCTP</i> expression with a negative correlation in blood between <i>RUNX1</i> expressed from the P1 promoter and <i>PCTP</i> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><i>PCTP</i> is a direct transcriptional target of RUNX1. <i>PCTP</i> expression is associated with death/myocardial infarction in patients with cardiovascular disease. RUNX1 regulation of <i>PCTP</i> may play a role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of platelet-mediated cardiovascular events.</p></sec>

High-Intensity Interval Training in Patients With Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Small studies have suggested that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is superior to moderate continuous training (MCT) in reversing cardiac remodeling and increasing aerobic capacity in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The present multicenter trial compared 12 weeks of supervised interventions of HIIT, MCT, or a recommendation of regular exercise (RRE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Two hundred sixty-one patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% and New York Heart Association class II to III were randomly assigned to HIIT at 90% to 95% of maximal heart rate, MCT at 60% to 70% of maximal heart rate, or RRE. Thereafter, patients were encouraged to continue exercising on their own. Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, after the intervention, and at follow-up after 52 weeks. Primary end point was a between-group comparison of change in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter from baseline to 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Groups did not differ in age (median, 60 years), sex (19% women), ischemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s (59%), or medication. Change in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter from baseline to 12 weeks was not different between HIIT and MCT (<i>P</i>=0.45); left ventricular end-diastolic diameter changes compared with RRE were −2.8 mm (−5.2 to −0.4 mm; <i>P</i>=0.02) in HIIT and −1.2 mm (−3.6 to 1.2 mm; <i>P</i>=0.34) in MCT. There was also no difference between HIIT and MCT in peak oxygen uptake (<i>P</i>=0.70), but both were superior to RRE. However, none of these changes was maintained at follow-up after 52 weeks. Serious adverse events were not statistically different during supervised intervention or at follow-up at 52 weeks (HIIT, 39%; MCT, 25%; RRE, 34%; <i>P</i>=0.16). Training records showed that 51% of patients exercised below prescribed target during supervised HIIT and 80% above target in MCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>HIIT was not superior to MCT in changing left ventricular remodeling or aerobic capacity, and its feasibility remains unresolved in patients with heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Plasma Metabolomics Implicates Modified Transfer RNAs and Altered Bioenergetics in the Outcomes of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a heterogeneous disorder with high mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a comprehensive study of plasma metabolites using ultraperformance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to identify patients at high risk of early death, to identify patients who respond well to treatment, and to provide novel molecular insights into disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fifty-three circulating metabolites distinguished well-phenotyped patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH (n=365) from healthy control subjects (n=121) after correction for multiple testing (<i>P</i><7.3e-5) and confounding factors, including drug therapy, and renal and hepatic impairment. A subset of 20 of 53 metabolites also discriminated patients with PAH from disease control subjects (symptomatic patients without pulmonary hypertension, n=139). Sixty-two metabolites were prognostic in PAH, with 36 of 62 independent of established prognostic markers. Increased levels of tRNA-specific modified nucleosides (N2,N2-dimethylguanosine, N1-methylinosine), tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (malate, fumarate), glutamate, fatty acid acylcarnitines, tryptophan, and polyamine metabolites and decreased levels of steroids, sphingomyelins, and phosphatidylcholines distinguished patients from control subjects. The largest differences correlated with increased risk of death, and correction of several metabolites over time was associated with a better outcome. Patients who responded to calcium channel blocker therapy had metabolic profiles similar to those of healthy control subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Metabolic profiles in PAH are strongly related to survival and should be considered part of the deep phenotypic characterization of this disease. Our results support the investigation of targeted therapeutic strategies that seek to address the alterations in translational regulation and energy metabolism that characterize these patients.</p></sec>

Risk of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction in Older Women After Contemporary Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes are resistant to radiation. However, cardiac radiation exposure causes coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation, a perturbation implicated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pathogenesi</span></strong>s of heart failure (HF) and particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Radiotherapy for breast cancer results in variable cardiac radiation exposure and may increase the risk of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a population-based case-control study of incident HF in 170 female residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (59 cases and 111 controls), who underwent contemporary (1998–2013) radiotherapy for breast cancer with computed tomography–assisted radiotherapy planning. Controls were matched to cases for age, tumor side, chemotherapy use, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Mean cardiac radiation dose (MCRD) in each patient was calculated from the patient’s computed tomography images and radiotherapy plan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean age at radiotherapy was 69±9 years. Of HF cases, 38 (64%) had EF≥50% (HFpEF), 18 (31%) had EF<50% (HF with reduced EF), and 3 (5%) did not have EF measured. The EF was ≥40% in 50 of the 56 HF cases (89%) with an EF measurement. The mean interval from radiotherapy to HF was 5.8±3.4 years. The odds of HF was higher in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease or atrial fibrillation. The MCRD was 2.5 Gy (range, 0.2–13.1 Gy) and higher in cases (3.3±2.7 Gy) than controls (2.1±2.0 Gy; <i>P</i>=0.004). The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for HF per log MCRD was 9.1 (3.4–24.4) for any HF, 16.9 (3.9–73.7) for HFpEF, and 3.17 (0.8–13.0) for HF with reduced EF. The increased odds of any HF or HFpEF with increasing MCRD remained significant after adjustment for HF risk factors and in sensitivity analyses matching by cancer stage rather than tumor side. Only 18.6% of patients experienced new or recurrent ischemic events between radiotherapy and the onset of HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The relative risk of HFpEF increases with increasing cardiac radiation exposure during contemporary conformal breast cancer radiotherapy. These data emphasize the importance of radiotherapy techniques that limit MCRD during breast cancer treatment. Moreover, these data provide further support for the importance of coronary microvascular compromise in the pathophysiology of HFpEF.</p></sec>

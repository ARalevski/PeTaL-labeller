Structure of a eukaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel at near-atomic resolution
<p>Voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels are responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials. They are associated with a variety of channelopathies and are targeted by multiple pharmaceutical drugs and natural toxins. Here, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of a putative Na<sub>v</sub> channel from American cockroach (designated Na<sub>v</sub>PaS) at 3.8 angstrom resolution. The voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the four repeats exhibit distinct conformations. The entrance to the asymmetric selectivity filter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vestibul</span></strong>e is guarded by heavily glycosylated and disulfide bondâ€“stabilized extracellular loops. On the cytoplasmic side, a conserved amino-terminal domain is placed below VSD<sub>I</sub>, and a carboxy-terminal domain binds to the III-IV linker. The structure of Na<sub>v</sub>PaS establishes an important foundation for understanding function and disease mechanism of Na<sub>v</sub> and related voltage-gated calcium channels.</p>

Hearing on the fly: the effects of wing position on noctuid moth hearing
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Noctuid moth wing position affects neural hearing sensitivity. No significant differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eardrum</span></strong> movement occur; therefore, differences are hypothesized to be due to internal factors such as muscle tension.</p>

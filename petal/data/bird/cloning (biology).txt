The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic traits are controlled by many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, but a global picture of the genotype–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rally how many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s affect a trait and how large these effects are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are shaped by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the reverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding yeast strains, each of which lacks a nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. We show that 1) the proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are impacted by many more small-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s than large-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and 3) the mean effect of all nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on a trait decreases precipitously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion traits in 754 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of genome-wide reverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics in genotype–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e mapping, uncover an enormous range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic complexity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been shaped by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as genomic neighborhoods containing several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of genomic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical distribution of individual members of families of duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian genomes. Differences between previously annotated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, the inclusion or absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the CTDGs and their corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters, and the splitting of certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several well-known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally distributed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic diversity.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are located. These results provide insights into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

Gcorn Plant: A Database for Retrieving Functional and Evolutionary Traits of Plant Genes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> homology helps us understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> function and speciation. The number of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and species registered in public databanks is continuously increasing. It is useful to associate homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s of various plants to better understand plant speciation. We designed the Gcorn plant database for the retrieval of information on homology and evolution of a plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> of interest. Amino acid sequences of 73 species (62 land plants and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 sequences, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these sequences, homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> of interest, a phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic tree, connecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with high homology indices, and line charts of the numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and on a phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. Gcorn plant provides information on homologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s at various virtual time points along with speciation in plants.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s moderately inhibited the formation of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the formation of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration formation. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s cooperatively induced the formation of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

Stability of Single-Parent Gene Expression Complementation in Maize Hybrids upon Water Deficit Stress
<p>Heterosis is the superior performance of F1 hybrids compared with their homozygous, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically distinct parents. In this study, we monitored the transcriptomic divergence of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) inbred lines B73 and Mo17 and their reciprocal F1 hybrid progeny in primary roots under control and water deficit conditions simulated by polyethylene glycol treatment. Single-parent expression (SPE) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s is an extreme instance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion complementation, in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are active in only one of two parents but are expressed in both reciprocal hybrids. In this study, 1,997 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in B73 and 2,024 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s only expressed in Mo17 displayed SPE complementation under control and water deficit conditions. As a consequence, the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in hybrids exceeded the number of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in the parental inbred lines significantly independent of treatment. SPE patterns were substantially more stable to expression changes by water deficit treatment than other genotype-specific expression profiles. While, on average, 75% of all SPE patterns were not altered in response to polyethylene glycol treatment, only 17% of the remaining genotype-specific expression patterns were not changed by water deficit. Nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that lack syntenic orthologs in other grass species, and thus evolved late in the grass lineage, were significantly overrepresented among SPE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Hence, the significant overrepresentation of nonsyntenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s among SPE patterns and their stability under water limitation might suggest a function of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s during the early developmental manifestation of heterosis under fluctuating environmental conditions in hybrid progeny of the inbred lines B73 and Mo17.</p>

Primary Myocardial Fibrosis as an Alternative Phenotype Pathway of Inherited Cardiac Structural Disorders
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial fibrosis is a common postmortem finding among young individuals with sudden cardiac death. Because there is no known single cause, we tested the hypothesis that some cases of myocardial fibrosis in the absence of identifiable causes (primary myocardial fibrosis [PMF]) are associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic variants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Tissue was obtained at autopsy from 4031 consecutive individuals with sudden cardiac death in Northern Finland, among whom PMF was the only structural finding in 145 subjects with sudden cardiac death. We performed targeted next-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration sequencing using a panel of 174 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s associated with myocardial structure and ion channel function when autopsies did not identify a secondary basis for myocardial fibrosis. All variants with an effect on protein and with a minor allele frequency <0.01 were classified as pathogenic or variants of uncertain significance on the basis of American College of Medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics consensus guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 96 specimens with DNA passing quality control (66%), postmortem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic tests identified 24 variants of known or uncertain significance in 26 subjects (27%). Ten were pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 10 subjects (10%), and 14 were variants of uncertain significance in 11 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s among 16 subjects (17%). Five variants were in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, 6 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy–associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and 11 in dilated cardiomyopathy–associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s; 2 were not associated with these disorders. Four unique variants of uncertain significance cosegregated among multiple unrelated subjects with PMF. No pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were detected in ion channel–encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A large proportion of subjects with PMF at autopsy had variants in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without autopsy findings of those diseases, suggesting that PMF can be an alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic expression of structural disease–associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic variants or that risk-associated fibrosis was expressing before the primary disease.

miR-22 Is a Novel Mediator of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Modulation and Neointima Formation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>MicroRNA-22 (miR-22) has recently been reported to play a regulatory role during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from stem cells, but little is known about its target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and related pathways in mature VSMC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic modulation or its clinical implication in neointima formation following vascular injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a wire-injury mouse model, and local delivery of AgomiR-22 or miR-22 inhibitor, as well, to explore the therapeutic potential of miR-22 in vascular diseases. Furthermore, normal and diseased human femoral arteries were harvested, and various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models of VSMC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e switching were conducted to examine miR-22 expression during VSMC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e switching.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Expression of miR-22 was closely regulated during VSMC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic modulation. miR-22 overexpression significantly increased expression of VSMC marker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, whereas the opposite effect was observed when endogenous miR-22 was knocked down. As expected, 2 previously reported miR-22 target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and histone deacetylase 4, exhibited a regulatory role in VSMC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic modulation. A transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein, EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 protein homolog), has been identified as a novel miR-22 target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in VSMC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic modulation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of miR-22 in the injured vessels significantly reduced the expression of its target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries, whereas the opposite effect was observed with local application of a miR-22 inhibitor to injured arteries. We next examined the clinical relevance of miR-22 expression and its target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in human femoral arteries. We found that miR-22 expression was significantly reduced, whereas MECP2 and EVI1 expression levels were dramatically increased, in diseased in comparison with healthy femoral human arteries. This inverse relationship between miR-22 and MECP2 and EVI1 was evident in both healthy and diseased human femoral arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate that miR-22 and EVI1 are novel regulators of VSMC function, specifically during neointima hyperplasia, offering a novel therapeutic opportunity for treating vascular diseases.</p></sec>

Genetic Risk Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. This inverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-for-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> interactions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on statistical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> function. We used a combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of statistical association, proximity to annotated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> models, and root or nodule expression. We found statistically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse muta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis technologies to discover and validate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics in identifying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

The Evolution of Innate Immune Genes: Purifying and Balancing Selection on β-Defensins in Waterfowl
<p>In disease dynamics, high immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> diversity can confer a selective advantage to hosts in the face of a rapidly evolving and diverse pathogen fauna. This is supported empirically for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen recognition and signalling. In contrast, effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pathogen clearance may be more constrained. β-Defensins are innate immune effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s; their main mode of action is via disruption of microbial membranes. Here, five β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were characterized in mallards (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) and other waterfowl; key reservoir species for many zoonotic diseases. All five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showed remarkably low diversity at the individual-, population-, and species-level. Furthermore, there was widespread sharing of identical alleles across species divides. Thus, specific β-defensin alleles were maintained not only spatially but also over long temporal scales, with many amino acid residues being fixed across all species investigated. Purifying selection to maintain individual, highly efficacious alleles was the primary evolutionary driver of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in waterfowl. However, we also found evidence for balancing selection acting on the most recently duplicated β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>AvBD3b</i>). For this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, we found that amino acid replacements were more likely to be radical changes, suggesting that duplication of β-defensin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s allows exploration of wider functional space. Structural conservation to maintain function appears to be crucial for avian β-defensin effector molecules, resulting in low tolerance for new allelic variants. This contrasts with other types of innate immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, such as receptor and signalling molecules, where balancing selection to maintain allelic diversity has been shown to be a strong evolutionary force.</p>

Evidence for Selection on Gene Expression in Cultivated Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)
<p>Artificial selection has been used throughout plant domestication and breeding to develop crops that are adapted to diverse environments. Here, we investigate whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulatory changes have been widespread targets of lineage-specific selection in cultivated lines Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97 of rice, <i>Oryza sativa</i>. A line experiencing positive selection for either an increase or a decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s' transcript abundances is expected to have an overabundance of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) alleles that increase or decrease those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s' expression, respectively. Results indicate that several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that share <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> Ontology terms or are members of the same coexpression module have eQTL alleles from one parent that consistently increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion relative to the second parent. A second line of evidence for lineage-specific selection is an overabundance of <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL alleles that affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in the same direction (are reinforcing). Across all <i>cis–trans</i> pairs of eQTL, including pairs that both weakly and strongly affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion, there is no evidence for selection. However, the frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with reinforcing eQTL increases with eQTL strength. Therefore, there is evidence that eQTL with strong effects were positively selected during rice cultivation. Among 41 <i>cis–trans</i> pairs with strong <i>trans</i> eQTL, 31 have reinforcing eQTL. Several of the candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s under positive selection accurately predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic differences between Minghui 63 and Zhenshan 97. Overall, our results suggest that positive selection for regulatory alleles may be a key factor in plant improvement.</p>

Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>De<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s supports a role for GC-biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and close to two for Z-linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Histopathology reveals correlative and unique phenotypes in a high-throughput mouse phenotyping screen

In collaboration with the Pathology Core of the Centre for Modeling Human Disease (CMHD) we report the utility of histopathology in a high-throughput primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing screen. Histopathology was assessed in an unbiased selection of 50 mouse lines with (<i>n</i>=30) or without (<i>n</i>=20) clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es detected by the standard MGP primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing screen. Our findings revealed that histopathology added correlating morphological data in 19 of 30 lines (63.3%) in which the primary screen detected a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e. In addition, seven of the 50 lines (14%) presented significant histopathology findings that were not associated with or predicted by the standard primary screen. Three of these seven lines had no clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e detected by the standard primary screen. Incidental and strain-associated background lesions were present in all mutant lines with good concordance to wild-type controls. These findings demonstrate the complementary and unique contribution of histopathology to high-throughput primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing of mutant mice.</p>

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic variants in 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other diseases.

Common Genetic Variant Risk Score Is Associated With Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-induced QT interval prolongation, a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications.

Chromatin three-dimensional interactions mediate genetic effects on gene expression
<p>Studying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion and chromatin organization is key to characterizing the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic variability on the function and structure of the human genome. Here we unravel how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic variation perturbs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulation using a dataset combining activity of regulatory elements, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic variants across 317 individuals and two cell types. We show that variability in regulatory activity is structured at the intra- and interchromosomal levels within 12,583 cis-regulatory domains and 30 trans-regulatory hubs that highly reflect the local (that is, topologically associating domains) and global (that is, open and closed chromatin compartments) nuclear chromatin organization. These structures delimit cell type–specific regulatory networks that control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion and coexpression and mediate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic effects of cis- and trans-acting regulatory variants on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s.</p>

If two deletions don't stop growth, try three
<p>How many and which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s does an organism need at a minimum to sustain growth? With the identification of essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in a variety of organisms such as yeast (<i>1</i>), worms (<i>2</i>), and human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cultured cel</span></strong>ls (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>), the answer may seem obvious: Remove all nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and the organism should be able to continue to survive and grow. In the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the workhorse of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic interaction mapping, ∼1000 of the ∼6000 (∼17%) protein-coding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are essential for viability (<i>1</i>). So theoretically, one might think that one could remove the other ∼5000 nonessential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and still have a growing yeast. The reason this does not work is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s interact with each other to drive different traits, including viability and growth. On page 283 of this issue, Kuzmin <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) provide the first systematic analysis of trigenic interactions in yeast in which three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> deletions are combined in individual strains in order to ascertain the importance of multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> interactions for growth.

Exploring genetic suppression interactions on a global scale
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic suppression occurs when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic defects caused by a mutation in a particular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> are rescued by a mutation in a second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. To explore the principles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic suppression, we examined both literature-curated and unbiased experimental data, involving systematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mapping and whole-genome sequencing, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rate a large-scale suppression network among yeast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Most suppression pairs identified novel relationships among functionally related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, providing new insights into the functional wiring diagram of the cell. In addition to suppressor mutations, we identified frequent secondary mutations,in a subset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, that likely cause a delay in the onset of stationary phase, which appears to promote their enrichment within a propagating population. These findings allow us to formulate and quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ral mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic suppression.</p>

This comprehensive network maps <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic interactions for essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pairs, highlighting essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s as densely connected hubs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments. Negative interactions connected functionally related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, mapped core bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, whereas positive interactions often mapped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ral regulatory connections among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> pairs, rather than shared functionality.

Transcriptomic Insights into Phenological Development and Cold Tolerance of Wheat Grown in the Field
<p>Cold acclimation and winter survival in cereal species is determined by complicated environmentally regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion. However, studies investigating these complex cold responses are mostly conducted in controlled environments that only consider the responses to single environmental variables. In this study, we have comprehensively profiled global transcriptional responses in crowns of field-grown spring and winter wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) genotypes and their near-isogenic lines with the <i>VRN-A1</i> alleles swapped. This in-depth analysis revealed multiple signaling, interactive pathways that influence cold tolerance and phenological development to optimize plant growth and development in preparation for a wide range of over-winter stresses. Investigation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic differences at the <i>VRN-A1</i> locus revealed that a vernalization requirement maintained a higher level of cold response pathways while <i>VRN-A1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically promoted floral development. Our results also demonstrated the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic background on the expression of cold and flowering pathways. The link between delayed shoot apex development and the induction of cold tolerance was reflected by the gradual up-regulation of abscisic acid-dependent and C-REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR pathways. This was accompanied by the down-regulation of key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in meristem development as the autumn progressed. The chromosome location of differentially expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the winter and spring wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic backgrounds showed a striking pattern of biased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion on chromosomes 6A and 6D, indicating a transcriptional regulation at the genome level. This finding adds to the complexity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic cascades and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> interactions that determine the evolutionary patterns of both phenological development and cold tolerance traits in wheat.</p>

The Conserved and Unique Genetic Architecture of Kernel Size and Weight in Maize and Rice
<p>Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a major staple crop. Maize kernel size and weight are important contributors to its yield. Here, we measured kernel length, kernel width, kernel thickness, hundred kernel weight, and kernel test weight in 10 recombinant inbred line populations and dissected their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic architecture using three statistical models. In total, 729 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, many of which were identified in all three models, including 22 major QTLs that each can explain more than 10% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic variation. To provide candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s for these QTLs, we identified 30 maize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that are orthologs of 18 rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s reported to affect rice seed size or weight. Interestingly, 24 of these 30 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are located in the identified QTLs or within 1 Mb of the significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We further confirmed the effects of five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on maize kernel size/weight in an independent association mapping panel with 540 lines by candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> association analysis. Lastly, the function of <i>ZmINCW1</i>, a homolog of rice <i>GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING1</i> that affects seed size and weight, was characterized in detail. <i>ZmINCW1</i> is close to QTL peaks for kernel size/weight (less than 1 Mb) and contains significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting kernel size/weight in the association panel. Overexpression of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> can rescue the reduced weight of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homozygous mutant line in the <i>AtcwINV2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (Arabidopsis ortholog of <i>ZmINCW1</i>). These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms affecting seed development are conserved in maize, rice, and possibly Arabidopsis.</p>

Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven stresses such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these stresses usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single stresses. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, drought, and heat stresses, as well as their double and triple stress combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-physiological acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined stresses. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat stress. Response patterns of differentially expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, under single and combined stresses (i.e. common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s), were maintained only among 37% of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that were uniquely expressed only under combined stresses (i.e. combination unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under combined stresses and limited ability to predict plant responses as different stresses are combined. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> subset was enriched with different biological processes. Common stress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were enriched with known stress response pathways, while combination unique-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were enriched with unique processes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve stress tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

To investigate the possibility that seminal fluid proteins arise through duplicates of female reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that become “co-opted” by males, we screened female reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in males that is transferred to females during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the female reproductive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the male RT and encodes a seminal fluid protein. Evolutionary and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> that was female-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved male-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one female-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> is essential for full fecundity, and both female-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s contribute singly or in combination to a female’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the male-expressed paralog had no significant effect on female fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family exert effects on females by acting on a common, female-expressed target. After duplication and male co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

Bloomsbury report on mouse embryo phenotyping: recommendations from the IMPC workshop on embryonic lethal screening
<p>Identifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that are important for embryo development is a crucial first step towards understanding their many functions in driving the ordered growth, differentiation and organo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis of embryos. It can also shed light on the origins of developmental disease and congenital abnormalities. Current international efforts to examine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> function in the mouse provide a unique opportunity to pinpoint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that are involved in embryo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis, owing to the emergence of embryonic lethal knockout mutants. Through internationally coordinated efforts, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) has <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated a public resource of mouse knockout strains and, in April 2012, the International Mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing Consortium (IMPC), supported by the EU InfraCoMP programme, convened a workshop to discuss developing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing pipeline for the investigation of embryonic lethal knockout lines. This workshop brought together over 100 scientists, from 13 countries, who are working in the academic and commercial research sectors, including experts and opinion leaders in the fields of embryology, animal imaging, data capture, quality control and annotation, high-throughput mouse production, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing, and reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> analysis. This article summarises the outcome of the workshop, including (1) the vital scientific importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing embryonic lethal mouse strains for basic and translational research; (2) a common framework to harmonise international efforts within this context; (3) the types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing that are likely to be most appropriate for systematic use, with a focus on 3D embryo imaging; (4) the importance of centralising data in a standardised form to facilitate data mining; and (5) the development of online tools to allow open access to and dissemination of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ing data.</p>

Lateral Gene Transfer from the Dead
<p>In phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic studies, the evolution of molecular sequences is assumed to have taken place along the phylogeny traced by the ancestors of extant species. In the presence of lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transfer, however, this may not be the case, because the species lineage from which a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> was transferred may have gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s outside the represented phylogeny by modeling the speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate that if the number of sampled species is small compared with the total number of existing species, the overwhelming majority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transfers involve speciation to and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to calculate the probability of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> tree and recover the maximum-likelihood reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near-universal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of transfer events (28%) appear to have topological signatures of evolution along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of transfers trace their ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

RNA Polymerase II Read-Through Promotes Expression of Neighboring Genes in SAL1-PAP-XRN Retrograde Signaling
<p>In plants, the molecular function(s) of the nucleus-localized 5′-3′ EXORIBONUCLEASES (XRNs) are unclear; however, their activity is reported to have a significant effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion and SAL1-mediated retrograde signaling. Using parallel analysis of RNA ends, we documented a dramatic increase in uncapped RNA substrates of the XRNs in both <i>sal1</i> and <i>xrn2xrn3</i> mutants. We found that a major consequence of reducing SAL1 or XRN activity was RNA Polymerase II 3′ read-through. This occurred at 72% of expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, demonstrating a major genome-wide role for the XRN-torpedo model of transcription termination in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Read-through is speculated to have a negative effect on transcript abundance; however, we did not observe this. Rather, we identified a strong association between read-through and increased transcript abundance of tandemly orientated downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, strongly correlated with the proximity (less than 1,000 bp) and expression of the upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. We observed read-through in the proximity of 903 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s up-regulated in the <i>sal1-8</i> retrograde signaling mutant; thus, this phenomenon may account directly for up to 23% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s up-regulated in <i>sal1-8</i>. Using <i>APX2</i> and <i>AT5G43770</i> as exemplars, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically uncoupled read-through loci from downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s to validate the principle of read-through-mediated mRNA regulation, providing one mechanism by which an ostensibly posttranscriptional exoribonuclease that targets uncapped RNAs could modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion.</p>

Engineering Artificial MicroRNAs for Multiplex Gene Silencing and Simplified Transgenic Screen

However, obtaining transgenic plants with maximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing remains a major technical challenge in current amiRNA applications. Here, we incorporated an empirically determined feature of effective amiRNAs to the amiRNA design and in silico <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated a database containing 533,429 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-specific amiRNAs for silencing 27,136 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with a genome coverage of 98.87%. In both single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> and multiple-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing, we observed an overall improvement in performance by amiRNAs designed using our strategy in Arabidopsis protoplasts and transgenic plants. In addition, the endogenous tRNA-processing system was used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rate multiple amiRNAs from tRNA-pre-amiRNA tandem repeats for multiplex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing. An intronic amiRNA-producing fluorescent reporter was explored as a visual screening strategy for transgenic Arabidopsis and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) plants with maximal whole-plant or cell type-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing.

<i>NLR</i> Mutations Suppressing Immune Hybrid Incompatibility and Their Effects on Disease Resistance
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic divergence between populations can lead to reproductive isolation. Hybrid incompatibilities (HI) represent intermediate points along a continuum toward speciation. In plants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic variation in disease resistance (<i>R</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s underlies several cases of HI. The progeny of a cross between Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) accessions Landsberg <i>erecta</i> (L<i>er</i>, Poland) and Kashmir2 (Kas2, central Asia) exhibits immune-related HI. This incompatibility is due to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic interaction between a cluster of eight <i>TNL (TOLL/INTERLEUKIN1 RECEPTOR-NUCLEOTIDE BINDING-LEU RICH REPEAT</i>) <i>RPP1</i> (<i>RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA1)</i>-<i>like</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (<i>R1</i>–<i>R8</i>) from L<i>er</i> and central Asian alleles of a <i>Strubbelig</i>-family receptor-like kinase (<i>SRF3</i>) from Kas2. In characterizing mutants altered in L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI, we mapped multiple mutations to the <i>RPP1</i>-like L<i>er</i> locus. Analysis of these <i>suppressor of Ler/Kas2 incompatibility</i> (<i>sulki</i>) mutants reveals complex, additive and epistatic interactions underlying <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus activity. The effects of these mutations were measured on basal defense, global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion, primary metabolism, and disease resistance to a local <i>Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis</i> isolate (<i>Hpa</i> Gw) collected from Gorzéáéáów (Gw), where the Landsberg accession originated. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion sectors and metabolic hallmarks identified for HI are both dependent and independent of <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> members. We establish that mutations suppressing immune-related L<i>er</i>/Kas2 HI do not compromise resistance to <i>Hpa</i> Gw. QTL mapping analysis of <i>Hpa</i> Gw resistance point to <i>RPP7</i> as the causal locus. This work provides insight into the complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic architecture of the <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> L<i>er</i> locus and immune-related HI in Arabidopsis and into the contributions of <i>RPP1</i>-<i>like</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s to HI and defense.</p>

Out of Water: The Origin and Early Diversification of Plant <i>R</i>-Genes
<p>During plant-pathogen interactions, plants use intracellular proteins with nucleotide-binding site and Leu-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains to detect pathogens. NBS-LRR proteins represent a major class of plant disease resistance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s (<i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s). Whereas <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s have been well characterized in angiosperms, little is known about their origin and early diversification. Here, we perform comprehensive evolutionary analyses of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in plants and report the identification of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in basal-branching streptophytes, including charophytes, liverworts, and mosses. Phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analyses suggest that plant <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s originated in charophytes and R-proteins diversified into TIR-NBS-LRR proteins and non-TIR-NBS-LRR proteins in charophytes. Moreover, we show that plant R-proteins evolved in a modular fashion through frequent gain or loss of protein domains. Most of the <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in basal-branching streptophytes underwent adaptive evolution, indicating an ancient involvement of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in plant-pathogen interactions. Our findings provide novel insights into the origin and evolution of <i>R</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and the mechanisms underlying colonization of terrestrial environments by plants.</p>

The <i>RIN-MC</i> Fusion of MADS-Box Transcription Factors Has Transcriptional Activity and Modulates Expression of Many Ripening Genes
<p>Fruit development and ripening is regulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic and environmental factors and is of critical importance for seed dispersal, reproduction, and fruit quality. Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>ripening inhibitor</i> (<i>rin</i>) mutant fruit have a classic ripening-inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e, which is attributed to a genomic DNA deletion resulting in the fusion of two truncated transcription factors, <i>RIN</i> and <i>MC</i>. In wild-type fruit, RIN, a MADS-box transcription factor, is a key regulator of the ripening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion network, with hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> targets controlling changes in color, flavor, texture, and taste during tomato fruit ripening; <i>MC</i>, on the other hand, has low expression in fruit, and the potential functions of the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in ripening remain unclear. Here, overexpression of <i>RIN-MC</i> in transgenic wild-type cv Ailsa Craig tomato fruits impaired several ripening processes, and down-regulating <i>RIN-MC</i> expression in the <i>rin</i> mutant was found to stimulate the normal yellow mutant fruit to produce a weak red color, suggesting a distinct negative role for <i>RIN-MC</i> in tomato fruit ripening. By comparative transcriptome analysis of <i>rin</i> and <i>rin 35S</i>::<i>RIN-MC</i> RNA interference fruits, a total of 1,168 and 1,234 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s were identified as potential targets of RIN-MC activation and inhibition. Furthermore, the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> was shown to be translated into a chimeric transcription factor that was localized to the nucleus and was capable of protein interactions with other MADS-box factors. These results indicated that tomato RIN-MC fusion plays a negative role in ripening and encodes a chimeric transcription factor that modulates the expression of many ripening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, thereby contributing to the <i>rin</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e.</p>

Arabidopsis Novel Glycine-Rich Plasma Membrane PSS1 Protein Enhances Disease Resistance in Transgenic Soybean Plants
<p>Nonhost resistance is defined as the immunity of a plant species to all nonadapted pathogen species. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ecotype Columbia-0 is nonhost to the oomycete plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> and the fungal plant pathogen <i>Fusarium virguliforme</i> that are pathogenic to soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>). Previously, we reported <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rating the <i>pss1</i> mutation in the <i>pen1-1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic background as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic mapping and characterization of the Arabidopsis nonhost resistance <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>-susceptible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> locus, <i>PSS1</i>. In this study, we identified six candidate <i>PSS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s by comparing single-nucleotide polymorphisms of (1) the bulked DNA sample of seven F<sub>2:3</sub> families homozygous for the <i>pss1</i> allele and (2) the <i>pen1-1</i> mutant with Columbia-0. Analyses of T-DNA insertion mutants for each of these candidate <i>PSS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s identified the <i>At3g59640</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> encoding a glycine-rich protein as the putative <i>PSS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. Later, complementation analysis confirmed the identity of <i>At3g59640</i> as the <i>PSS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>. <i>PSS1</i> is induced following <i>P. sojae</i> infection as well as expressed in an organ-specific manner. Coexpression analysis of the available transcriptomic data followed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction suggested that <i>PSS1</i> is coregulated with <i>ATG8a</i> (<i>At4g21980</i>), a core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in autophagy. PSS1 contains a predicted single membrane-spanning domain. Subcellular localization study indicated that it is an integral plasma membrane protein. Sequence analysis suggested that soybean is unlikely to contain a PSS1-like defense function. Following the introduction of <i>PSS1</i> into the soybean cultivar Williams 82, the transgenic plants exhibited enhanced resistance to <i>F. virguliforme</i>, the pathogen that causes sudden death syndrome.</p>

The <i>TRAF Mediated Gametogenesis Progression</i> (<i>TRAMGaP</i>) Gene Is Required for Megaspore Mother Cell Specification and Gametophyte Development
<p>In plants, the role of TRAF-like proteins with meprin and the TRAF homology (MATH) domain is far from clear. In animals, these proteins serve as adapter molecules to mediate signal transduction from Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor to downstream effector molecules. A seed-sterile mutant with a disrupted TRAF-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>At5g26290</i>) exhibiting aberrant gameto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis led us to investigate the developmental role of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The mutation was semidominant and resulted in pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es with such features as short siliques with fewer ovules, pollen and seed sterility, altered Megaspore Mother Cell (MMC) specification, and delayed programmed cell death in megaspores and the tapetum, features that overlapped those in other well-characterized mutants. Seed sterility and reduced transmission frequency of the mutant alleles pointed to a dual role, sporophytic and gametophytic, for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> on the male side. The mutant also showed altered expression of various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in such cellular and developmental pathways as regulation of transcription, biosynthesis and transport of lipids, hormone-mediated signaling, and gametophyte development. The diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es of the mutant and the altered expression of key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s related to gametophyte and seed development could be explained based on the functional similarly between <i>At5g26290</i> and MATH-BTB domain proteins that modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome system.

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated muta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis in plants enables the development of high-throughput muta<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis strategies. By transforming pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es with the underlying targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s.

Diversification of Root Hair Development Genes in Vascular Plants
<p>The molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic program for root hair development has been studied intensively in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). To understand the extent to which this program might operate in other plants, we conducted a large-scale comparative analysis of root hair development <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from diverse vascular plants, including eudicots, monocots, and a lycophyte. Combining phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tics and transcriptomics, we discovered conservation of a core set of root hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s across all vascular plants, which may derive from an ancient program for unidirectional cell growth coopted for root hair development during vascular plant evolution. Interestingly, we also discovered preferential diversification in the structure and expression of root hair development <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, relative to other root hair- and root-expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, among these species. These differences enabled the definition of sets of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> functions that were acquired or lost in specific lineages during vascular plant evolution. In particular, we found substantial divergence in the structure and expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s used for root hair patterning, suggesting that the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory mechanism is not shared by other species. To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive view of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in a single plant cell type across multiple species.</p>

Gibberellin Signaling Requires Chromatin Remodeler PICKLE to Promote Vegetative Growth and Phase Transitions
<p>PICKLE (PKL) is an ATP-dependent chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding domain (CHD3) chromatin remodeling enzyme in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Previous studies showed that PKL promotes embryonic-to-vegetative transition by inhibiting expression of seed-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s during seed germination. The <i>pkl</i> mutants display a low penetrance of the “pickle root” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e, with a thick and green primary root that retains embryonic characteristics. The penetrance of this pickle root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e in <i>pkl</i> is dramatically increased in gibberellin (GA)-deficient conditions. At adult stages, the <i>pkl</i> mutants are semidwarfs with delayed flowering time, which resemble reduced GA-signaling mutants. These findings suggest that PKL may play a positive role in regulating GA signaling. A recent biochemical analysis further showed that PKL and GA signaling repressors DELLAs antagonistically regulate hypocotyl cell elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s by direct protein-protein interaction. To elucidate further the role of PKL in GA signaling and plant development, we studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic interaction between PKL and DELLAs using the hextuple mutant containing <i>pkl</i> and <i>della</i> pentuple (<i>dP</i>) mutations. Here, we show that PKL is required for most of GA-promoted developmental processes, including vegetative growth such as hypocotyl, leaf, and inflorescence stem elongation, and phase transitions such as juvenile-to-adult leaf and vegetative-to-reproductive phase. The removal of all DELLA functions (in the <i>dP</i> background) cannot rescue these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es in <i>pkl</i>. RNA-sequencing analysis using the <i>ga1</i> (a GA-deficient mutant), <i>pkl</i>, and the <i>ga1 pkl</i> double mutant further shows that expression of 80% of GA-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in seedlings is PKL dependent, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s that function in cell elongation, cell division, and phase transitions. These results indicate that the CHD3 chromatin remodeler PKL is required for regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion during most of GA-regulated developmental processes.</p>

The canonical PP2A holoenzyme regulates multiple eukaryotic signaling pathways by dephosphorylating target proteins and contains a catalytic (C) subunit, a structural/scaffolding (A) subunit, and a regulatory (B) subunit. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding PP2A subunits have expanded into multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in both flowering plants and mammals, and the extent to which different isoform functions may overlap is not clearly understood. To gain insight into the diversification of PP2A subunits, we used phylo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of PP2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s encoding PP2A subunits in mammals represent ancient lineages that expanded early in vertebrate evolution, while flowering plant PP2A subunit lineages evolved much more recently. Despite this temporal difference, our data indicate that the expansion of PP2A subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families in both flowering plants and animals was driven by whole-genome duplications followed by nonrandom <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loss. Selection analysis suggests that the expansion of one B subunit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family (B56/PPP2R5) was driven by functional diversification rather than by the maintenance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> dosage. We also observed reduced expansion rates in three distinct B subunit subclades. One of these subclades plays a highly conserved role in cell division, while the distribution of a second subclade suggests a specialized function in supporting beneficial microbial associations. Thus, while whole-genome duplications have driven the expansion and diversification of most PP2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> families, members of functionally specialized subclades quickly revert to singleton status after duplication events.</p>

Transcriptional Gene Silencing Maintained by OTS1 SUMO Protease Requires a DNA-Dependent Polymerase V-Dependent Pathway
<p>The expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with aberrant structure is prevented at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation levels. Aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing at the posttranscriptional level is well studied; however, it is not well understood how aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are silenced at the transcriptional level. In this study, through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic screening a transgenic report line that harbors an aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> (<i>35S-LUC</i>, lacking 3′-untranslated region [3′-UTR]) and lacks luciferase (LUC) activity, we identify that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease <i>OTS1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> is required for maintaining the silence of the reporter <i>35S-LUC</i> and an endogenous mutator-like element <i>MULE-F19G14</i> at the transcriptional level, which requires DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) V and DDR complex, but not Pol IV. The increased transcripts in <i>ots1</i> mutants are terminated by the 3′-UTRs of downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. In addition to <i>ots1</i> mutations, mutations in several known or putative SUMO proteases and two SUMO E3 ligases, <i>SIZ1</i> and <i>MMS21</i>, have similar effects on this silencing regulation. Taken together, our results reveal that the enzymes involved in the SUMOylation process restrain aberrant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> transcription by using a downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> 3′-UTR, and this regulation requires a functional Pol V-dependent pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

Histone Modifications Define Expression Bias of Homoeologous Genomes in Allotetraploid Cotton
<p>Histone modifications regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in eukaryotes, but their roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes at the single cell level and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for analyzing individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. Here, we comparatively analyzed immunostained metaphase chromosomes and ChIP-seq of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, which revealed a chromatin basis for biased homoeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion in polyploids. We examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D chromosomes, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s between the two subgenomes. However, intensities per chromosomal area were nearly twice as high in the D homeologs as in the A homeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed that more D homeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A homeologs with biased modifications correlated with the greater number of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homeologous chromosome pairs. Two chromosomes displayed different expression levels compared with other chromosomes, which correlate with known translocations and may affect the local chromatin structure and expression levels for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved. This example of genome-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homeologous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species, including many important crops.</p>

Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic variation onto <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic trait variation. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> effects with patterns of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic trait co-variation. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from mutational pleiotropic variation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic co-variation, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP map of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP map match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main effects of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Roles of Mutation, Selection, and Expression in Determining Relative Rates of Evolution in Mitochondrial versus Nuclear Genomes
<p>Eukaryotes rely on proteins encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial (mt) genomes, which interact within multisubunit complexes such as oxidative-phosphorylation enzymes. Although selection is thought to be less efficient on the asexual mt genome, in bilaterian animals the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (<i>ω</i>) is lower in mt- compared with nuclear-encoded OXPHOS subunits, suggesting <i>stronger</i> effects of purifying selection in the mt genome. Because high levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion constrain protein sequence evolution, one proposed resolution to this paradox is that mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s are expressed more highly than nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. To test this hypothesis, we investigated expression and sequence evolution of mt and nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s from 84 diverse eukaryotes that vary in mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> content and mutation rate. We found that the relationship between mt and nuclear <i>ω</i> values varied dramatically across eukaryotes. In contrast, transcript abundance is consistently higher for mt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s than nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, regardless of which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s happen to be in the mt genome. Consequently, expression levels cannot be responsible for the differences in <i>ω</i>. Rather, 84% of the variance in the ratio of <i>ω</i> values between mt and nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s could be explained by differences in mutation rate between the two genomes. We relate these findings to the hypothesis that high rates of mt mutation select for compensatory changes in the nuclear genome. We also propose an explanation for why mt transcripts consistently outnumber their nuclear counterparts, with implications for mitonuclear protein imbalance and aging.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Absence of strong strain effects in behavioral analyses of <i>Shank3</i>-deficient mice
<p>Haploinsufficiency of <i>SHANK3</i>, caused by chromosomal abnormalities or mutations that disrupt one copy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, leads to a neurodevelopmental syndrome called Phelan-McDermid syndrome, symptoms of which can include absent or delayed speech, intellectual disability, neurological changes and autism spectrum disorders. The SHANK3 protein forms a key structural part of the post-synaptic density. We previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rated and characterized mice with a targeted disruption of <i>Shank3</i> in which exons coding for the ankyrin-repeat domain were deleted and expression of full-length Shank3 was disrupted. We documented specific deficits in synaptic function and plasticity, along with reduced reciprocal social interactions, in <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous mice. Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e owing to a mutation at a single locus are quite frequently modulated by other loci, most dramatically when the entire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic background is changed. In mice, each strain of laboratory mouse represents a distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic background and alterations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e owing to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> knockout or trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis are frequently different across strains, which can lead to the identification of important modifier loci. We have investigated the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic background on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es of <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous, knockout and wild-type mice, using C57BL/6, 129SVE and FVB/Ntac strain backgrounds. We focused on observable behaviors with the goal of carrying out subsequent analyses to identify modifier loci. Surprisingly, there were very modest strain effects over a large battery of analyses. These results indicate that behavioral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es associated with <i>Shank3</i> haploinsufficiency are largely strain-independent.</p>

The tissue-specific transcriptomic landscape of the mid-gestational mouse embryo
<p>Differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion is a prerequisite for the formation of multiple cell types from the fertilized egg during embryo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis. Understanding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulatory networks controlling cellular differentiation requires the identification of crucial differentially expressed control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and, ideally, the determination of the complete transcriptomes of each individual cell type. Here, we have analyzed the transcriptomes of six major tissues dissected from mid-gestational (TS12) mouse embryos. Approximately one billion reads derived by RNA-seq analysis provided extended transcript lengths, novel first exons and alternative transcripts of known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s. We have identified 1375 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s showing tissue-specific expression, providing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> signatures for each of the six tissues. In addition, we have identified 1403 novel putative long noncoding RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> loci, 439 of which show differential expression. Our analysis provides the first complete transcriptome data for the mouse embryo. It offers a rich data source for the analysis of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> regulatory networks controlling mid-gestational development.</p>

Genetics, Lifestyle, and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol in Young and Apparently Healthy Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atherosclerosis starts in childhood but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a causal risk factor, is mostly studied and dealt with when clinical events have occurred. Women are usually affected later in life than men and are underdiagnosed, undertreated, and understudied in cardiovascular trials and research. This study aims at a better understanding of lifestyle and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic factors that affect LDL-C in young women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We randomly selected for every year of age 8 women with LDL-C ≤1st percentile (≤50 mg/dL) and 8 women with LDL-C ≥99th percentile (≥186 mg/dL) from 28 000 female participants aged between 25 to 40 years of a population-based cohort study. The resulting groups include 119 and 121 women, respectively, of an average 33 years of age. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-sequencing panel was used to assess established monogenic and polygenic origins of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es. Information on lifestyle was extracted from questionnaires. A healthy lifestyle score was allocated based on a recently developed algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the women with LDL-C ≤1st percentile, 19 (15.7%) carried mutations that are causing monogenic hypocholesterolemia and 60 (49.6%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tically predisposed to low LDL-C on the basis of an extremely low weighted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic risk score. In comparison with control groups, a healthier lifestyle was not associated with low LDL-C in women without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic predispositions. Among women with LDL-C ≥99th percentile, 20 women (16.8%) carried mutations that cause familial hypercholesterolemia, whereas 25 (21%) were predisposed to high LDL-C on the basis of a high-weighted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic risk score.

Female Mice With an XY Sex Chromosome Complement Develop Severe Angiotensin II–Induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a deadly pathology with strong sexual dimorphism. Similar to humans, female mice exhibit far lower incidences of angiotensin II–induced AAAs than males. In addition to sex hormones, the X and Y sex chromosomes, and their unique complements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, may contribute to sexually dimorphic AAA pathology. Here, we defined the effect of female (XX) versus male (XY) sex chromosome complement on angiotensin II–induced AAA formation and rupture in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ically female mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Female low-density lipoprotein receptor (<i>Ldlr</i>) deficient mice with an XX or XY sex chromosome complement were infused with angiotensin II for 28 days to induce AAAs. Abdominal aortic lumen diameters were quantified by ultrasound, whereas AAA diameters were quantified at study end point. DNA microarrays were performed on abdominal aortas. To mimic males, female mice were administered a single dose of testosterone as neonates or as adults before angiotensin II infusions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Female <i>Ldlr</i><sup>–/–</sup> deficient mice with an XX and XY sex chromosome complement had similar sex organ weights and low serum testosterone concentrations. Abdominal aortas from female XY mice selectively expressed Y chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s known to escape X inactivation were higher in XX females. The majority of aortic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> differences in XY versus XX females fell within inflammatory pathways. AAA incidences doubled and aneurysms ruptured in XY females. AAAs from XY females exhibited inflammation, and plasma interleukin-1β concentrations were increased in XY females. Moreover, aortas from XY females had augmented matrix metalloproteinase activity and increased oxidative stress. Last, testosterone exposure applied chronically, or as a single bolus at postnatal day 1, markedly worsened AAA outcomes in XY in comparison with XX adult females.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>An XY sex chromosome complement in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>ic females profoundly influenced aortic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> express</span></strong>ion profiles and promoted AAA severity. When XY females were exposed to testosterone, aneurysm rupture rates were striking. Mechanisms for augmented AAA severity in XY females include increased inflammation, augmented matrix metalloproteineases, and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s on the sex chromosomes regulate aortic vascular biology and contribute to sexual dimorphism of AAAs.

Genetic studies in <i>Drosophila</i> and humans support a model for the concerted function of <i>CISD2</i>, <i>PPT1</i> and <i>CLN3</i> in disease
<p>Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a progressive neurode<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>rative disease characterized by diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness. WFS1 and WFS2 are caused by recessive mutations in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s <i>Wolfram Syndrome 1</i> (<i>WFS1</i>) and <i>CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2</i> (<i>CISD2</i>), respectively. To explore the function of <i>CISD2</i>, we performed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic studies in flies with altered expression of its <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue, <i>cisd2</i>. Surprisingly, flies with strong ubiquitous RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>cisd2</i> had no obvious signs of altered life span, stress resistance, locomotor behavior or several other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es. We subsequently found in a targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic screen, however, that altered function of <i>cisd2</i> modified the effects of overexpressing the fly orthologues of two lysosomal storage disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, <i>palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1</i> (<i>PPT1</i> in humans, <i>Ppt1</i> in flies) and <i>ceroid-lipofuscinosis</i>, <i>neuronal 3</i> (<i>CLN3</i> in humans, <i>cln3</i> in flies), on eye morphology in flies. We also found that <i>cln3</i> modified the effects of overexpressing <i>Ppt1</i> in the eye and that overexpression of <i>cln3</i> interacted with a loss of function mutation in <i>cisd2</i> to disrupt locomotor ability in flies. Follow-up multi-species bioinformatic analyses suggested that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> network centered on <i>CISD2</i>, <i>PPT1</i> and <i>CLN3</i> might impact disease through altered carbohydrate metabolism, protein folding and endopeptidase activity. Human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic studies indicated that copy number variants (duplications and deletions) including <i>CLN3</i>, and possibly another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> in the <i>CISD2/PPT1/CLN3</i> network, are over-represented in individuals with developmental delay. Our studies indicate that <i>cisd2</i>, <i>Ppt1</i> and <i>cln3</i> function in concert in flies, suggesting that <i>CISD2</i>, <i>PPT1</i> and <i>CLN3</i> might also function coordinately in humans. Further, our studies raise the possibility that WFS2 and some lysosomal storage disorders might be influenced by common mechanisms and that the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s might have previously unappreciated effects on developmental delay.</p>

An Improved <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS
<p>Virus-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing (VIGS) is used extensively for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with silencing conducted through stable transformation, but many virus-silencing vectors, especially in grasses, induce only transient silencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es. A major reason for transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es is the instability of the foreign <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> fragment (insert) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the development of a <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> (BMV)-based vector that better maintains inserts through modification of the original BMV vector RNA sequence. Modification of the BMV RNA3 sequence yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained <i>phytoene desaturase</i> and <i>heat shock protein70-1</i> (<i>HSP70-1</i>) inserts in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Longer maintenance of inserts was correlated with greater target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> silencing and more extensive visible silencing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>es displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more leaves. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in <i>N. benthamiana</i> after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of virus in this intermediate host used to produce virus inoculum for grass hosts. For <i>HSP70</i>, silencing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> knockdown and not a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>ral effect of virus infection. The cause of the increased insert stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in grasses, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.</p>

Light and Plastid Signals Regulate Different Sets of Genes in the Albino Mutant Pap7-1
<p>Plants possessing dysfunctional plastids due to defects in pigment biosynthesis or translation are known to repress photosynthesis-associated nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s via retrograde signals from the disturbed organelles toward the nucleus. These signals are thought to be essential for proper bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis and function of the plastid. Mutants lacking plastid-encoded RNA polymerase-associated proteins (PAPs) display a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic arrest in eoplast-chloroplast transition leading to an albino <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e in the light. Retrograde signaling in these mutants, therefore, could be expected to be similar as under conditions inducing plastid dysfunction. To answer this question, we performed plastome- and genomewide array analyses in the <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutant of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In parallel, we determined the potential overlap with light-regulated expression networks. To this end, we performed a comparative expression profiling approach using light- and dark-grown wild-type plants as relative control for the expression profiles obtained from light-grown <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants. Our data indicate a specific impact of retrograde signals on metabolism-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s in <i>pap7</i>-<i>1</i> mutants reflecting the starvation situation of the albino seedlings. In contrast, light regulation of PhANGs and other nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> groups appears to be fully functional in this mutant, indicating that a block in chloroplast bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>sis per se does not repress expression of them as suggested by earlier studies. Only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s for light harvesting complex proteins displayed a significant repression indicating an exclusive retrograde impact on this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> family. Our results indicate that chloroplasts and arrested plastids each emit specific signals that control different target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> modules both in positive and negative manner.</p>

Cytological and Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Important Roles of <i>CLE19</i> in Pollen Exine Formation
<p>The CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE) peptide signals are required for cell-cell communication in several plant growth and developmental processes. However, little is known regarding the possible functions of the CLEs in the anther. Here, we show that a T-DNA insertional mutant, and dominant-negative (DN) and overexpression (OX) transgenic plants of the <i>CLE19</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>, exhibited significantly reduced anther size and pollen grain number and abnormal pollen wall formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Interestingly, the <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i> pollen grains showed a more extensively covered surface, but <i>CLE19-OX</i> pollen exine exhibited clearly missing connections in the network and lacked separation between areas that normally form the lacunae. With a combination of cell biological, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>tic, and transcriptomic analyses on <i>cle19</i>, <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i>, and <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants, we demonstrated that <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants produced highly vacuolated and swollen <i>aborted microspores</i> (<i>ams</i>)-like tapetal cells, lacked lipidic tapetosomes and elaioplasts, and had abnormal pollen primexine without obvious accumulation of sporopollenin precursors. Moreover, <i>CLE19</i> is important for the normal expression of more than 1,000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, including the transcription factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> <i>AMS</i>, 280 <i>AMS</i>-downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s, and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>s involved in pollen coat and pollen exine formation, lipid metabolism, pollen germination, and hormone metabolism. In addition, the <i>DN-CLE19(+/+) ams(−/−)</i> plants exhibited the <i>ams</i> anther <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenotyp</span></strong>e and <i>ams(+/−)</i> partially suppressed the <i>DN-CLE19</i> trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong>-induced pollen exine defects. These findings demonstrate that the proper amount of CLE19 signal is essential for the normal expression of <i>AMS</i> and its downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gene</span></strong> networks in the regulation of anther development and pollen exine formation.</p>

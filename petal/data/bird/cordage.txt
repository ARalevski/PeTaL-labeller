Low Water Potential and At14a-Like1 (AFL1) Effects on Endocytosis and Actin Filament Organization
<p>At14a-Like1 (AFL1) is a stress-induced protein of unknown function that promotes growth during low water potential stress and drought. Previous analysis indicated that AFL1 may have functions related to endocytosis and regulation of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> organization, processes for which the effects of low water potential are little known. We found that low water potential led to a decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the membrane-impermeable dye FM4-64. Ectopic expression of AFL1 reversed the decrease in FM4-64 uptake seen in wild type, while reduced AFL1 expression led to further inhibition of FM4-64 uptake. Increased AFL1 also made FM4-64 uptake less sensitive to the actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> disruptor Latrunculin B (LatB). LatB decreased AFL1-Clathrin Light Chain colocalization, further indicating that effects of AFL1 on endocytosis may be related to actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> organization or stability. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic AFL1 expression made actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s less sensitive to disruption by LatB or Cytochalasin D and led to increased actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> skewness and decreased occupancy, indicative of more bundled actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s. This latter effect could be partially mimicked by the actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> stabilizer Jasplakinolide (JASP). However, AFL1 did not substantially inhibit actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> dynamics, indicating that AFL1 acts via a different mechanism than JASP-induced stabilization. AFL1 partially colocalized with actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s but not with microtubules, further indicating actin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>–related function of AFL1. These data provide insight into endocytosis and actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> responses to low water potential stress and demonstrate an involvement of AFL1 in these key cellular processes.</p>

High-Fiber Diet and Acetate Supplementation Change the Gut Microbiota and Prevent the Development of Hypertension and Heart Failure in Hypertensive Mice
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Dietary intake of fruit and vegetables is associated with lower incidence of hypertension, but the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Here, we evaluated the effect of a high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> diet and supplementation with the short-chain fatty acid acetate on the gut microbiota and the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Gut microbiome, cardiorenal structure/function, and blood pressure were examined in sham and mineralocorticoid excess–treated mice with a control diet, high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> diet, or acetate supplementation. We also determined the renal and cardiac transcriptome of mice treated with the different diets.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that high consumption of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> modified the gut microbiota populations and increased the abundance of acetate-producing bacteria independently of mineralocorticoid excess. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> and acetate decreased gut dysbiosis, measured by the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, and increased the prevalence of <i>Bacteroides acidifaciens</i>. Compared with mineralocorticoid-excess mice fed a control diet, both high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> diet and acetate supplementation significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures, cardiac fibrosis, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Acetate had similar effects and markedly reduced renal fibrosis. Transcriptome analyses showed that the protective effects of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> and acetate were accompanied by the downregulation of cardiac and renal <i>Egr1</i>, a master cardiovascular regulator involved in cardiac hypertrophy, cardiorenal fibrosis, and inflammation. We also observed the upregulation of a network of genes involved in circadian rhythm in both tissues and downregulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in the heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A diet high in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> led to changes in the gut microbiota that played a protective role in the development of cardiovascular disease. The favorable effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> may be explained by the generation and distribution of one of the main metabolites of the gut microbiota, the short-chain fatty acid acetate.

A mechanism for preventing asymmetric histone segregation onto replicating DNA strands
<p>How parental histone (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramers, the primary carriers of epigenetic modifications, are transferred onto leading and lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s of DNA replication forks for epigenetic inheritance remains elusive. Here we show that parental (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramers are assembled into nucleosomes onto both leading and lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s, with a slight preference for lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s. The lagging-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> preference increases markedly in budding yeast cells lacking Dpb3 and Dpb4, two subunits of the leading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> DNA polymerase, Pol ε, owing to the impairment of parental (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> transfer to leading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s. Dpb3-Dpb4 binds H3-H4 in vitro and participates in the inheritance of heterochromatin. These results indicate that different proteins facilitate the transfer of parental (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> onto leading versus lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s and that Dbp3-Dpb4 plays an important role in this poorly understood process.</p>

Biological fabrication of cellulose fibers with tailored properties
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> is a promising basis for wearable smart textiles. Current approaches that rely on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> coatings suffer from function loss during wear. We present an approach that allows biological incorporation of exogenous molecules into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s to tailor the material’s functionality. In vitro model cultures of upland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) are incubated with 6-carboxyfluorescein–glucose and dysprosium–1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid–glucose, where the glucose moiety acts as a carrier capable of traveling from the vascular connection to the outermost cell layer of the ovule epidermis, becoming incorporated into the cellulose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s. This yields <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s with unnatural properties such as fluorescence or magnetism. Combining biological systems with the appropriate molecular design offers numerous possibilities to grow functional composite materials and implements a material-farming concept.</p>

Satellite cell activation and populations on single muscle-fiber cultures from adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)
<p>Satellite cells (SCs), stem cells in skeletal muscle, are mitotically quiescent in adult mammals until activated for growth or regeneration. In mouse muscle, SCs are activated by nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the mechanically induced NO–HGF signaling cascade. Here, the SC population on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s from the adult, ectothermic zebrafish and SC responsiveness to activating stimuli were assessed using the model system of isolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s cultured at 27 and 21°C. SCs were identified by immunostaining for the HGF receptor, c-met, and activation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine uptake in culture or <i>in vivo</i>. In dose–response studies, SC activation was increased by treatment with the NO-donor drug isosorbide dinitrate (1 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) or HGF (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) to maximum activation at lower concentrations of both than in previous studies of mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s. HGF-induced activation was blocked by anti-c-met antibody, and reduced by culture at 21°C. The effect of cyclical stretch (3 h at 4 cycles per minute) increased activation and was blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibition and reduced by culture at 21°C. The number of c-met+ SCs per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> increased rapidly (by 3 h) after stretching. The character of signaling in SC activation on zebrafish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s, in particular temperature-dependent responses to HGF and stretch, gives new insights into the influence of ectothermy on regulation of muscle growth in teleosts and suggests the use of the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> model system to explore the basis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> hyperplasia and the conservation of regulatory pathways between species.</p>

Structures and operating principles of the replisome
<p>Visualization in atomic detail of the replisome that performs concerted leading– and lagging–DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> synthesis at a replication fork has not been reported. Using bacteriophage T7 as a model system, we determined cryo–electron microscopy structures up to 3.2-angstroms resolution of helicase translocating along DNA and of helicase-polymerase-primase complexes engaging in synthesis of both DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s. Each domain of the spiral-shaped hexameric helicase translocates sequentially hand-over-hand along a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA coil, akin to the way AAA+ ATPases (adenosine triphosphatases) unfold peptides. Two lagging-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> polymerases are attached to the primase, ready for Okazaki fragment synthesis in tandem. A β hairpin from the leading-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> polymerase separates two parental DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s into a T-shaped fork, thus enabling the closely coupled helicase to advance perpendicular to the downstream DNA duplex. These structures reveal the molecular organization and operating principles of a replisome.</p>

Conserved Dynamics of Chloroplast Cytoskeletal FtsZ Proteins Across Photosynthetic Lineages
<p>The cytoskeletal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>ing temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) ring is critical for cell division in bacteria and chloroplast division in photosynthetic eukaryotes. While bacterial FtsZ rings are composed of a single FtsZ, except in the basal glaucophytes, chloroplast division involves two heteropolymer-forming FtsZ isoforms: FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 in the green lineage and FtsZA and FtsZB in red algae. FtsZ1 and FtsZB probably arose by duplication of the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively. We expressed fluorescent fusions of FtsZ from diverse photosynthetic organisms in a heterologous system to compare their intrinsic assembly and dynamic properties. FtsZ2 and FtsZA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s were morphologically distinct from FtsZ1 and FtsZB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s. When coexpressed, FtsZ pairs from plants and algae colocalized, consistent with heteropolymerization. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that subunit exchange was greater from FtsZ1 and FtsZB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s than from FtsZ2 and FtsZA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s and that FtsZ1 and FtsZB increased turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively, from heteropolymers. GTPase activity was essential only for turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s. Cyanobacterial and glaucophyte FtsZ properties mostly resembled those of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, though the glaucophyte protein exhibited some hybrid features. Our results demonstrate that the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA have retained functional attributes of their common FtsZ ancestor, while eukaryotic-specific FtsZ1 and FtsZB acquired new but similar dynamic properties, possibly through convergent evolution. Our findings suggest that the evolution of a second FtsZ that could copolymerize with the more ancestral form to enhance FtsZ-ring dynamics may have been essential for plastid evolution in the green and red photosynthetic lineages.</p>

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p>Water storage is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant water balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to water storage can be derived from rehydration and water-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with water, water uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high water storage capacitance was associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and water storage. In contrast, refilling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that storage compartments for capillary water refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain storage compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s play a substantial role in daily discharge/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

De novo design of self-assembling helical protein filaments

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> building blocks are idealized repeat proteins, and thus the diameter of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s can be systematically tuned by varying the number of repeat units. The assembly and disassembly of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s can be controlled by engineered anchor and capping units built from monomers lacking one of the interaction surfaces.

Tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices pinch collagen fibers to support 3D cell migration
<p>Migrating cells often use focal adhesions in order to move. Focal adhesions are less prominent in cells migrating in three-dimensional (3D) as compared with 2D environments. We looked for alternative adhesion structures supporting cell migration. We analyzed the dynamics of clathrin-coated pits in cells migrating in a 3D environment of collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s. Both topological cues and local engagement of integrins triggered the accumulation of clathrin-coated structures on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s. Clathrin/adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) lattices pinched collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s by adopting a tube-like morphology and regulated adhesion to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s in an endocytosis-independent manner. During migration, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices stabilized cellular protrusions by providing anchoring points to collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s. Thus, tubular clathrin/AP-2 lattices promote cell adhesion that, in coordination with focal adhesions, supports cell migration in 3D.</p>

Recursive Paleohexaploidization Shaped the Durian Genome
<p>The durian (<i>Durio zibethinus</i>) genome has recently become available, and analysis of this genome reveals two paleopolyploidization events previously inferred as shared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> (<i>Gossypium</i> spp.). Here, we reanalyzed the durian genome in comparison with other well-characterized genomes. We found that durian and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> were actually affected by different polyploidization events: hexaploidization in durian ∼19–21 million years ago (mya) and decaploidization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> ∼13–14 mya. Previous interpretations of shared polyploidization events may have resulted from the elevated evolutionary rates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> genes due to the decaploidization and insufficient consideration of the complexity of plant genomes. The decaploidization elevated evolutionary rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> genes by ∼64% compared to durian and explained a previous ∼4-fold over dating of the event. In contrast, the hexaploidization in durian did not prominently elevate gene evolutionary rates, likely due to its long generation time. Moreover, divergent evolutionary rates probably explain 98.4% of reconstructed phylogenetic trees of homologous genes being incongruent with expected topology. The findings provide further insight into the roles played by polypoidization in the evolution of genomes and genes, and they suggest revisiting existing reconstructed phylogenetic trees.</p>

Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The porosity of wood cell walls is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood materials perspective. The movement of water in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous networks formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and open conduits created by vessels and perforation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, water can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> cell walls; however, these micropore networks are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the distribution of micropores in the secondary walls and middle lamellae of tracheids and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s in relation to cell wall composition. Using two different types of probe, we identified a greater porosity of secondary cell walls and a reduced porosity of the middle lamella. Areas of reduced porosity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell wall of both tracheids and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s that appear unrelated to lignification or the distribution of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> cell walls were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to porosity probes. Vessel cell walls were comparable to those of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s in terms of both porosity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell wall porosity in xylem. The highly lignified middle lamella, and lumen surface, act as a barrier to probe movement and, therefore, water movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

Laccase GhLac1 Modulates Broad-Spectrum Biotic Stress Tolerance via Manipulating Phenylpropanoid Pathway and Jasmonic Acid Synthesis
<p>Plants are constantly challenged by a multitude of pathogens and pests, which causes massive yield and quality losses annually. A promising approach to reduce such losses is to enhance the immune system of plants through genetic engineering. Previous work has shown that laccases (p-diphenol:dioxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.2) function as lignin polymerization enzymes. Here we demonstrate that transgenic manipulation of the expression of the laccase gene <i>GhLac1</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) can confer an enhanced defense response to both pathogens and pests. Overexpression of <i>GhLac1</i> leads to increased lignification, associated with increased tolerance to the fungal pathogen <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> and to the insect pests <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> bollworm (<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> aphid (<i>Aphis gosypii</i>). Suppression of <i>GhLac1</i> expression leads to a redirection of metabolic flux in the phenylpropanoid pathway, causing the accumulation of JA and secondary metabolites that confer resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> bollworm; it also leads to increased susceptibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> aphid. Plant laccases therefore provide a new molecular tool to engineer pest and pathogen resistance in crops.</p>

Defining the Diverse Cell Populations Contributing to Lignification in Arabidopsis Stems<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Many land plants evolved tall and sturdy growth habits due to specialized cells with thick lignified cell walls: tracheary elements that function in water transport and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s that function in structural support. The objective of this study was to define how and when diverse cell populations contribute lignin precursors, monolignols, to secondary cell walls during lignification of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) inflorescence stem. Previous work demonstrated that, when lignin biosynthesis is suppressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> and tracheary element cells with thickened walls, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s become lignin-depleted while vascular bundles still lignify, suggesting that nonlignifying neighboring xylem cells are contributing to lignification. In this work, we dissect the contributions of different cell types, specifically xylary parenchyma and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> cells, to lignification of the stem using cell-type-specific promoters to either knock down an essential monolignol biosynthetic gene or to introduce novel monolignol conjugates. Analysis of either reductions in lignin in knockdown lines, or the addition of novel monolignol conjugates, directly identifies the xylary parenchyma and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> cell populations that contribute to the stem lignification and the developmental timing at which each contribution is most important.</p>

The Receptor-Like Kinase AtVRLK1 Regulates Secondary Cell Wall Thickening
<p>During the growth and development of land plants, some specialized cells, such as tracheary elements, undergo secondary cell wall thickening. Secondary cell walls contain additional lignin, compared with primary cell walls, thus providing mechanical strength and potentially improving defenses against pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms that initiate wall thickening are unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, encoded by <i>AtVRLK1</i> (<i>Vascular-Related Receptor-Like Kinase1</i>), that is expressed specifically in cells undergoing secondary cell wall thickening. Suppression of <i>AtVRLK1</i> expression resulted in a range of phenotypes that included retarded early elongation of the inflorescence stem, shorter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s, slower root growth, and shorter flower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s. In contrast, up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> led to longer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> cells, reduced secondary cell wall thickening in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> and vessel cells, and defects in anther dehiscence. Molecular and cellular analyses showed that down-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> promoted secondary cell wall thickening and up-regulation of <i>AtVRLK1</i> enhanced cell elongation and inhibited secondary cell wall thickening. We propose that AtVRLK1 functions as a signaling component in coordinating cell elongation and cell wall thickening during growth and development.</p>

ALY RNA-Binding Proteins Are Required for Nucleocytosolic mRNA Transport and Modulate Plant Growth and Development
<p>The regulated transport of mRNAs from the cell nucleus to the cytosol is a critical step linking transcript synthesis and processing with translation. However, in plants, only a few of the factors that act in the mRNA export pathway have been functionally characterized. Flowering plant genomes encode several members of the ALY protein family, which function as mRNA export factors in other organisms. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ALY1 to ALY4 are commonly detected in root and leaf cells, but they are differentially expressed in reproductive tissue. Moreover, the subnuclear distribution of ALY1/2 differs from that of ALY3/4. ALY1 binds with higher affinity to single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed RNA than double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed RNA and single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA and interacts preferentially with 5-methylcytosine-modified single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed RNA. Compared with the full-length protein, the individual RNA recognition motif of ALY1 binds RNA only weakly. ALY proteins interact with the RNA helicase UAP56, indicating a link to the mRNA export machinery. Consistently, ALY1 complements the lethal phenotype of yeast cells lacking the ALY1 ortholog Yra1. Whereas individual <i>aly</i> mutants have a wild-type appearance, disruption of <i>ALY1</i> to <i>ALY4</i> in <i>4xaly</i> plants causes vegetative and reproductive defects, including strongly reduced growth, altered flower morphology, as well as abnormal ovules and female gametophytes, causing reduced seed production. Moreover, polyadenylated mRNAs accumulate in the nuclei of <i>4xaly</i> cells. Our results highlight the requirement of efficient mRNA nucleocytosolic transport for proper plant growth and development and indicate that ALY1 to ALY4 act partly redundantly in this process; however, differences in expression and subnuclear localization suggest distinct functions.</p>

A Comprehensively Curated Genome-Scale Two-Cell Model for the Heterocystous Cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120
<p><i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 is a nitrogen-fixing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>ous cyanobacterium. Under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a fraction of the vegetative cells in each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> terminally differentiate to nongrowing heterocysts. Heterocysts are metabolically and structurally specialized to enable O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive nitrogen fixation. The functionality of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>, as an association of vegetative cells and heterocysts, is postulated to depend on metabolic exchange of electrons, carbon, and fixed nitrogen. In this study, we compile and evaluate a comprehensive curated stoichiometric model of this two-cell system, with the objective function based on the growth of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong> under diazotrophic conditions. The predicted growth rate under nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, as well as the effect of external carbon and nitrogen sources, was thereafter verified. Furthermore, the model was utilized to comprehensively evaluate the optimality of putative metabolic exchange reactions between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The model suggested that optimal growth requires at least four exchange metabolites.

Dynamic gating of infrared radiation in a textile
<p>The human body absorbs and loses heat largely through infrared radiation centering around a wavelength of 10 micrometers. However, neither our skin nor the textiles that make up clothing are capable of dynamically controlling this optical channel for thermal management. By coating triacetate-cellulose bimorph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s with a thin layer of carbon nanotubes, we effectively modulated the infrared radiation by more than 35% as the relative humidity of the underlying skin changed. Both experiments and modeling suggest that this dynamic infrared gating effect mainly arises from distance-dependent electromagnetic coupling between neighboring coated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s in the textile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yarn</span></strong>s. This effect opens a pathway for developing wearable localized thermal management systems that are autonomous and self-powered, as well as expanding our ability to adapt to demanding environments.</p>

Functionally diverse type V CRISPR-Cas systems
<p>Type V CRISPR-Cas systems are distinguished by a single RNA-guided RuvC domain-containing effector, Cas12. Although effectors of subtypes V-A (Cas12a) and V-B (Cas12b) have been studied in detail, the distinct domain architectures and diverged RuvC sequences of uncharacterized Cas12 proteins suggest unexplored functional diversity. Here, we identify and characterize Cas12c, -g, -h, and -i. Cas12c, -h, and -i demonstrate RNA-guided double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA (dsDNA) interference activity. Cas12i exhibits markedly different efficiencies of CRISPR RNA spacer complementary and noncomplementary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> cleavage resulting in predominant dsDNA nicking. Cas12g is an RNA-guided ribonuclease (RNase) with collateral RNase and single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> DNase activities. Our study reveals the functional diversity emerging along different routes of type V CRISPR-Cas evolution and expands the CRISPR toolbox.</p>

Observation of the topological Anderson insulator in disordered atomic wires
<p>Topology and disorder have a rich combined influence on quantum transport. To probe their interplay, we synthesized one-dimensional chiral symmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wire</span></strong>s with controllable disorder via spectroscopic Hamiltonian engineering, based on the laser-driven coupling of discrete momentum states of ultracold atoms. Measuring the bulk evolution of a topological indicator after a sudden quench, we observed the topological Anderson insulator phase, in which added disorder drives the band structure of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wire</span></strong> from topologically trivial to nontrivial. In addition, we observed the robustness of topologically nontrivial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wire</span></strong>s to weak disorder and measured the transition to a trivial phase in the presence of strong disorder. Atomic interactions in this quantum simulation platform may enable realizations of strongly interacting topological fluids.</p>

MCM2 promotes symmetric inheritance of modified histones during DNA replication
<p>During genome replication, parental histones are recycled to newly replicated DNA with their posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Whether sister chromatids inherit modified histones evenly remains unknown. We measured histone PTM partition to sister chromatids in embryonic stem cells. We found that parental histones H3-H4 segregate to both daughter DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s with a weak leading-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> bias, skewing partition at topologically associating domain (TAD) borders and enhancers proximal to replication initiation zones. Segregation of parental histones to the leading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> increased markedly in cells with histone-binding mutations in MCM2, part of the replicative helicase, exacerbating histone PTM sister chromatid asymmetry. This work reveals how histones are inherited to sister chromatids and identifies a mechanism by which the replication machinery ensures symmetric cell division.</p>

Ribonucleotide incorporation enables repair of chromosome breaks by nonhomologous end joining
<p>The nonhomologous end–joining (NHEJ) pathway preserves genome stability by ligating the ends of broken chromosomes together. It employs end-processing enzymes, including polymerases, to prepare ends for ligation. We show that two such polymerases incorporate primarily ribonucleotides during NHEJ—an exception to the central dogma of molecular biology—both during repair of chromosome breaks made by Cas9 and during V(D)J recombination. Moreover, additions of ribonucleotides but not deoxynucleotides effectively promote ligation. Repair kinetics suggest that ribonucleotide-dependent first-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> ligation is followed by complementary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> repair with deoxynucleotides, then by replacement of ribonucleotides embedded in the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> with deoxynucleotides. Our results indicate that as much as 65% of cellular NHEJ products have transiently embedded ribonucleotides, which promote flexibility in repair at the cost of more fragile intermediates.</p>

Ultrastable laser interferometry for earthquake detection with terrestrial and submarine cables

Structure basis for RNA-guided DNA degradation by Cascade and Cas3
<p>Type I CRISPR-Cas system features a sequential target-searching and degradation process on double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA by the RNA-guided Cascade (CRISPR associated complex for antiviral defense) complex and the nuclease-helicase fusion enzyme Cas3, respectively. Here, we present a 3.7-angstrom-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Type I-E Cascade/R-loop/Cas3 complex, poised to initiate DNA degradation. Cas3 distinguishes Cascade conformations and only captures the R-loop–forming Cascade, to avoid cleaving partially complementary targets. Its nuclease domain recruits the nontarget <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> (NTS) DNA at a bulged region for the nicking of single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA. An additional 4.7-angstrom-resolution cryo-EM structure captures the postnicking state, in which the severed NTS retracts to the helicase entrance, to be threaded for adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent processive degradation. These snapshots form the basis for understanding RNA-guided DNA degradation in Type I-E CRISPR-Cas systems.</p>

CRISPR-Cas12a target binding unleashes indiscriminate single-stranded DNase activity
<p>CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) proteins are RNA-guided enzymes that bind and cut DNA as components of bacterial adaptive immune systems. Like CRISPR-Cas9, Cas12a has been harnessed for genome editing on the basis of its ability to generate targeted, double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA breaks. Here we show that RNA-guided DNA binding unleashes indiscriminate single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA (ssDNA) cleavage activity by Cas12a that completely degrades ssDNA molecules. We find that target-activated, nonspecific single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed deoxyribonuclease (ssDNase) cleavage is also a property of other type V CRISPR-Cas12 enzymes. By combining Cas12a ssDNase activation with isothermal amplification, we create a method termed DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR), which achieves attomolar sensitivity for DNA detection. DETECTR enables rapid and specific detection of human papillomavirus in patient samples, thereby providing a simple platform for molecular diagnostics.</p>

Single-stranded DNA and RNA origami
<p>Self-folding of an information-carrying polymer into a defined structure is foundational to biology and offers attractive potential as a synthetic strategy.

We describe a framework to design and synthesize a single DNA or RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> to self-fold into a complex yet unknotted structure that approximates an arbitrary user-prescribed shape. We experimentally construct diverse multikilobase single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed structures, including a ~10,000-nucleotide (nt) DNA structure and a ~6000-nt RNA structure.

RPA binds histone H3-H4 and functions in DNA replication–coupled nucleosome assembly
<p>DNA replication–coupled nucleosome assembly is essential to maintain genome integrity and retain epigenetic information. Multiple involved histone chaperones have been identified, but how nucleosome assembly is coupled to DNA replication remains elusive. Here we show that replication protein A (RPA), an essential replisome component that binds single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA, has a role in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. RPA directly binds free H3-H4. Assays using a synthetic sequence that mimics freshly unwound single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA at replication fork showed that RPA promotes DNA-(H3-H4) complex formation immediately adjacent to double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA. Further, an RPA mutant defective in H3-H4 binding exhibited attenuated nucleosome assembly on nascent chromatin. Thus, we propose that RPA functions as a platform for targeting histone deposition to replication fork, through which RPA couples nucleosome assembly with ongoing DNA replication.</p>

The Largest Subunit of DNA Polymerase Delta Is Required for Normal Formation of Meiotic Type I Crossovers
<p>Meiotic recombination contributes to the maintenance of the association between homologous chromosomes (homologs) and ensures the accurate segregation of homologs during anaphase I, thus facilitating the redistribution of alleles among progeny. Meiotic recombination is initiated by the programmed formation of DNA double <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> breaks, the repair of which requires DNA synthesis, but the role of DNA synthesis proteins during meiosis is largely unknown. Here, we hypothesized that the lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>-specific DNA Polymerase δ (POL δ) might be required for meiotic recombination, based on a previous analysis of DNA Replication Factor1 that suggested a role for lagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> synthesis in meiotic recombination. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), complete mutation of the catalytic subunit of POL δ, encoded by <i>AtPOLD1</i>, leads to embryo lethality. Therefore, we used a meiocyte-specific knockdown strategy to test this hypothesis. Reduced expression of <i>AtPOLD1</i> in meiocytes caused decreased fertility and meiotic defects, including incomplete synapsis, the formation of multivalents, chromosome fragmentation, and improper segregation. Analysis of meiotic crossover (CO) frequencies showed that <i>AtPOLD1<sup>RNAi</sup></i> plants had significantly fewer interference-sensitive COs than the wild type, indicating that AtPOL δ participates in type I CO formation. <i>AtPOLD1<sup>RNAi</sup> atpol2a</i> double mutant meiocytes displayed more severe meiotic phenotypes than those of either single mutant, suggesting that the function of AtPOLD1 and AtPOL2A is not identical in meiotic recombination. Given that POL δ is highly conserved among eukaryotes, we hypothesize that the described role of POL δ here in meiotic recombination likely exists widely in eukaryotes.</p>

ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptation, plant nuclei move centripetally toward the midplane of the leaf blade; thus, the nuclei on both the adaxial and abaxial sides become positioned at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear positioning implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. Here, we show that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) and ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear positioning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Two mutants defective in the positioning of nuclei in the dark were isolated and designated as <i>unusual nuclear positioning1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) and <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, nuclei of <i>unp1</i> were positioned at the anticlinal walls of adaxial and abaxial mesophyll cells and abaxial pavement cells, whereas the nuclei of <i>unp2</i> were positioned at the anticlinal walls of mesophyll and pavement cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a dominant-negative mutation in <i>ACTIN7</i>, and <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutation in <i>AN</i>. Actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s in <i>unp1</i> were fragmented and reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, and plant growth. The mutation in <i>AN</i> caused aberrant positioning of nuclei-associated actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s at the anticlinal walls. AN was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted physically with plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) and itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-propanone significantly inhibited dark-induced nuclear positioning. Collectively, these results suggest that the AN-DYRKP complex regulates the alignment of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s during centripetal nuclear positioning in leaf cells.</p>

A Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitor Enhances Resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> Wilt
<p>Pectins are major components of the primary plant cell wall, which functions as the primary barrier against pathogens. Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) catalyze the demethylesterification of the homogalacturonan domains of pectin in the plant cell wall. Their activity is regulated by PME inhibitors (PMEIs). Here, we provide evidence that the pectin methylesterase-inhibiting protein GhPMEI3 from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) functions in plant responses to infection by the fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>. GhPMEI3 interacts with PMEs and regulates the expression of a specific fungal polygalacturonase (VdPG1). Ectopic expression of GhPMEI3 increased pectin methyl esterification and limited fungal disease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong>, while also modulating root elongation. Enzymatic analyses revealed that GhPMEI3 efficiently inhibited the activity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> GhPME2/GhPME31. Experiments using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants expressing the <i>GhPMEI3</i> gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter revealed that GhPMEI3 inhibits the endogenous PME activity in vitro. Moreover, the enhanced resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> was associated with altered <i>VdPG1</i> expression. Virus-induced silencing of <i>GhPMEI3</i> resulted in increased susceptibility to <i>V. dahliae</i>. Further, we investigated the interaction between GhPMEI3 and GhPME2/GhPME31 using inhibition assays and molecular docking simulations. The peculiar structural features of GhPMEI3 were responsible for the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with GhPME2/GhPME31. Together, these results suggest that GhPMEI3 enhances resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt. Moreover, GhPMEI3-GhPMEs interactions would be needed before drawing the correlation between structure-function and are crucial for plant development against the ever-evolving fungal pathogens.</p>

Cold acclimation alters the connective tissue content of the zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) heart
<p>Thermal acclimation can alter cardiac function and morphology in a number of fish species, but little is known about the regulation of these changes. The purpose of the present study was to determine how cold acclimation affects zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) cardiac morphology, collagen composition and connective tissue regulation. Heart volume, the thickness of the compact myocardium, collagen content and collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> composition were compared between control (27°C) and cold-acclimated (20°C) zebrafish using serially sectioned hearts stained with Picrosirius Red. Collagen content and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> composition of the pericardial membrane were also examined. Cold acclimation did not affect the volume of the contracted heart; however, there was a significant decrease in the thickness of the compact myocardium. There was also a decrease in the collagen content of the compact myocardium and in the amount of thick collagen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s throughout the heart. Cold-acclimated zebrafish also increased expression of the gene transcript for matrix metalloproteinase 2, matrix metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and collagen Type I α1. We propose that the reduction in the thickness of the compact myocardium as well as the change in collagen content may help to maintain the compliance of the ventricle as temperatures decrease. Together, these results clearly demonstrate that the zebrafish heart undergoes significant remodeling in response to cold acclimation.</p>

The fraction of strongly bound cross-bridges is increased in mice that carry the myopathy-linked myosin heavy chain mutation MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>
<p>Myosinopathies have emerged as a new group of diseases and are caused by mutations in genes encoding myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. One major hallmark of these diseases is skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s from <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i> mice, which carry a mutation that provokes an L342Q change within the catalytic domain of the type IIb skeletal muscle myosin protein MYH4. Because homozygous animals develop rapid muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis, they must be killed by postnatal day 13, so all experiments were performed using skeletal muscles from adult heterozygous animals (<i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+). <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice contain MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup> expressed at 7% of the levels of the wild-type (WT) protein, and are overtly and histologically normal. However, mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s revealed, upon maximal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation, higher stiffness as well as altered meridional and equatorial reflections in <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ mice when compared with age-matched WT animals. Under rigor conditions, by contrast, no difference was observed between <i>Myh4<sup>arl</sup></i>/+ and WT mice. Altogether, these findings prove that, in adult <i>MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup></i> heterozygous mice, the transition from weak to strong myosin cross-bridge binding is facilitated, increasing the number of strongly attached myosin heads, thus enhancing force production. These changes are predictably exacerbated in the type IIb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s of homozygous mice, in which the embryonic myosin isoform is fully replaced by MYH4<sup>L342Q</sup>, leading to a hypercontraction, muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of skeletal myosinopathies.</p>

Functional and histopathological identification of the respiratory failure in a DMSXL transgenic mouse model of myotonic dystrophy
<p>Acute and chronic respiratory failure is one of the major and potentially life-threatening features in individuals with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Despite several clinical demonstrations showing respiratory problems in DM1 patients, the mechanisms are still not completely understood. This study was designed to investigate whether the DMSXL transgenic mouse model for DM1 exhibits respiratory disorders and, if so, to identify the pathological changes underlying these respiratory problems. Using pressure plethysmography, we assessed the breathing function in control mice and DMSXL mice generated after large expansions of the CTG repeat in successive generations of DM1 transgenic mice. Statistical analysis of breathing function measurements revealed a significant decrease in the most relevant respiratory parameters in DMSXL mice, indicating impaired respiratory function. Histological and morphometric analysis showed pathological changes in diaphragmatic muscle of DMSXL mice, characterized by an increase in the percentage of type I muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s, the presence of central nuclei, partial denervation of end-plates (EPs) and a significant reduction in their size, shape complexity and density of acetylcholine receptors, all of which reflect a possible breakdown in communication between the diaphragmatic muscles <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s and the nerve terminals. Diaphragm muscle abnormalities were accompanied by an accumulation of mutant DMPK RNA foci in muscle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> nuclei. Moreover, in DMSXL mice, the unmyelinated phrenic afferents are significantly lower. Also in these mice, significant neuronopathy was not detected in either cervical phrenic motor neurons or brainstem respiratory neurons. Because EPs are involved in the transmission of action potentials and the unmyelinated phrenic afferents exert a modulating influence on the respiratory drive, the pathological alterations affecting these structures might underlie the respiratory impairment detected in DMSXL mice. Understanding mechanisms of respiratory deficiency should guide pharmaceutical and clinical research towards better therapy for the respiratory deficits associated with DM1.</p>

Gut bacteria selectively promoted by dietary fibers alleviate type 2 diabetes
<p>The gut microbiota benefits humans via short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production from carbohydrate fermentation, and deficiency in SCFA production is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

When the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>-promoted SCFA producers were present in greater diversity and abundance, participants had better improvement in hemoglobin A1c levels, partly via increased glucagon-like peptide-1 production. Promotion of these positive responders diminished producers of metabolically detrimental compounds such as indole and hydrogen sulfide. Targeted restoration of these SCFA producers may present a novel ecological approach for managing T2DM.</p>

How are DNAs woven into chromosomes?
<p>It was not recognized that chromosomes contain one immensely long DNA molecule until Kleinschmidt <i>et al.</i> published electron micrographs of a lysed bacterial cell with DNA spilling out that contained no apparent breaks and, indeed, not even any free ends (<i>1</i>). We now know that before replication, each of our chromosomes contains a single DNA molecule of immense length. If the DNA of an average human chromatid were a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wire</span></strong> with a diameter of 2 mm, then this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wire</span></strong> would be 50 km long. The vast length of chromosomal DNAs poses a number of fundamental problems. For example, how are they packaged during cell division into cylindrical threadlike chromatids? On page 672 of this issue, Terakawa <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) describe an activity associated with a protein complex called condensin that has the potential to answer this. Remarkably, it might also explain chromosome segregation in bacteria as well as the mechanism that regulates enhancer-promoter interactions during development.</p>

Spatiotemporal mode-locking in multimode fiber lasers
<p>A laser is based on the electromagnetic modes of its resonator, which provides the feedback required for oscillation. Enormous progress has been made toward controlling the interactions of longitudinal modes in lasers with a single transverse mode. For example, the field of ultrafast science has been built on lasers that lock many longitudinal modes together to form ultrashort light pulses. However, coherent superposition of longitudinal and transverse modes in a laser has received little attention. We show that modal and chromatic dispersions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong> lasers can be counteracted by strong spatial and spectral filtering. This allows locking of multiple transverse and longitudinal modes to create ultrashort pulses with a variety of spatiotemporal profiles.

Actin protects mammalian eggs against chromosome segregation errors
<p>Chromosome segregation is driven by a spindle that is made of microtubules but is generally thought to be independent of actin. Here, we report an unexpected actin-dependent mechanism that drives the accurate alignment and segregation of chromosomes in mammalian eggs. Prominent actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s permeated the microtubule spindle in eggs of several mammalian species, including humans. Disrupting actin in mouse eggs led to significantly increased numbers of misaligned chromosomes as well as lagging chromosomes during meiosis I and II. We found that actin drives accurate chromosome segregation by promoting the formation of functional kinetochore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s, the microtubule bundles that align and segregate the chromosomes. Thus, actin is essential to prevent chromosome segregation errors in eggs, which are a leading cause of miscarriages, infertility, and Down syndrome.</p>

Actin divides to conquer

Guanine glycation repair by DJ-1/Park7 and its bacterial homologs
<p>DNA damage induced by reactive carbonyls (mainly methylglyoxal and glyoxal), called DNA glycation, is quantitatively as important as oxidative damage. DNA glycation is associated with increased mutation frequency, DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> breaks, and cytotoxicity. However, in contrast to guanine oxidation repair, how glycated DNA is repaired remains undetermined. Here, we found that the parkinsonism-associated protein DJ-1 and its bacterial homologs Hsp31, YhbO, and YajL could repair methylglyoxal- and glyoxal-glycated nucleotides and nucleic acids. DJ-1–depleted cells displayed increased levels of glycated DNA, DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> breaks, and phosphorylated p53. Deglycase-deficient bacterial mutants displayed increased levels of glycated DNA and RNA and exhibited strong mutator phenotypes. Thus, DJ-1 and its prokaryotic homologs constitute a major nucleotide repair system that we name guanine glycation repair.</p>

Treadmilling by FtsZ filaments drives peptidoglycan synthesis and bacterial cell division
<p>The mechanism by which bacteria divide is not well understood. Cell division is mediated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s of FtsZ and FtsA (FtsAZ) that recruit septal peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes to the division site. To understand how these components coordinate to divide cells, we visualized their movements relative to the dynamics of cell wall synthesis during cytokinesis. We found that the division septum was built at discrete sites that moved around the division plane. FtsAZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s treadmilled circumferentially around the division ring and drove the motions of the peptidoglycan-synthesizing enzymes. The FtsZ treadmilling rate controlled both the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis and cell division. Thus, FtsZ treadmilling guides the progressive insertion of new cell wall by building increasingly smaller concentric rings of peptidoglycan to divide the cell.</p>

Control of meiotic pairing and recombination by chromosomally tethered 26<i>S</i> proteasome
<p>During meiosis, paired homologous chromosomes (homologs) become linked via the synaptonemal complex (SC) and crossovers. Crossovers mediate homolog segregation and arise from self-inflicted double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> breaks (DSBs). Here, we identified a role for the proteasome, the multisubunit protease that degrades proteins in the nucleus and cytoplasm, in homolog juxtaposition and crossing over. Without proteasome function, homologs failed to pair and instead remained associated with nonhomologous chromosomes. Although dispensable for noncrossover formation, a functional proteasome was required for a coordinated transition that entails SC assembly between longitudinally organized chromosome axes and stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> exchange of crossover-designated DSBs. Notably, proteolytic core and regulatory proteasome particles were recruited to chromosomes by Zip3, the ortholog of mammalian E3 ligase RNF212, and SC protein Zip1 . We conclude that proteasome functions along meiotic chromosomes are evolutionarily conserved.</p>

Braiding a molecular knot with eight crossings
<p>Knots may ultimately prove just as versatile and useful at the nanoscale as at the macroscale. However, the lack of synthetic routes to all but the simplest molecular knots currently prevents systematic investigation of the influence of knotting at the molecular level. We found that it is possible to assemble four building blocks into three braided ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s. Octahedral iron(II) ions control the relative positions of the three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>s at each crossing point in a circular triple helicate, while structural constraints on the ligands determine the braiding connections. This approach enables two-step assembly of a molecular 8<sub>19</sub> knot featuring eight nonalternating crossings in a 192-atom closed loop ~20 nanometers in length. The resolved metal-free 8<sub>19</sub> knot enantiomers have pronounced features in their circular dichroism spectra resulting solely from topological chirality.</p>

The DNA-sensing AIM2 inflammasome controls radiation-induced cell death and tissue injury
<p>Acute exposure to ionizing radiation induces massive cell death and severe damage to tissues containing actively proliferating cells, including bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this pathology remain controversial. Here, we show that mice deficient in the double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong>ed DNA sensor AIM2 are protected from both subtotal body irradiation–induced gastrointestinal syndrome and total body irradiation–induced hematopoietic failure. AIM2 mediates the caspase-1–dependent death of intestinal epithelial cells and bone marrow cells in response to double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> DNA breaks caused by ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents. Mechanistically, we found that AIM2 senses radiation-induced DNA damage in the nucleus to mediate inflammasome activation and cell death. Our results suggest that AIM2 may be a new therapeutic target for ionizing radiation exposure.</p>

Deterministic generation of a cluster state of entangled photons
<p>Photonic cluster states are a resource for quantum computation based solely on single-photon measurements. We use semiconductor quantum dots to deterministically generate long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">string</span></strong>s of polarization-entangled photons in a cluster state by periodic timed excitation of a precessing matter qubit. In each period, an entangled photon is added to the cluster state formed by the matter qubit and the previously emitted photons. In our prototype device, the qubit is the confined dark exciton, and it produces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">string</span></strong>s of hundreds of photons in which the entanglement persists over five sequential photons. The measured process map characterizing the device has a fidelity of 0.81 with that of an ideal device. Further feasible improvements of this device may reduce the resources needed for optical quantum information processing.</p>

Hydrogen Sulfide Disturbs Actin Polymerization via <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration Resulting in Stunted Root Hair Growth
<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important signaling molecule in plants. Our previous report suggested that H<sub>2</sub>S signaling affects the actin cytoskeleton and root hair growth. However, the underlying mechanisms of its effects are not understood. <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration of proteins is regulated directly by H<sub>2</sub>S, which converts the thiol groups of cysteine (Cys) residues to persulfides and alters protein function. In this work, we studied the effects of <i>S</i>-sulfhydration on actin dynamics in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We generated transgenic plants overexpressing the H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis-related genes <i><sc>l</sc>-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE</i> (<i>LCD</i>) and <i><sc>d</sc>-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE</i> in the <i>O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase isoform a1</i> (<i>oasa1</i>) mutant and Columbia-0 backgrounds. The H<sub>2</sub>S content increased significantly in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. The density of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>ous actin (F-actin) bundles and the F-actin/globular actin ratio decreased in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration also was enhanced in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. An analysis of actin dynamics suggested that <i>S</i>-sulfhydration inhibited actin polymerization. We also found that ACTIN2 (ACT2) was <i>S</i>-sulfhydrated at Cys-287. Cys-287 is adjacent to the D-loop, which acts as a central region for hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and stabilizes F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">filament</span></strong>s. Overaccumulation of H<sub>2</sub>S caused the depolymerization of F-actin bundles and inhibited root hair growth. Introduction of <i>ACT2</i> carrying a Cys-287-to-Ser mutation into an <i>act2-1</i> mutant partially suppressed H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent inhibition of root hair growth. We conclude that H<sub>2</sub>S regulates actin dynamics and affects root hair growth.</p>

GhCPK33 Negatively Regulates Defense against <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> by Phosphorylating GhOPR3
<p><i>Verticillium</i> wilt, caused by the soil-borne fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>, is a destructive vascular disease in plants. Approximately 200 dicotyledonous plant species in temperate and subtropical regions are susceptible to this notorious pathogen. Previous studies showed that jasmonic acid (JA) plays a crucial role in plant-<i>V. dahliae</i> interactions. <i>V. dahliae</i> infection generally induces significant JA accumulation in local and distal tissues of the plant. Although JA biosynthesis and the associated enzymes have been studied intensively, the precise mechanism regulating JA biosynthesis upon <i>V. dahliae</i> infection remains unknown. Here, we identified the calcium-dependent protein kinase GhCPK33 from upland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) as a negative regulator of resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> that directly manipulates JA biosynthesis. Knockdown of <i>GhCPK33</i> by <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i>-mediated virus-induced gene silencing constitutively activated JA biosynthesis and JA-mediated defense responses and enhanced resistance to <i>V</i>. <i>dahliae</i>. Further analysis revealed that GhCPK33 interacts with 12-oxophytodienoate reductase3 (GhOPR3) in peroxisomes. GhCPK33 phosphorylates GhOPR3 at threonine-246, leading to decreased stability of GhOPR3, which consequently limits JA biosynthesis. We propose that GhCPK33 is a potential molecular target for improving resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt disease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong>.</p>

Functional Specialization of Cellulose Synthase Isoforms in a Moss Shows Parallels with Seed Plants
<p>The secondary cell walls of tracheary elements and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s are rich in cellulose microfibrils that are helically oriented and laterally aggregated. Support cells within the leaf midribs of mosses deposit cellulose-rich secondary cell walls, but their biosynthesis and microfibril organization have not been examined. Although the <i>Cellulose Synthase</i> (<i>CESA</i>) gene families of mosses and seed plants diversified independently, <i>CESA</i> knockout analysis in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> revealed parallels with Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in CESA functional specialization, with roles for both subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization. The similarities include regulatory uncoupling of the CESAs that synthesize primary and secondary cell walls, a requirement for two or more functionally distinct CESA isoforms for secondary cell wall synthesis, interchangeability of some primary and secondary CESAs, and some CESA redundancy. The cellulose-deficient midribs of <i>ppcesa3/8</i> knockouts provided negative controls for the structural characterization of stereid secondary cell walls in wild type <i>P. patens</i>. Sum frequency generation spectra collected from midribs were consistent with cellulose microfibril aggregation, and polarization microscopy revealed helical microfibril orientation only in wild type leaves. Thus, stereid secondary walls are structurally distinct from primary cell walls, and they share structural characteristics with the secondary walls of tracheary elements and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fiber</span></strong>s. We propose a mechanism for the convergent evolution of secondary walls in which the deposition of aggregated and helically oriented microfibrils is coupled to rapid and highly localized cellulose synthesis enabled by regulatory uncoupling from primary wall synthesis.</p>

5-Aminolevulinic Acid Dehydratase Gene Dosage Affects Programmed Cell Death and Immunity
<p>Programmed cell death (PCD) is an important form to protect plants from pathogen attack. However, plants must precisely control the PCD process under microbe attacks to avoid detrimental effects. The complexity of how plants balance the defense activation and PCD requires further clarification. Lesion mimic mutants constitute an excellent material to study the crosstalk between them. Here, we identified a <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong>) lesion mimic mutant (<i>Ghlmm</i>), which exhibits necrotic leaf damage and enhanced disease resistance. Map-based cloning demonstrated that <i>GhLMMD</i>, encoding 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and located on chromosome D5, was responsible for the phenotype. The mutant was resulted from a nonsense mutation within the coding region of <i>GhLMMD</i>. It exhibited an overaccumulation of the 5-aminolevulinic acid, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species and salicylic acid, along with constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related genes and enhanced resistance to the <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> infection. Interestingly, <i>GhLMM</i> plays a dosage-dependent role in regulating PCD of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> leaves and resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> infection. This study provides a new strategy on the modulation of plant immunity, particularly in polyploidy plants.</p>

Resolvase OsGEN1 Mediates DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Yen1/GEN1 are canonical Holliday junction resolvases that belong to the RAD2/XPG family. In eukaryotes, such as budding yeast, mice, worms, and humans, Yen1/GEN1 work together with Mus81-Mms4/MUS81-EME1 and Slx1-Slx4/SLX1-SLX4 in DNA repair by homologous recombination to maintain genome stability. In plants, the biological function of Yen1/GEN1 remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized the loss of function mutants of <i>OsGEN1</i> and <i>OsSEND1</i>, a pair of paralogs of Yen1/GEN1 in rice (<i>Oryza</i> <i>sativa</i>). We first investigated the role of <i>OsGEN1</i> during meiosis and found a reduction in chiasma frequency by ∼6% in <i>osgen1</i> mutants, compared to the wild type, suggesting a possible involvement of OsGEN1 in the formation of crossovers. Postmeiosis, OsGEN1 foci were detected in wild-type microspore nuclei, but not in the <i>osgen1</i> mutant concomitant with an increase in double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> breaks. Persistent double-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">strand</span></strong> breaks led to programmed cell death of the male gametes and complete male sterility. In contrast, depletion of <i>OsSEND1</i> had no effects on plant development and did not enhance <i>osgen1</i> defects. Our results indicate that OsGEN1 is essential for homologous recombinational DNA repair at two stages of microsporogenesis in rice.</p>

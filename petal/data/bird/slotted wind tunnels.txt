Vaccination opponents target CDC panel
<p>The U.S. antivaccine movement has found a new front for its attack on scientists and their work: gatherings of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which recommends which vaccines Americans should receive. Since last summer, increasing numbers of vaccine resisters have come to ACIP meetings, held three times a year at the campus of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ion in Atlanta. There, amid heightened security during a public comment session last week, scores of vaccine opponents applauded as others <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ed their anger at the 15 buttoned-down experts on the panel—and lambasted vaccination in general. "This may be the new normal," said ACIP Chair José Romero, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock.</p>

The 2018 rift eruption and summit collapse of Kīlauea Volcano
<p>In 2018, Kīlauea Volcano experienced its largest lower East Rift Zone (LERZ) eruption and caldera collapse in at least 200 years. After collapse of the Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong> on 30 April, magma propagated downrift. Eruptive fissures opened in the LERZ on 3 May, e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ually extending ~6.8 kilometers. A 4 May earthquake [moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 6.9] produced ~5 meters of fault slip. Lava erupted at rates exceeding 100 cubic meters per second, e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>ually covering 35.5 square kilometers. The summit magma system partially drained, producing minor explosions and near-daily collapses releasing energy equivalent to <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 4.7 to 5.4 earthquakes. Activity declined rapidly on 4 August. Summit collapse and lava flow volume estimates are roughly equivalent—about 0.8 cubic kilometers. Careful historical observation and monitoring of Kīlauea enabled successful forecasting of hazardous e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>s.</p>

Volcanic tremor and plume height hysteresis from Pavlof Volcano, Alaska
<p>The March 2016 eruption of Pavlof Volcano, Alaska, produced an ash plume that caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights in North America. The eruption generated strong tremor that was recorded by seismic and remote low-frequency acoustic (infrasound) stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array. The relationship between the tremor amplitudes and plume height changes considerably between the waxing and waning portions of the eruption. Similar hysteresis has been observed between seismic river noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and erosional processes in both rivers and volcanoes can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in geophysical data. We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the tremor source related to volcanic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong> erosion. This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity.</p>

Sulfur Oxidation Genes in Diverse Deep-Sea Viruses
<sec><title>Virus-Enhanced Sulfur Oxidation</title><p>How do microbial viruses affect subsurface microbial communities? <bold>Anantharaman <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 757, published online 1 May) investigated the interactions between ubiquitous marine lithotrophs found at hydrothermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vent</span></strong>s and their viruses. The genes for sulfur oxidation in viruses that infect abundant marine chemosynthetic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria enhanced sulfur oxidation, thereby influencing the biogeochemical sulfur cycle.</p></sec>

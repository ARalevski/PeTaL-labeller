Photoperiod and temperature responses of bud swelling and bud burst in four temperate forest tree species
<p>Spring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenolog</span></strong>y of temperate forest trees is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The release from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>. We investigated the response of early spring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenolog</span></strong>y to temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> at different stages of dormancy release in cuttings from four temperate tree species in controlled environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud swelling and bud growth in <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L., <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Mattuschka) Liebl. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy release, the onset and duration of the bud swelling prior to bud burst are driven by concurrent temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>, while the maximum growth rate is temperature dependent only, except for <i>Fagus</i>, where long <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>s also increased bud growth rates. Similarly, the later bud burst was controlled by temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> (in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> sensitive species <i>Fagus, Quercus</i> and <i>Picea</i>). We conclude that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> is involved in the release of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud burst in trees that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud swelling period that precedes and defines later <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenolog</span></strong>ical stages such as canopy greening in conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenolog</span></strong>ical works. It is the early bud growth resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenolog</span></strong>y at a large scale. Classic spring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenolog</span></strong>y events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here.</p>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenolog</span></strong>ical life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>ic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> and temperature as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>s promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>s extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool temperatures under both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>ic conditions delayed bud development. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

Comparative Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Checkpoint Recovery Identifies New Regulators of the DNA Damage Response
<sec><title>Uncovering the Damage Recovery Phosphoproteome</title><p>DNA damage triggers a signaling cascade that leads to cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e arrest and DNA repair or cell death.

The Extra-Pathway Interactome of the TCA Cycle: Expected and Unexpected Metabolic Interactions
<p>The plant tricarboxylic acid (TCA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e provides essential precursors for respiration, amino acid biosynthesis, and general nitrogen metabolism; moreover, it is closely involved in biotic stress responses and cellular redox homeostasis. To further understand the in vivo function of the TCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e enzymes, we combined affinity purification with proteomics to generate a comprehensive extra-pathway protein-protein interaction network of the plant TCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e. We identified 125 extra-pathway interactions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mostly related to the mitochondrial electron transport complex/ATP synthesis and amino acid metabolism but also to proteins associated with redox stress. We chose three high-scoring and two low-scoring interactions for complementary bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays, which highlighted the reliability of our approach, supported the intimate involvement of TCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e enzymes within many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes, and reflected metabolic changes reported previously for the corresponding mutant lines. To analyze the function of a subset of these interactions, we selected two mutants of mitochondrial glutaredoxin S15 and Amidase, which have not yet been analyzed with respect to their TCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e function, and performed metabolite profiling and flux analysis. Consistent with their interactions identified in this study, TCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e metabolites and the relative TCA flux of the two mutants were altered significantly.</p>

Simulated browsing affects leaf shedding phenology and litter quality of oak and birch saplings
<p>Herbivore effects on leaf litter can have a strong impact on ecosystem nutrient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>ing. Although such effects are well described for insect herbivory, research on the impacts of browsing by mammalian herbivores on leaf litter dynamics and nutrient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>ing has been more limited, particularly at the level of the individual plant. Clipping treatments (66% shoot removal twice, plus unclipped) were applied to analyse the effect of browsing on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenolog</span></strong>y (start date and pattern of leaf shedding) and leaf litter quality (nitrogen (N), soluble sugars, starch and total non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, plus C : N ratios) of <i>Betula pubescens</i> Ehrh. and <i>Quercus petraea</i> [Matt.] Liebl. saplings. Clipping decreased leaf litter biomass and delayed leaf senescence and shedding, but did not change the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenolog</span></strong>ical timing of litterfall between senescence and shedding. The quality of leaf litter of both species was increased by simulated browsing, through an increase in N and carbohydrate concentrations (mainly soluble sugars) and a decreased C : N ratio. This is the first evidence we are aware of that browsing may cause changes in leaf shedding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phenolog</span></strong>y, delaying the process without altering its pattern. Our results also indicate that simulated browsing increases the quality of leaf litter. However, the potential positive effect of browsing on N <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>ing through litter quality may be offset by its negative impact on the amount of N shed per tree.</p>

A primordial and reversible TCA cycle in a facultatively chemolithoautotrophic thermophile
<p>Inorganic carbon fixation is essential to sustain life on Earth, and the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e is one of the most ancient carbon fixation metabolisms. A combination of genomic, enzymatic, and metabolomic analyses of a deeply branching chemolithotrophic <i>Thermosulfidibacter takaii</i> ABI70S6<sup>T</sup> revealed a previously unknown reversible TCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e whose direction was controlled by the available carbon source(s). Under a chemolithoautotrophic condition, a rTCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e occurred with the reverse reaction of citrate synthase (CS) and not with the adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent citrate cleavage reactions that had been regarded as essential for the conventional rTCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e. Phylometabolic evaluation suggests that the TCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e with reversible CS may represent an ancestral mode of the rTCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e and raises the possibility of a facultatively chemolithomixotrophic origin of life.</p>

Multiplex recording of cellular events over time on CRISPR biological tape
<p>Although dynamics underlie many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes, our ability to robustly and accurately profile time-varying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals and regulatory programs remains limited. Here we describe a framework for storing temporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical information directly in the genomes of a cell population. We developed a “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical tape recorder” in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then recorded by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable recording over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously record the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical events on a large scale.</p>

Biological uptake and reversible scavenging of zinc in the global ocean
<p>Zinc (Zn) is a key micronutrient for marine phytoplankton, with a global distribution that is similar to silicic acid. The processes that govern this relationship, despite the very different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>ing of Zn and silica, remain poorly understood. Here, we use diagnostic and mechanistic models to show that only a combination of Southern Ocean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical uptake and reversible scavenging of Zn onto sinking particles can explain the observations. The distinction between organic and adsorbed Zn can also reconcile the vertical distribution and mass balance of Zn isotopes, which previously appeared at odds.

Triphosphate Tunnel Metalloenzyme Function in Senescence Highlights a Biological Diversification of This Protein Superfamily
<p>The triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme (TTM) superfamily comprises a group of enzymes that hydrolyze organophosphate substrates. They exist in all domains of life, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical role of most family members is unclear. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) encodes three <i>TTM</i> genes. We have previously reported that AtTTM2 displays pyrophosphatase activity and is involved in pathogen resistance. Here, we report the biochemical activity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function of <i>AtTTM1</i> and diversification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical roles between <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>2</i>. Biochemical analyses revealed that AtTTM1 displays pyrophosphatase activity similar to AtTTM2, making them the only TTMs characterized so far to act on a diphosphate substrate. However, knockout mutant analysis showed that <i>AtTTM1</i> is not involved in pathogen resistance but rather in leaf senescence. <i>AtTTM1</i> is transcriptionally up-regulated during leaf senescence, and knockout mutants of <i>AtTTM1</i> exhibit delayed dark-induced and natural senescence. The double mutant of <i>AtTTM1</i> and <i>AtTTM2</i> did not show synergistic effects, further indicating the diversification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical function. However, promoter swap analyses revealed that they functionally can complement each other, and confocal microscopy revealed that both proteins are tail-anchored proteins that localize to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Additionally, transient overexpression of either gene in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> induced senescence-like cell death upon dark treatment. Taken together, we show that two TTMs display the same biochemical properties but distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions that are governed by their transcriptional regulation. Moreover, this work reveals a possible connection of immunity-related programmed cell death and senescence through novel mitochondrial tail-anchored proteins.</p>

Circadian, Carbon, and Light Control of Expansion Growth and Leaf Movement
<p>We used Phytotyping<sup>4D</sup> to investigate the contribution of clock and light signaling to the diurnal regulation of rosette expansion growth and leaf movement in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Wild-type plants and clock mutants with a short (<i>lhycca1</i>) and long (<i>prr7prr9</i>) period were analyzed in a T24 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e and in T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>es that were closer to the mutants’ period. Wild types also were analyzed in various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>s and after transfer to free-running light or darkness. Rosette expansion and leaf movement exhibited a circadian oscillation, with superimposed transients after dawn and dusk. Diurnal responses were modified in clock mutants. <i>lhycca1</i> exhibited an inhibition of growth at the end of night and growth rose earlier after dawn, whereas <i>prr7prr9</i> showed decreased growth for the first part of the light period. Some features were partly rescued by a matching T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e, like the inhibition in <i>lhycca1</i> at the end of the night, indicating that it is due to premature exhaustion of starch. Other features were not rescued, revealing that the clock also regulates expansion growth more directly. Expansion growth was faster at night than in the daytime, whereas published work has shown that the synthesis of cellular components is faster in the day than at nighttime. This temporal uncoupling became larger in short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>s and may reflect the differing dependence of expansion and biosynthesis on energy, carbon, and water. While it has been proposed that leaf expansion and movement are causally linked, we did not observe a consistent temporal relationship between expansion and leaf movement.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

The matricellular protein TSP1 promotes human and mouse endothelial cell senescence through CD47 and Nox1
<p>Senescent cells withdraw from the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e and do not proliferate. The prevalence of senescent compared to normally functioning parenchymal cells increases with age, impairing tissue and organ homeostasis. A contentious principle governing this process has been the redox theory of aging. We linked matricellular protein thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) and its receptor CD47 to the activation of NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1), but not of the other closely related Nox isoforms, and associated oxidative stress, and to senescence in human cells and aged tissue. In human endothelial cells, TSP1 promoted senescence and attenuated cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e progression and proliferation. At the molecular level, TSP1 increased Nox1-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the increased abundance of the transcription factor p53. p53 mediated a DNA damage response that led to senescence through Rb and p21<sup>cip</sup>, both of which inhibit cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e progression. Nox1 inhibition blocked the ability of TSP1 to increase p53 nuclear localization and p21<sup>cip</sup> abundance and its ability to promote senescence. Mice lacking TSP1 showed decreases in ROS production, p21<sup>cip</sup> expression, p53 activity, and aging-induced senescence. Conversely, lung tissue from aging humans displayed increases in the abundance of vascular TSP1, Nox1, p53, and p21<sup>cip</sup>. Finally, genetic ablation or pharmacological blockade of Nox1 in human endothelial cells attenuated TSP1-mediated ROS generation, restored cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e progression, and protected against senescence. Together, our results provide insights into the functional interplay between TSP1 and Nox1 in the regulation of endothelial senescence and suggest potential targets for controlling the aging process at the molecular level.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems

Many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems incorporate power-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small sizes. We establish how power enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own force-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical and synthetic systems. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. This analysis defines the cascading challenges of power enhancement, explores their emergent effects in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical and engineered systems, and charts a pathway for higher-level analysis and synthesis of power-amplified systems.</p>

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource and Gene Set Linkage Analysis: A Transcriptomic Analysis Resource
<p>An advanced functional understanding of omics data is important for elucidating the design logic of physiological processes in plants and effectively controlling desired traits in plants. We present the latest versions of the Predicted Arabidopsis Interactome Resource (PAIR) and of the gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool, which enable the interpretation of an observed transcriptomic change (differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with respect to its functional impact for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. PAIR version 5.0 integrates functional association data between genes in multiple forms and infers 335,301 putative functional interactions. GSLA relies on this high-confidence inferred functional association network to expand our perception of the functional impacts of an observed transcriptomic change. GSLA then interprets the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical significance of the observed DEGs using established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical concepts (annotation terms), describing not only the DEGs themselves but also their potential functional impacts. This unique analytical capability can help researchers gain deeper insights into their experimental results and highlight prospective directions for further investigation. We demonstrate the utility of GSLA with two case studies in which GSLA uncovered how molecular events may have caused physiological changes through their collective functional influence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. Furthermore, we showed that typical annotation-enrichment tools were unable to produce similar insights to PAIR/GSLA.

The Energy-Signaling Hub SnRK1 Is Important for Sucrose-Induced Hypocotyl Elongation
<p>Emerging seedlings respond to environmental conditions such as light and temperature to optimize their establishment. Seedlings grow initially through elongation of the hypocotyl, which is regulated by signaling pathways that integrate environmental information to regulate seedling development. The hypocotyls of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) also elongate in response to sucrose. Here, we investigated the role of cellular sugar-sensing mechanisms in the elongation of hypocotyls in response to Suc. We focused upon the role of SnRK1, which is a sugar-signaling hub that regulates metabolism and transcription in response to cellular energy status. We also investigated the role of TPS1, which synthesizes the signaling sugar trehalose-6-P that is proposed to regulate SnRK1 activity. Under light/dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>es, we found that Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation did not occur in <i>tps1</i> mutants and overexpressors of KIN10 (AKIN10/SnRK1.1), a catalytic subunit of SnRK1. We demonstrate that the magnitude of Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation depends on the day length and light intensity. We identified roles for auxin and gibberellin signaling in Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation under short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>s. We found that Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation under light/dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>es does not involve another proposed sugar sensor, HEXOKINASE1, or the circadian oscillator. Our study identifies novel roles for KIN10 and TPS1 in mediating a signal that underlies Suc-induced hypocotyl elongation in light/dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>es.</p>

<i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> Redundancy Fine-Tunes Photoperiod Sensitivity
<p>Three pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) loci controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> sensitivity, <i>HIGH RESPONSE</i> (<i>HR</i>), <i>DIE NEUTRALIS</i> (<i>DNE</i>), and <i>STERILE NODES</i> (<i>SN</i>), have recently been shown to correspond to orthologs of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian clock genes <i>EARLY FLOWERING3</i> (<i>ELF3</i>), <i>ELF4</i>, and <i>LUX ARRHYTHMO</i>, respectively. A fourth pea locus, <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong></i> (<i>PPD</i>), also contributes to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> response in a similar manner to <i>SN</i> and <i>DNE</i>, and recessive <i>ppd</i> mutants on a spring-flowering <i>hr</i> mutant background show early, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong>-insensitive flowering. However, the molecular identity of <i>PPD</i> has so far remained elusive. Here, we show that the <i>PPD</i> locus also has a role in maintenance of diurnal and circadian gene expression rhythms and identify <i>PPD</i> as an <i>ELF3</i> co-ortholog, termed <i>ELF3b</i>. Genetic interactions between pea <i>ELF3</i> genes suggest that loss of <i>PPD</i> function does not affect flowering time in the presence of functional <i>HR</i>, whereas <i>PPD</i> can compensate only partially for the lack of <i>HR</i>. These results provide an illustration of how gene duplication and divergence can generate potential for the emergence of more subtle variations in phenotype that may be adaptively significant.</p>

Mitotic phosphotyrosine network analysis reveals that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)
<p>Tyrosine phosphorylation is closely associated with cell proliferation. During the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e, serine and threonine phosphorylation plays the leading role, and such phosphorylation events are most dynamic during the mitotic phase of the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e. However, mitotic phosphotyrosine is not well characterized. Although a few functionally-relevant mitotic phosphotyrosine sites have been characterized, evidence suggests that this modification may be more prevalent than previously appreciated. Here, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation in mitotic human cells including those on spindle-associated proteins.? Database mining confirmed ~2000 mitotic phosphotyrosine sites, and network analysis revealed a number of subnetworks that were enriched in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including components of the kinetochore or spindle and SRC family kinases. We identified Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a major signaling hub in the spindle subnetwork, as phosphorylated at the conserved Tyr<sup>217</sup> in the kinase domain. Substitution of Tyr<sup>217</sup> with a phosphomimetic residue eliminated PLK1 activity in vitro and in cells. Further analysis showed that Tyr<sup>217</sup> phosphorylation reduced the phosphorylation of Thr<sup>210</sup> in the activation loop, a phosphorylation event necessary for PLK1 activity. Our data indicate that mitotic tyrosine phosphorylation regulated a key serine/threonine kinase hub in mitotic cells and suggested that spatially separating tyrosine phosphorylation events can reveal previously unrecognized regulatory events and complexes associated with specific structures of the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e.</p>

Loss of MCU prevents mitochondrial fusion in G<sub>1</sub>-S phase and blocks cell cycle progression and proliferation
<p>The role of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU) in physiologic cell proliferation remains to be defined. Here, we demonstrated that the MCU was required to match mitochondrial function to metabolic demands during the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e. During the G<sub>1</sub>-S transition (the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e phase with the highest mitochondrial ATP output), mitochondrial fusion, oxygen consumption, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake increased in wild-type cells but not in cells lacking MCU. In proliferating wild-type control cells, the addition of the growth factors promoted the activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) and the phosphorylation of the mitochondrial fission factor Drp1 at Ser<sup>616</sup>. The lack of the MCU was associated with baseline activation of CaMKII, mitochondrial fragmentation due to increased Drp1 phosphorylation, and impaired mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. The mitochondrial fission/fusion ratio and proliferation in MCU-deficient cells recovered after MCU restoration or inhibition of mitochondrial fragmentation or of CaMKII in the cytosol. Our data highlight a key function for the MCU in mitochondrial adaptation to the metabolic demands during cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e progression. Cytosolic CaMKII and the MCU participate in a regulatory circuit, whereby mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake affects cell proliferation through Drp1.</p>

Dephosphorylation of protamine 2 at serine 56 is crucial for murine sperm maturation in vivo
<p>The posttranslational modification of histones is crucial in spermatogenesis, as in other tissues; however, during spermiogenesis, histones are replaced with protamines, which are critical for the tight packaging of the DNA in sperm cells. Protamines are also posttranslationally modified by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which prompted our investigation of the underlying mechanisms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical consequences of their regulation. On the basis of a screen that implicated the heat shock protein Hspa4l in spermatogenesis, we generated mice deficient in Hspa4l (<i>Hspa4l</i>-null mice), which showed male infertility and the malformation of sperm heads. These phenotypes are similar to those of <i>Ppp1cc</i>-deficient mice, and we found that the amount of a testis- and sperm-specific isoform of the Ppp1cc phosphatase (Ppp1cc2) in the chromatin-binding fraction was substantially less in <i>Hspa4l</i>-null spermatozoa than that in those of wild-type mice. We further showed that Ppp1cc2 was a substrate of the chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp70 and that Hspa4l enhanced the release of Ppp1cc2 from these complexes, enabling the freed Ppp1cc2 to localize to chromatin. Pull-down and in vitro phosphatase assays suggested the dephosphorylation of protamine 2 at serine 56 (Prm2 Ser<sup>56</sup>) by Ppp1cc2. To confirm the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical importance of Prm2 Ser<sup>56</sup> dephosphorylation, we mutated Ser<sup>56</sup> to alanine in Prm2 (Prm2 S56A). Introduction of this mutation to <i>Hspa4l</i>-null mice (<i>Hspa4l</i><sup>−/−</sup>; <i>Prm2</i><sup>S56A/S56A</sup>) restored the malformation of sperm heads and the infertility of <i>Hspa4l</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice. The dephosphorylation signal to eliminate phosphate was crucial, and these results unveiled the mechanism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical relevance of the dephosphorylation of Prm2 for sperm maturation in vivo.</p>

The sleep-wake cycle regulates brain interstitial fluid tau in mice and CSF tau in humans
<p>The sleep-wake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e regulates interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of β-amyloid (Aβ) that accumulates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Furthermore, chronic sleep deprivation (SD) increases Aβ plaques. However, tau, not Aβ, accumulation appears to drive AD neurodegeneration. We tested whether ISF/CSF tau and tau seeding and spreading were influenced by the sleep-wake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e and SD. Mouse ISF tau was increased ~90% during normal wakefulness versus sleep and ~100% during SD. Human CSF tau also increased more than 50% during SD. In a tau seeding-and-spreading model, chronic SD increased tau pathology spreading. Chemogenetically driven wakefulness in mice also significantly increased both ISF Aβ and tau. Thus, the sleep-wake <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e regulates ISF tau, and SD increases ISF and CSF tau as well as tau pathology spreading.</p>

Social regulation of insulin signaling and the evolution of eusociality in ants
<p>Queens and workers of eusocial Hymenoptera are considered homologous to the reproductive and brood care phases of an ancestral subsocial life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of reproductive division of labor remain obscure. Using a brain transcriptomics screen, we identified a single gene, <i>insulin-like peptide 2</i> (<i>ilp2</i>), which is always up-regulated in ant reproductives, likely because they are better nourished than their nonreproductive nestmates. In clonal raider ants (<i>Ooceraea biroi</i>), larval signals inhibit adult reproduction by suppressing <i>ilp2</i>, thus producing a colony reproductive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e reminiscent of ancestral subsociality. However, increasing ILP2 peptide levels overrides larval suppression, thereby breaking the colony <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e and inducing a stable division of labor. These findings suggest a simple model for the origin of ant eusociality via nutritionally determined reproductive asymmetries potentially amplified by larval signals.</p>

Bioinspired spring origami

Highly elastic binders integrating polyrotaxanes for silicon microparticle anodes in lithium ion batteries
<p>Lithium-ion batteries with ever-increasing energy densities are needed for batteries for advanced devices and all-electric vehicles.

During repeated charge-discharge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>es, silicon undergoes huge volume changes. This limits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e life via particle pulverization and an unstable electrode-electrolyte interface, especially when the particle sizes are in the micrometer range.

This binder combination keeps even pulverized silicon particles coalesced without disintegration, enabling stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e life for silicon microparticle anodes at commercial-level areal capacities.</p>

Rechargeable nickel–3D zinc batteries: An energy-dense, safer alternative to lithium-ion

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian oscillator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian oscillator period are thought to adjust the timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian oscillator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>es as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the dynamic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the dynamic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical events. Our data provide insight into how the dynamic period adjustment of circadian oscillators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

SIAMESE-RELATED1 Is Regulated Posttranslationally and Participates in Repression of Leaf Growth under Moderate Drought
<p>The plant cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e is tightly regulated by factors that integrate endogenous cues and environmental signals to adapt plant growth to changing conditions. Under drought, cell division in young leaves is blocked by an active mechanism, reducing the evaporative surface and conserving energy resources. The molecular function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>in-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins (CKIs) in regulating the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e has already been well studied, but little is known about their involvement in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e regulation under adverse growth conditions. In this study, we show that the transcript of the CKI gene <i>SIAMESE-RELATED1</i> (<i>SMR1</i>) is quickly induced under moderate drought in young Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Functional characterization further revealed that SMR1 inhibits cell division and affects meristem activity, thereby restricting the growth of leaves and roots. Moreover, we demonstrate that SMR1 is a short-lived protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome after being ubiquitinated by a Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consequently, overexpression of a more stable variant of the SMR1 protein leads to a much stronger phenotype than overexpression of the native SMR1. Under moderate drought, both the <i>SMR1</i> transcript and SMR1 protein accumulate. Despite this induction, <i>smr1</i> mutants do not show overall tolerance to drought stress but do show less growth inhibition of young leaves under drought. Surprisingly, the growth-repressive hormone ethylene promotes <i>SMR1</i> induction, but the classical drought hormone abscisic acid does not.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>ization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Multiplexed Gene Editing and Protein Overexpression Using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> Viral Vector
<p>Development of CRISPR/Cas9 transient gene editing screening tools in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y has been hindered by difficulty of delivering high quantities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ically active single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Furthermore, it has been largely accepted that in vivo generated sgRNAs need to be devoid of extraneous nucleotides, which has limited sgRNA expression by delivery vectors. Here, we increased cellular concentrations of sgRNA by transiently delivering sgRNAs using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-derived vector (TRBO) designed with 5′ and 3′ sgRNA proximal nucleotide-processing capabilities. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we used the TRBO-sgRNA delivery platform to target GFP in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (16c) plants, and gene editing was accompanied by loss of GFP expression. Surprisingly, indel (insertions and deletions) percentages averaged nearly 70% within 7 d postinoculation using the TRBO-sgRNA constructs, which retained 5′ nucleotide overhangs. In contrast, and in accordance with current models, in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays only edited DNA when 5′ sgRNA nucleotide overhangs were removed, suggesting a novel processing mechanism is occurring in planta. Since the Cas9/TRBO-sgRNA platform demonstrated sgRNA flexibility, we targeted the <i>N. benthamiana NbAGO1</i> paralogs with one sgRNA and also multiplexed two sgRNAs using a single TRBO construct, resulting in indels in three genes. TRBO-mediated expression of an RNA transcript consisting of an sgRNA adjoining a GFP protein coding region produced indels and viral-based GFP overexpression. In conclusion, multiplexed delivery of sgRNAs using the TRBO system offers flexibility for gene expression and editing and uncovered novel aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y.</p>

An Animal-Like Cryptochrome Controls the <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Sexual Cycle

We show that aCRY is differentially expressed not only during the life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e but also within the cell as part of the soluble and/or membrane-associated protein fraction. Moreover, localization of aCRY within the algal cell body varies between vegetative cells and the different cell types of gametogenesis. aCRY is significantly (early day) or to a small extent (late night) enriched in the nucleus in vegetative cells. In pregametes, gametes and dark-inactivated gametes, aCRY is localized over the cell body. aCRY plays an important role in the sexual life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>: It controls the germination of the alga, under which the zygote undergoes meiosis, in a positive manner, similar to the regulation by the blue light receptors phototropin and plant cryptochrome (pCRY).

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical system with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Small molecules are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in screens designed with a basic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y perspective.

Molecular Biology and Evolution
The Evolution of Silicon Transport in Eukaryotes
<p>Biosilicification (the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical structures from silica) occurs in diverse eukaryotic lineages, plays a major role in global biogeochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>es, and has significant biotechnological applications. Silicon (Si) uptake is crucial for biosilicification, yet the evolutionary history of the transporters involved remains poorly known. Recent evidence suggests that the SIT family of Si transporters, initially identified in diatoms, may be widely distributed, with an extended family of related transporters (SIT-Ls) present in some nonsilicified organisms. Here, we identify SITs and SIT-Ls in a range of eukaryotes, including major silicified lineages (radiolarians and chrysophytes) and also bacterial SIT-Ls. Our evidence suggests that the symmetrical 10-transmembrane-domain SIT structure has independently evolved multiple times via duplication and fusion of 5-transmembrane-domain SIT-Ls. We also identify a second gene family, similar to the active Si transporter Lsi2, that is broadly distributed amongst siliceous and nonsiliceous eukaryotes. Our analyses resolve a distinct group of Lsi2-like genes, including plant and diatom Si-responsive genes, and sequences unique to siliceous sponges and choanoflagellates. The SIT/SIT-L and Lsi2 transporter families likely contribute to biosilicification in diverse lineages, indicating an ancient role for Si transport in eukaryotes. We propose that these Si transporters may have arisen initially to prevent Si toxicity in the high Si Precambrian oceans, with subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ically induced reductions in Si concentrations of Phanerozoic seas leading to widespread losses of SIT, SIT-L, and Lsi2-like genes in diverse lineages. Thus, the origin and diversification of two independent Si transporter families both drove and were driven by ancient ocean Si levels.</p>

A draft genome of the brown alga, <i>Cladosiphon okamuranus</i>, S-strain: a platform for future studies of ‘mozuku’ biology
<p>The brown alga, <i>Cladosiphon okamuranus</i> (Okinawa mozuku), is economically one of the most important edible seaweeds, and is cultivated for market primarily in Okinawa, Japan. <i>C. okamuranus</i> constitutes a significant source of fucoidan, which has various physiological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical activities. To facilitate studies of seaweed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y, we decoded the draft genome of <i>C. okamuranus</i> S-strain. The genome size of <i>C. okamuranus</i> was estimated as ∼140 Mbp, smaller than genomes of two other brown algae, <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i> and <i>Saccharina japonica</i>. Sequencing with ∼100× coverage yielded an assembly of 541 scaffolds with N50 = 416 kbp. Together with transcriptomic data, we estimated that the <i>C. okamuranus</i> genome contains 13,640 protein-coding genes, approximately 94% of which have been confirmed with corresponding mRNAs. Comparisons with the <i>E. siliculosus</i> genome identified a set of <i>C. okamuranus</i> genes that encode enzymes involved in biosynthetic pathways for sulfated fucans and alginate biosynthesis. In addition, we identified <i>C. okamuranus</i> genes for enzymes involved in phlorotannin biosynthesis. The present decoding of the <i>Cladosiphon okamuranus</i> genome provides a platform for future studies of mozuku <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y.</p>

Rapid and widespread suppression of self-renewal by microRNA-203 during epidermal differentiation
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in differentiation of stem cells. However, the precise dynamics of miRNA induction during stem cell differentiation have not been visualized and molecular mechanisms through which miRNAs execute their function remain unclear. Using high-resolution <i>in situ</i> hybridization together with cell lineage and proliferation markers in mouse skin, we show that miR-203 is transcriptionally activated in the differentiating daughter cells upon the asymmetric cell division of interfollicular progenitor cells. Once induced, miR-203 rapidly promotes the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e exit within 6 hours and abolishes self-renewal of the progenitor cells. With an inducible mouse model, we identify numerous miR-203 <i>in vivo</i> targets that are highly enriched in regulation of cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e and cell division, as well as in response to DNA damage. Importantly, co-suppression of individual targets, including p63, Skp2 and Msi2 by miR-203 is required for its function of promoting the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e exit and inhibiting the long-term proliferation. Together, our findings reveal the rapid and widespread impact of miR-203 on the self-renewal program and provide mechanistic insights into the potent role of miR-203 during the epidermal differentiation. These results should also contribute to understanding the role of miR-203 in the development of skin cancer.</p>

Dedifferentiation, Proliferation, and Redifferentiation of Adult Mammalian Cardiomyocytes After Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Adult mammalian hearts have a limited ability to generate new cardiomyocytes. Proliferation of existing adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs) is a potential source of new cardiomyocytes. Understanding the fundamental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y of ACM proliferation could be of great clinical significance for treating myocardial infarction (MI). We aim to understand the process and regulation of ACM proliferation and its role in new cardiomyocyte formation of post-MI mouse hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>β-Actin-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice and fate-mapping Myh6-MerCreMer-tdTomato/lacZ mice were used to trace the fate of ACMs. In a coculture system with neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, ACM proliferation was documented with clear evidence of cytokinesis observed with time-lapse imaging. Cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult mouse post-MI heart was detected by cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e markers and 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine incorporation analysis. Echocardiography was used to measure cardiac function, and histology was performed to determine infarction size.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vitro, mononucleated and bi/multinucleated ACMs were able to proliferate at a similar rate (7.0%) in the coculture. Dedifferentiation proceeded ACM proliferation, which was followed by redifferentiation. Redifferentiation was essential to endow the daughter cells with cardiomyocyte contractile function. Intercellular propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from contracting neonatal rat ventricular myocytes into ACM daughter cells was required to activate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cell signaling pathway to induce ACM redifferentiation. The properties of neonatal rat ventricular myocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients influenced the rate of ACM redifferentiation. Hypoxia impaired the function of gap junctions by dephosphorylating its component protein connexin 43, the major mediator of intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation between cardiomyocytes, thereby impairing ACM redifferentiation. In vivo, ACM proliferation was found primarily in the MI border zone. An ischemia-resistant connexin 43 mutant enhanced the redifferentiation of ACM-derived new cardiomyocytes after MI and improved cardiac function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Mature ACMs can reenter the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e and form new cardiomyocytes through a 3-step process: dedifferentiation, proliferation, and redifferentiation. Intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal from neighboring functioning cardiomyocytes through gap junctions induces the redifferentiation process. This novel mechanism contributes to new cardiomyocyte formation in post-MI hearts in mammals.</p></sec>

Regulation of Hormonal Control, Cell Reprogramming, and Patterning during De Novo Root Organogenesis
<p>Body regeneration through formation of new organs is a major question in developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. We investigated de novo root formation using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our results show that local cytokinin biosynthesis and auxin biosynthesis in the leaf blade followed by auxin long-distance transport to the petiole leads to proliferation of J0121-marked xylem-associated tissues and others through signaling of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE28 (IAA28), CRANE (IAA18), WOODEN LEG, and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS1 (ARR1), ARR10, and ARR12. Vasculature proliferation also involves the cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e regulator KIP-RELATED PROTEIN2 and ABERRANT LATERAL ROOT FORMATION4, resulting in a mass of cells with rooting competence that resembles callus formation. Endogenous callus formation precedes specification of postembryonic root founder cells, from which roots are initiated through the activity of SHORT-ROOT, PLETHORA1 (PLT1), and PLT2. Primordia initiation is blocked in <i>shr plt1 plt2</i> mutant. Stem cell regulators SCHIZORIZA, JACKDAW, BLUEJAY, and SCARECROW also participate in root initiation and are required to pattern the new organ, as mutants show disorganized and reduced number of layers and tissue initials resulting in reduced rooting. Our work provides an organ regeneration model through de novo root formation, stating key stages and the primary pathways involved.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average plant oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoperiod</span></strong> pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Nitric Oxide Mediates Nitrite-Sensing and Acclimation and Triggers a Remodeling of Lipids
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is an intermediate of the nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e, an industrial pollutant, and a marker of climate change. NO also acts as a gaseous transmitter in a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. The impact of environmental NO needs to be addressed. In diatoms, a dominant phylum in phytoplankton, NO was reported to mediate programmed cell death in response to diatom-derived polyunsaturated aldehydes. Here, using the <i>Phaeodactylum</i> Pt1 strain, 2E,4E-decadienal supplied in the micromolar concentration range led to a nonspecific cell toxicity. We reexamined NO biosynthesis and response in <i>Phaeodactylum</i>. NO inhibits cell growth and triggers triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. Feeding experiments indicate that NO is not produced from Arg but via conversion of nitrite by the nitrate reductase. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis shows that NO up-regulates the expression of the plastid nitrite reductase and genes involved in the subsequent incorporation of ammonium into amino acids, via both Gln synthesis and Orn-urea pathway. The phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is also up-regulated, leading to the production of acetyl-CoA, which can feed TAG accumulation upon exposure to NO. Transcriptional reprogramming leading to higher TAG content is balanced with a decrease of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) in the plastid via posttranslational inhibition of MGDG synthase enzymatic activity by NO. Intracellular and transient NO emission acts therefore at the basis of a nitrite-sensing and acclimating system, whereas a long exposure to NO can additionally induce a redirection of carbon to neutral lipids and a stress response.</p>

A Nucleus-Localized Long Non-Coding RNA Enhances Drought and Salt Stress Tolerance
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene expression through a wide range of mechanisms and are considered as important regulators in many essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. A large number of lncRNA transcripts have been predicted or identified in plants in recent years. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions for most of them are still unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lncRNA, <i>DROUGHT INDUCED lncRNA</i> (<i>DRIR</i>), as a novel positive regulator of the plant response to drought and salt stress. <i>DRIR</i> was expressed at a low level under nonstress conditions but can be significantly activated by drought and salt stress as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. We identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i>, which had higher expression of the <i>DRIR</i> gene than the wild-type plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant exhibits increased tolerance to drought and salt stress. Overexpressing <i>DRIR</i> in Arabidopsis also increased tolerance to drought and salt stress of the transgenic plants. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant and the overexpressing seedlings are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in stomata closure and seedling growth. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the expression of a large number of genes was altered in <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> and the overexpressing plants. These include genes involved in ABA signaling, water transport, and other stress-relief processes. Our study reveals a mechanism whereby <i>DRIR</i> regulates the plant response to abiotic stress by modulating the expression of a series of genes involved in the stress response.</p>

Identification and Metabolite Profiling of Chemical Activators of Lipid Accumulation in Green Algae
<p>Microalgae are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing biofuels and coproducts. However, several limitations must be overcome before algae-based production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce lipid accumulation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this barrier, a chemical genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 compounds were screened against <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, and 243 compounds were identified that increase triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation without terminating growth. Identified compounds were classified by structural similarity, and 15 were selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth fitness, photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch concentrations. TAG accumulation was verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification of total fatty acids, and targeted TAG and galactolipid measurements were performed using liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry. These results demonstrated that TAG accumulation does not necessarily proceed at the expense of galactolipid. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into pathway shifts due to five different compound treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, Calvin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e, tricarboxylic acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e, and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic stresses commonly used to induce oil accumulation in algae. The efficacy of these compounds also was demonstrated in three other algal species. These lipid-inducing compounds offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the biochemical mechanisms of lipid accumulation in algae and a direct means to improve algal oil content independent of the severe growth limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.</p>

In Vitro Characterization of Thermostable CAM Rubisco Activase Reveals a Rubisco Interacting Surface Loop
<p>To maintain metabolic flux through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e in higher plants, dead-end inhibited complexes of Rubisco must constantly be engaged and remodeled by the molecular chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca). In C3 plants, the thermolability of Rca is responsible for the deactivation of Rubisco and reduction of photosynthesis at moderately elevated temperatures. We reasoned that crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants must possess thermostable Rca to support Calvin-Benson-Bassham <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cycl</span></strong>e flux during the day when stomata are closed. A comparative biochemical characterization of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Agave tequilana</i> Rca isoforms demonstrated that the CAM Rca isoforms are approximately10°C more thermostable than the C3 isoforms. Agave Rca also possessed a much higher in vitro biochemical activity, even at low assay temperatures. Mixtures of rice and agave Rca form functional hetero-oligomers in vitro, but only the rice isoforms denature at nonpermissive temperatures. The high thermostability and activity of agave Rca mapped to the N-terminal 244 residues. A Glu-217-Gln amino acid substitution was found to confer high Rca activity to rice Rca. Further mutational analysis suggested that Glu-217 restricts the flexibility of the α4-β4 surface loop that interacts with Rubisco via Lys-216. CAM plants thus promise to be a source of highly functional, thermostable Rca candidates for thermal fortification of crop photosynthesis. Careful characterization of their properties will likely reveal further protein-protein interaction motifs to enrich our mechanistic model of Rca function.</p>

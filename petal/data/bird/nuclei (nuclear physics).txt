Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby correlated single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s cooperatively emit photons. Demonstrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of controlled collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s has resulted from the ability to directly imprint correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> superradiance: Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with predefined correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s). Enhanced collective photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> number was less than unity. The correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> among single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s was achieved by nanometer-precis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> control and phase-aligned state manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s by using a nanohole-array aperture. Our results demonstrate a platform for phase-controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-field interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other mon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

Hyperfine interaction of individual atoms on a surface
<p>Taking advantage of nuclear spins for electronic structure analysis, magnetic resonance imaging, and quantum devices hinges on knowledge and control of the surrounding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic-scale environment. We measured and manipulated the hyperfine interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of individual iron and titanium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s placed on a magnesium oxide surface by using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy in combinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> electron spin resonance. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> manipulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to move single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, we found that the hyperfine interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> strongly depended on the binding configurat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>. We could extract <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>- and posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-dependent informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> about the electronic ground state, the state mixing with neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, and properties of the nuclear spin. Thus, the hyperfine spectrum becomes a powerful probe of the chemical environment of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s and nanostructures.</p>

Measurement of the neutron lifetime using a magneto-gravitational trap and in situ detection
<p>The precise value of the mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> lifetime, τ<sub>n</sub>, plays an important role in nuclear and particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s and cosmology. It is used to predict the ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s to helium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in the primordial universe and to search for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s beyond the Standard Model of particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s. We eliminated loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by levitating polarized ultracold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong>s above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong>s do not interact with material trap walls. As a result of this approach and the use of an in situ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> detector, the lifetime reported here [877.7 ± 0.7 (stat) +0.4/–0.2 (sys) seconds] does not require correct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s larger than the quoted uncertainties.</p>

Atom-by-atom assembly of defect-free one-dimensional cold atom arrays
<p>The realizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of large-scale fully controllable quantum systems is an exciting frontier in modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al science. We use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>-by-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> assembly to implement a platform for the deterministic preparat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of regular one-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al arrays of individually controlled cold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. In our approach, a measurement and feedback procedure eliminates the entropy associated with probabilistic trap occupat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and results in defect-free arrays of more than 50 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in less than 400 milliseconds. The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers, which we use to arrange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in desired geometric patterns and to maintain these configurat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s by replacing lost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s with surplus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s from a reservoir.

Creation of a Bose-condensed gas of <sup>87</sup>Rb by laser cooling
<p>Protocols for attaining quantum degeneracy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic gases almost exclusively rely on evaporative cooling, a time-consuming final step associated with substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. We demonstrate direct laser cooling of a gas of rubidium-87 (<sup>87</sup>Rb) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s to quantum degeneracy. The method is fast and induces little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> loss. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s are trapped in a two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al optical lattice that enables cycles of compress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to increase the density, followed by Raman sideband cooling to decrease the temperature. From a starting number of 2000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, 1400 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s reach quantum degeneracy in 300 milliseconds, as confirmed by a bimodal velocity distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The method should be broadly applicable to many bosonic and ferm<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic species and to systems where evaporative cooling is not possible.</p>

Large-amplitude transfer motion of hydrated excess protons mapped by ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy
<p>Solvat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and transport of excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s in aqueous systems play a fundamental role in acid-base chemistry and biochemical processes. We mapped ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> excurs<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> transfer coordinate by means of two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al infrared spectroscopy, both in bulk water and in a Zundel cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sup>+</sup> motif selectively prepared in acetonitrile. Electric fields from the environment and stochastic hydrogen bond mot<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s induce fluctuat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> double-minimum potential.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nuclei</span></strong> move centripetally toward the midplane of the leaf blade; thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nuclei</span></strong> on both the adaxial and abaxial sides become posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ed at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ing implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. Here, we show that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) and ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Two mutants defective in the posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nuclei</span></strong> in the dark were isolated and designated as <i>unusual nuclear posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ing1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) and <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nuclei</span></strong> of <i>unp1</i> were posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ed at the anticlinal walls of adaxial and abaxial mesophyll cells and abaxial pavement cells, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nuclei</span></strong> of <i>unp2</i> were posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ed at the anticlinal walls of mesophyll and pavement cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a dominant-negative mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>ACTIN7</i>, and <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>AN</i>. Actin filaments in <i>unp1</i> were fragmented and reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, and plant growth. The mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>AN</i> caused aberrant posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nuclei</span></strong>-associated actin filaments at the anticlinal walls. AN was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>ally with plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) and itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-propanone significantly inhibited dark-induced nuclear posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ing. Collectively, these results suggest that the AN-DYRKP complex regulates the alignment of actin filaments during centripetal nuclear posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ing in leaf cells.</p>

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells

Dynamic multinuclear sites formed by mobilized copper ions in NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> selective catalytic reduction

We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair.

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration
<p>Nanoporous two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al materials are attractive for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic and molecular nanofiltrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> but limited by insufficient mechanical strength over large areas. We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water molecules while blocking solute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s or molecules to enable size-selective separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The SWNT network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>ally separates the GNM into microsized islands and acts as the microscopic framework to support the GNM, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically thin GNM. The resulting GNM/SWNT membranes show high water permeance and a high reject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> ratio for salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s or organic molecules, and they retain stable separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> performance in tubular modules.</p>

Complete steric exclusion of ions and proton transport through confined monolayer water
<p>It has long been an aspirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al goal to create artificial structures that allow fast permeat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of water but reject even the smallest hydrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, replicating the feat achieved by nature in protein channels (e.g., aquaporins). Despite recent progress in creating nanoscale pores and capillaries, these structures still remain distinctly larger than protein channels. We report capillaries made by effectively extracting one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic plane from bulk crystals, which leaves a two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al slit of a few angstroms in height. Water moves through these capillaries with little resistance, whereas no permeat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> could be detected even for such small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s as Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>. Only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s (H<sup>+</sup>) can diffuse through monolayer water inside the capillaries. These observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s improve our understanding of molecular transport at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic scale.</p>

Illuminating gravitational waves: A concordant picture of photons from a neutron star merger
<p>Merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> stars offer an excellent laboratory for simultaneously studying strong-field gravity and matter in extreme environments. We establish the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al associat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of an electromagnetic counterpart (EM170817) with gravitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al waves (GW170817) detected from merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> stars. By synthesizing a panchromatic data set, we demonstrate that merging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> stars are a long-sought product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> site forging heavy elements by r-process nucleosynthesis. The weak gamma rays seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-ray bursts with ultrarelativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet explains the low-luminosity gamma rays, the high-luminosity ultraviolet-optical-infrared, and the delayed radio and x-ray emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We posit that all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star mergers may lead to a wide-angle cocoon breakout, sometimes accompanied by a successful jet and sometimes by a choked jet.</p>

A precise measurement of the magnetic field in the corona of the black hole binary V404 Cygni
<p>Observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of binary stars containing an accreting black hole or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star often show x-ray emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> extending to high energies (>10 kilo­–electron volts), which is ascribed to an accret<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disk corona of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">energetic particl</span></strong>es akin to those seen in the solar corona. Despite their ubiquity, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>al condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in accret<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disk coronae remain poorly constrained.

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s approaching the size of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and water molecules. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic plane from a bulk crystal. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, molecular separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

The Rydberg constant and proton size from atomic hydrogen
<p>At the core of the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> radius puzzle” is a four–standard deviat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> discrepancy between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> root-mean-square charge radii (<i>r</i><sub>p</sub>) determined from the regular hydrogen (H) and the muonic hydrogen (µp) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. Using a cryogenic beam of H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s, we measured the 2S-4P transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> frequency in H, yielding the values of the Rydberg constant <i>R</i><sub>∞</sub> = 10973731.568076(96) per meter<sup></sup>and <i>r</i><sub>p</sub> = 0.8335(95) femtometer. Our <i>r</i><sub>p</sub> value is 3.3 combined standard deviat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s smaller than the previous H world data, but in good agreement with the µp value.

Synthesis of FeH<sub>5</sub>: A layered structure with atomic hydrogen slabs
<p>High pressure promotes the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of polyhydrides with unusually high hydrogen-to-metal ratios.

We synthesized iron pentahydride (FeH<sub>5</sub>) by a direct react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> between iron and H<sub>2</sub> above 130 gigapascals in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. FeH<sub>5</sub> exhibits a structure built of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic hydrogen only.

Quantized thermal transport in single-atom junctions
<p>Thermal transport in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic junct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and chains is of great fundamental interest because of the distinctive quantum effects expected to arise in them. By using novel, custom-fabricated, picowatt-resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> calorimetric scanning probes, we measured the thermal conductance of gold and platinum metallic wires down to single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> junct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Our work reveals that the thermal conductance of gold single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> junct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s is quantized at room temperature and shows that the Wiedemann-Franz law relating thermal and electrical conductance is satisfied even in single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> contacts. Furthermore, we quantitatively explain our experimental results within the Landauer framework for quantum thermal transport. The experimental techniques reported here will enable thermal transport studies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic and molecular chains, which will be key to investigating numerous fundamental issues that thus far have remained experimentally inaccessible.</p>

An atom-by-atom assembler of defect-free arbitrary two-dimensional atomic arrays
<p>Large arrays of individually controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s trapped in optical tweezers are a very promising platform for quantum engineering applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. However, deterministic loading of the traps is experimentally challenging.

<p>On 17 August 2017, gravitat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al waves (GWs) were detected from a binary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the eject<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong>-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> star mergers play a role in rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neutron</span></strong> capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

Atomic model for the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> region of mitochondrial ATP synthase
<p>Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase produces the majority of ATP in eukaryotic cells, and its dimerizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is necessary to create the inner membrane folds, or cristae, characteristic of mitochondria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> translocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> through the membrane-embedded F<sub>O</sub> reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> turns the rotor that drives ATP synthesis in the soluble F<sub>1</sub> reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Although crystal structures of the F<sub>1</sub> reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> have illustrated how this rotat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> leads to ATP synthesis, understanding how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong> translocat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> produces the rotat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> has been impeded by the lack of an experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic model for the F<sub>O</sub> reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we determined the structure of the dimeric F<sub>O</sub> complex from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> at a resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of 3.6 angstroms. The structure clarifies how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proton</span></strong>s travel through the complex, how the complex dimerizes, and how the dimers bend the membrane to produce cristae.</p>

Angular momentum–induced delays in solid-state photoemission enhanced by intra-atomic interactions
<p>Attosecond time-resolved photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy reveals that photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from solids is not yet fully understood. The relative emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> delays between four photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels measured for the van der Waals crystal tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) can only be explained by accounting for both propagat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic delays. The intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic delay depends on the angular momentum of the initial localized state and is determined by intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. For the studied case of WSe<sub>2</sub>, the photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> events are time ordered with rising initial-state angular momentum. Including intra-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic electron-electron interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and angular momentum of the initial localized state yields excellent agreement between theory and experiment. This has required a revis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of existing models for solid-state photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and thus, attosecond time-resolved photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from solids provides important benchmarks for improved future photoemiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> models.</p>

Xenon isotopes in 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko show that comets contributed to Earth's atmosphere

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing metallic hydrogen has been a great challenge in condensed matter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s. Metallic hydrogen may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, hydrogen becomes metallic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-electron model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 electron volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding electron carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic density. The properties are those of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic metal. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington dissociative transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic metallic hydrogen in the laboratory.</p>

Hydrogen positions in single nanocrystals revealed by electron diffraction
<p>The localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s is an essential part of crystal structure analysis, but it is difficult because of their small scattering power. We report the direct localizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in nanocrystalline materials, achieved using the recently developed approach of dynamical refinement of precess<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> electron diffract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> tomography data. We used this method to locate hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in both an organic (paracetamol) and an inorganic (framework cobalt aluminophosphate) material. The results demonstrate that the technique can reliably reveal fine structural details, including the posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s in single crystals with micro- to nanosized dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Single-molecule optomechanics in “picocavities”
<p>Trapping light with noble metal nanostructures overcomes the diffract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> limit and can confine light to volumes typically on the order of 30 cubic nanometers. We found that individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features inside the gap of a plasmonic nanoassembly can localize light to volumes well below 1 cubic nanometer (“picocavities”), enabling optical experiments on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic scale. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic features are dynamically formed and disassembled by laser irradiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Although unstable at room temperature, picocavities can be stabilized at cryogenic temperatures, allowing single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic cavities to be probed for many minutes. Unlike tradit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al optomechanical resonators, such extreme optical confinement yields a factor of 10<sup>6</sup> enhancement of optomechanical coupling between the picocavity field and vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of individual molecular bonds. This work sets the basis for developing nanoscale nonlinear quantum optics on the single-molecule level.</p>

Realization of two-dimensional spin-orbit coupling for Bose-Einstein condensates

Real-space imaging of molecular structure and chemical bonding by single-molecule inelastic tunneling probe

The scanning tunneling microscope can provide electronic and vibrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al signatures of single molecules.

Edge Nonlinear Optics on a MoS<sub>2</sub> Atomic Monolayer
<sec><title>Optics On the Edge</title><p>The ability to isolate stable materials just one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong> thick has provided the impetus for a new generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of thin films technologies. Often, the materials are conceptually imaged in the form of an artist's impress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> as single continuous layers—a single crystal sheet of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. Scanning probe and transmiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> electron microscopies reveal the reality, however, where the material resembles a patchwork quilt with polycrystals of different orientat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and size separated by grain boundaries forming a mosaic.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s on transpirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> but also by photosynthetic react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, probably as a consequence of NADPH format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e can be used to assess plant performance under different growing condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

High-temperature pairing in a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas

We used spatially resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure pairing energy of ferm<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s across a wide range of temperatures and interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> strengths in a two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al gas of ultracold ferm<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>s. We observed many-body pairing at temperatures far above the critical temperature for superfluidity. In the strongly interacting regime, the pairing energy in the normal phase considerably exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing in this regime is driven by many-body correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, rather than two-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s. Our findings show that pairing correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in strongly interacting two-dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al ferm<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ic systems are remarkably robust against thermal fluctuat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

We compiled a global data set for carbon and helium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>es from volcanic arcs and demonstrated that the carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of mean global volcanic gas is considerably heavier, at –3.8 to –4.6 per mil (‰), than the canonical mid-ocean ridge basalt value of –6.0‰. The largest volcanic emitters outgas carbon with higher δ<sup>13</sup>C and are located in mature continental arcs that have accreted carbonate platforms, indicating that reworking of crustal limestone is an important source of volcanic carbon. The fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al burial of organic carbon is lower than tradit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally determined from a global carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e mass balance and may have varied over geological time, modulated by supercontinent format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and breakup.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s and engineering asserts that any type of system, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">atom</span></strong>ic and optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">physic</span></strong>s but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

Tungsten-182 heterogeneity in modern ocean island basalts
<p>New tungsten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e data for modern ocean island basalts (OIB) from Hawaii, Samoa, and Iceland reveal variable <sup>182</sup>W/<sup>184</sup>W, ranging from that of the ambient upper mantle to ratios as much as 18 parts per mill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> lower. The tungsten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic data negatively correlate with <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He. These data indicate that each OIB system accesses domains within Earth that formed within the first 60 mill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> years of solar system history. Combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic and chemical characteristics projected for these ancient domains indicate that they contain metal and are repositories of noble gases. We suggest that the most likely source candidates are mega–ultralow-velocity zones, which lie beneath Hawaii, Samoa, and Iceland but not beneath hot spots whose OIB yield normal <sup>182</sup>W and homogeneously low <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He.</p>

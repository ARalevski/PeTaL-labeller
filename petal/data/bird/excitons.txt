Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlations enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “coherent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray diffraction tracks the light-induced femtosecond coherent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent coherent changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon interactions.</p>

Full momentum- and energy-resolved spectral function of a 2D electronic system
<p>The single-particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong>l function measures the density of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic states in a material as a function of both momentum and energy, providing central insights into strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> phenomena. Here we demonstrate a high-resolution method for measuring the full momentum- and energy-resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong>l function of a two-dimensional (2D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic system embedded in a semiconductor. The technique remains operational in the presence of large externally applied magnetic fields and functions even for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic systems with zero electrical conductivity or with zero <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> density. Using the technique on a prototypical 2D system, a GaAs quantum well, we uncover signatures of many-body effects involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon interactions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>s, polarons, and a phonon analog of the vacuum Rabi splitting in atomic systems.</p>

Tuning quantum nonlocal effects in graphene plasmonics
<p>The response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> systems to electrodynamic fields that change rapidly in space is endowed by unique features, including an exquisite spatial nonlocality. This can reveal much about the materials’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure that is invisible in standard probes that use gradually varying fields. Here, we use graphene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>s, propagating at extremely slow velocities close to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> Fermi velocity, to probe the nonlocal response of the graphene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> liquid. The near-field imaging experiments reveal a parameter-free match with the full quantum description of the massless Dirac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> gas, which involves three types of nonlocal quantum effects: single-particle velocity matching, interaction-enhanced Fermi velocity, and interaction-reduced compressibility. Our experimental approach can determine the full spatiotemporal response of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> system.</p>

Electron-scale dynamics of the diffusion region during symmetric magnetic reconnection in space
<p>Magnetic reconnection is an energy conversion process that occurs in many astrophysical contexts including Earth’s magnetosphere, where the process can be investigated in situ by spacecraft. On 11 July 2017, the four Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft encountered a reconnection site in Earth’s magnetotail, where reconnection involves symmetric inflow conditions. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-scale plasma measurements revealed (i) super-Alfvénic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> jets reaching 15,000 kilometers per second; (ii) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> meandering motion and acceleration by the electric field, producing multiple crescent-shaped structures in the velocity distributions; and (iii) the spatial dimensions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> diffusion region with an aspect ratio of 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with fast reconnection. The well-structured multiple layers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> populations indicate that the dominant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> dynamics are mostly laminar, despite the presence of turbulence near the reconnection site.</p>

Quantifying hot carrier and thermal contributions in plasmonic photocatalysis
<p>Photocatalysis based on optically active, “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>ic” metal nanoparticles has emerged as a promising approach to facilitate light-driven chemical conversions under far milder conditions than thermal catalysis. However, an understanding of the relation between thermal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic excitations has been lacking. We report the substantial light-induced reduction of the thermal activation barrier for ammonia decomposition on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>ic photocatalyst. We introduce the concept of a light-dependent activation barrier to account for the effect of light illumination on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic and thermal excitations in a single unified picture. This framework provides insight into the specific role of hot carriers in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>-mediated photochemistry, which is critically important for designing energy-efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>ic photocatalysts.</p>

Imaging of nonlocal hot-electron energy dissipation via shot noise
<p>In modern micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic devices, hot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s accelerate, scatter, and dissipate energy in nanoscale dimensions. Despite recent progress in nanothermometry, direct real-space mapping of hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> energy dissipation is challenging because existing techniques are restricted to probing the lattice rather than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s. We realize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic nanothermometry by measuring local current fluctuations, or shot noise, associated with ultrafast hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> kinetic processes (~21 terahertz). Exploiting a scanning and contact-free tungsten tip as a local noise probe, we directly visualize hot-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> distributions before their thermal equilibration with the host gallium arsenide/aluminium gallium arsenide crystal lattice. With nanoconstriction devices, we reveal unexpected nonlocal energy dissipation at room temperature, which is reminiscent of ballistic transport of low-temperature quantum conductors.</p>

Ballistic miniband conduction in a graphene superlattice
<p>Rational design of long-period artificial lattices yields effects unavailable in simple solids. The moiré pattern in highly aligned graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) heterostructures is a lateral superlattice with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> mobility and an unusual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic dispersion whose miniband edges and saddle points can be reached by electrostatic gating. We investigated the dynamics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s in moiré minibands by measuring ballistic transport between adjacent local contacts in a magnetic field, known as the transverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> focusing effect. At low temperatures, we observed caustics of skipping orbits extending over hundreds of superlattice periods, reversals of the cyclotron revolution for successive minibands, and breakdown of cyclotron motion near van Hove singularities. At high temperatures, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> collisions suppress focusing. Probing such miniband conduction properties is a necessity for engineering novel transport behaviors in superlattice devices.</p>

The Impacts of Phosphorus Deficiency on the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain
<p>Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and P deficiency limits plant productivity. Recent work showed that P deficiency affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport to photosystem I (PSI), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive biological model describing how P deficiency disrupts the photosynthetic machinery and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport chain through a series of sequential events in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). P deficiency reduces the orthophosphate concentration in the chloroplast stroma to levels that inhibit ATP synthase activity. Consequently, protons accumulate in the thylakoids and cause lumen acidification, which inhibits linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow. Limited plastoquinol oxidation retards <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport to the cytochrome <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transfer rate of PSI is increased under steady-state growth light and is limited under high-light conditions. Under P deficiency, the enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow through PSI increases the levels of NADPH, whereas ATP production remains restricted and, hence, reduces CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. In parallel, lumen acidification activates the energy-dependent quenching component of the nonphotochemical quenching mechanism and prevents the overexcitation of photosystem II and damage to the leaf tissue. Consequently, plants can be severely affected by P deficiency for weeks without displaying any visual leaf symptoms. All of the processes in the photosynthetic machinery influenced by P deficiency appear to be fully reversible and can be restored in less than 60 min after resupply of orthophosphate to the leaf tissue.</p>

Identification of site-specific isotopic labels by vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope

Photonic crystals for nano-light in moiré graphene superlattices
<p>Graphene is an atomically thin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>ic medium that supports highly confined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> polaritons, or nano-light, with very low loss. Electronic properties of graphene can be drastically altered when it is laid upon another graphene layer, resulting in a moiré superlattice. The relative twist angle between the two layers is a key tuning parameter of the interlayer coupling in thus-obtained twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). We studied the propagation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> polaritons in TBG by infrared nano-imaging. We discovered that the atomic reconstruction occurring at small twist angles transforms the TBG into a natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> photonic crystal for propagating nano-light. This discovery points to a pathway for controlling nano-light by exploiting quantum properties of graphene and other atomically layered van der Waals materials, eliminating the need for arduous top-down nanofabrication.</p>

Real-space and real-time observation of a plasmon-induced chemical reaction of a single molecule

However, the mechanism remains controversial because of the difficulty of direct observation of the chemical reactions in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>ic field, which is strongly localized near the metal surface. We used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to achieve real-space and real-time observation of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>-induced chemical reaction at the single-molecule level. A single dimethyl disulfide molecule on silver and copper surfaces was dissociated by the optically excited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> at the STM junction.

Signatures of exciton condensation in a transition metal dichalcogenide
<p>Bose condensation has shaped our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors, atomic gases, and liquid helium. Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to condense into either a superfluid or an insulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic crystal. Using the recently developed technique of momentum‐resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> energy‐loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic collective modes in the transition metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1<i>T</i>‐TiSe<sub>2</sub>. Near the phase-transition temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of the valence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s into an exciton condensate. Our study provides compelling evidence for exciton condensation in a three-dimensional solid and establishes M-EELS as a versatile technique sensitive to valence band excitations in quantum materials.</p>

Attosecond-resolved photoionization of chiral molecules
<p>Chiral light-matter interactions have been investigated for two centuries, leading to the discovery of many chiroptical processes used for discrimination of enantiomers. Whereas most chiroptical effects result from a response of bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s, photoionization can produce much stronger chiral signals that manifest as asymmetries in the angular distribution of the photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s along the light-propagation axis. We implemented self-referenced attosecond photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> interferometry to measure the temporal profile of the forward and backward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets emitted upon photoionization of camphor by circularly polarized laser pulses. We measured a delay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s ejected forward and backward, which depends on the ejection angle and reaches 24 attoseconds. The asymmetric temporal shape of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets emitted through an autoionizing state further reveals the chiral character of strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic dynamics.</p>

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid
<p>Charge ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s in solids crystallize into a periodic pattern of charge-rich and charge-poor sites owing to strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In geometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic state without long-range CO has been observed. We found that a charge-ordered organic material with an isosceles triangular lattice shows charge dynamics associated with crystallization and vitrification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s, which can be understood in the context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO patterns. The dynamics suggest that the same nucleation and growth processes that characterize conventional glass-forming liquids guide the crystallization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s. These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of the liquid-glass transition.</p>

Electronic crystal growth

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The dynamics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of wave packets. However, the rapidity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> dynamics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets in the time domain. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong>lly resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packet created through a Fano autoionizing resonance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference wave packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant wave packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing resonance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission dynamics governed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlation, as well as coherent control over structured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> wave packets.</p>

PGR5-Dependent Cyclic Electron Flow Protects Photosystem I under Fluctuating Light at Donor and Acceptor Sides
<p>In response to a sudden increase in light intensity, plants must cope with absorbed excess photon energy to protect photosystems from photodamage. Under fluctuating light, PSI is severely photodamaged in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>proton gradient regulation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutant defective in the main pathway of PSI cyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport (CET). Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed regulatory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) reservation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> sink capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH production ratio (acceptor-side regulation) and (2) down-regulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic control for slowing down the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> flow toward PSI (donor-side regulation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> backgrounds by introducing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hypersensitivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to luminal acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic control partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant background but restricted linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic control should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> sink and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic control. Thus, donor-side regulation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side regulation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side regulation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport and that an excess capacity for alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport.</p>

Rapid change of superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling through critical doping in Bi-2212
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-boson coupling plays a key role in superconductivity for many systems. However, in copper-based high–critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) superconductors, its relation to superconductivity remains controversial despite strong spectroscopic fingerprints. In this study, we used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to find a pronounced correlation between the superconducting gap and the bosonic coupling strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+δ</sub>. The bosonic coupling strength rapidly increases from the overdoped Fermi liquid regime to the optimally doped strange metal, concomitant with the quadrupled superconducting gap and the doubled gap-to-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ratio across the pseudogap boundary. This synchronized lattice and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic response suggests that the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic interaction and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon coupling (EPC) reinforce each other in a positive-feedback loop upon entering the strange-metal regime, which in turn drives a stronger superconductivity.</p>

Twistable electronics with dynamically rotatable heterostructures

Probing the ultimate plasmon confinement limits with a van der Waals heterostructure
<p>The ability to confine light into tiny spatial dimensions is important for applications such as microscopy, sensing, and nanoscale lasers. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong>s offer an appealing avenue to confine light, Landau damping in metals imposes a trade-off between optical field confinement and losses. We show that a graphene-insulator-metal heterostructure can overcome that trade-off, and demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> confinement down to the ultimate limit of the length scale of one atom. This is achieved through far-field excitation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plasmon</span></strong> modes squeezed into an atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride dielectric spacer between graphene and metal rods. A theoretical model that takes into account the nonlocal optical response of both graphene and metal is used to describe the results.

Bottom-up synthesis of multifunctional nanoporous graphene
<p>Nanosize pores can turn semimetallic graphene into a semiconductor and, from being impermeable, into the most efficient molecular-sieve membrane. However, scaling the pores down to the nanometer, while fulfilling the tight structural constraints imposed by applications, represents an enormous challenge for present top-down strategies. Here we report a bottom-up method to synthesize nanoporous graphene comprising an ordered array of pores separated by ribbons, which can be tuned down to the 1-nanometer range. The size, density, morphology, and chemical composition of the pores are defined with atomic precision by the design of the molecular precursors. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic characterization further reveals a highly anisotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure, where orthogonal one-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic bands with an energy gap of ∼1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> volt coexist with confined pore states, making the nanoporous graphene a highly versatile semiconductor for simultaneous sieving and electrical sensing of molecular species.</p>

Strong spin-photon coupling in silicon
<p>Long coherence times of single spins in silicon quantum dots make these systems highly attractive for quantum computation, but how to scale up spin qubit systems remains an open question. As a first step to address this issue, we demonstrate the strong coupling of a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> spin and a single microwave photon. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave photon is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric field component of the cavity photon couples directly to the charge dipole of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> in the double dot, and indirectly to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> spin, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet. Our results provide a route to realizing large networks of quantum dot–based spin qubit registers.</p>

Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy of electron beam–sensitive crystalline materials
<p>High-resolution imaging of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> beam–sensitive materials is one of the most difficult applications of transmission <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> microscopy (TEM). The challenges are manifold, including the acquisition of images with extremely low beam doses, the time-constrained search for crystal zone axes, the precise image alignment, and the accurate determination of the defocus value. We develop a suite of methods to fulfill these requirements and acquire atomic-resolution TEM images of several metal organic frameworks that are generally recognized as highly sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> beams. The high image resolution allows us to identify individual metal atomic columns, various types of surface termination, and benzene rings in the organic linkers. We also apply our methods to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> beam–sensitive materials, including the organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>.</p>

Enantioselective photochemistry through Lewis acid–catalyzed triplet energy transfer
<p>Relatively few catalytic systems are able to control the stereochemistry of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ically excited organic intermediates. Here we report the discovery that a chiral Lewis acid complex can catalyze triplet energy transfer from an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ically excited photosensitizer. We applied this strategy to asymmetric [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of 2′-hydroxychalcones, using tris(bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) as a sensitizer. A variety of electrochemical, computational, and spectroscopic data rule out substrate activation by means of photoinduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transfer and instead support a mechanism in which Lewis acid coordination dramatically lowers the triplet energy of the chalcone substrate. We expect that this approach will enable chemists to more broadly apply their detailed understanding of chiral Lewis acid catalysis to stereocontrol in reactions involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ically excited states.</p>

Observing the ultrafast buildup of a Fano resonance in the time domain
<p>Although the time-dependent buildup of asymmetric Fano line shapes in absorption <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> has been of great theoretical interest in the past decade, experimental verification of the predictions has been elusive. Here, we report the experimental observation of the emergence of a Fano resonance in the prototype system of helium by interrupting the autoionization process of a correlated two-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> excited state with a strong laser field. The tunable temporal gate between excitation and termination of the resonance allows us to follow the formation of a Fano line shape in time. The agreement with ab initio calculations validates our experimental time-gating technique for addressing an even broader range of topics, such as the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> correlation, the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-internuclear coupling, and quasi-particle formation.</p>

Glycolate Induces Redox Tuning Of Photosystem II in Vivo: Study of a Photorespiration Mutant
<p>Bicarbonate removal from the nonheme iron at the acceptor side of photosystem II (PSII) was shown recently to shift the midpoint potential of the primary quinone acceptor Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive potential and lowers the yield of singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) production. The presence of Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup> results in weaker binding of bicarbonate, suggesting a redox-based regulatory and protective mechanism where loss of bicarbonate or exchange of bicarbonate by other small carboxylic acids may protect PSII against <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in vivo under photorespiratory conditions. Here, we compared the properties of Q<sub>A</sub> in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) photorespiration mutant deficient in peroxisomal HYDROXYPYRUVATE REDUCTASE1 (<i>hpr1-1</i>), which accumulates glycolate in leaves, with the wild type. Photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport was affected in the mutant, and chlorophyll fluorescence showed slower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport between Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub> in the mutant. Glycolate induced an increase in the temperature maximum of thermoluminescence emission, indicating a shift of the midpoint potential of Q<sub>A</sub> to a more positive value. The yield of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production was lowered in thylakoid membranes isolated from <i>hpr1-1</i> compared with the wild type, consistent with a higher potential of Q<sub>A</sub>/Q<sub>A</sub><sup>−</sup>. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> donation to photosystem I was affected in <i>hpr1-1</i> at higher light intensities, consistent with diminished <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transfer out of PSII. This study indicates that replacement of bicarbonate at the nonheme iron by a small carboxylate anion occurs in plants in vivo. These findings suggested that replacement of the bicarbonate on the nonheme iron by glycolate may represent a regulatory mechanism that protects PSII against photooxidative stress under low-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p>

Ferredoxin:NADP(H) Oxidoreductase Abundance and Location Influences Redox Poise and Stress Tolerance
<p>In linear photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport, ferredoxin:NADP(H) oxidoreductase (FNR) transfers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s from ferredoxin (Fd) to NADP<sup>+</sup>. Both NADPH and reduced Fd (Fd<sup>red</sup>) are required for reductive assimilation and light/dark activation/deactivation of enzymes. FNR is therefore a hub, connecting photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport to chloroplast redox metabolism. A correlation between FNR content and tolerance to oxidative stress is well established, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the impact of altered FNR content and localization on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> transport and superoxide radical evolution in isolated thylakoids, and probed resulting changes in redox homeostasis, expression of oxidative stress markers, and tolerance to high light in planta. Our data indicate that the ratio of Fd<sup>red</sup> to FNR is critical, with either too much or too little FNR potentially leading to increased superoxide production, and perception of oxidative stress at the level of gene transcription. In FNR overexpressing plants, which show more NADP(H) and glutathione pools, improved tolerance to high-light stress indicates that disturbance of chloroplast redox poise and increased free radical generation may help “prime” the plant and induce protective mechanisms. In <i>fnr1</i> knock-outs, the NADP(H) and glutathione pools are more oxidized relative to the wild type, and the photoprotective effect is absent despite perception of oxidative stress at the level of gene transcription.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Genome-Wide Biases in the Rate and Molecular Spectrum of Spontaneous Mutations in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> and <i>Vibrio fischeri</i>
<p>The vast diversity in nucleotide composition and architecture among bacterial genomes may be partly explained by inherent biases in the rates and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> of spontaneous mutations. Bacterial genomes with multiple chromosomes are relatively unusual but some are relevant to human health, none more so than the causative agent of cholera, <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Here, we present the genome-wide mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> in wild-type and mismatch repair (MMR) defective backgrounds of two <i>Vibrio</i> species, the low-%GC squid symbiont <i>V. fischeri</i> and the pathogen <i>V. cholerae</i>, collected under conditions that greatly minimize the efficiency of natural selection. In apparent contrast to their high diversity in nature, both wild-type <i>V. fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have among the lowest rates for base-substitution mutations (bpsms) and insertion–deletion mutations (indels) that have been measured, below 10<sup>−</sup><sup>3</sup>/genome/generation. <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and <i>V. cholerae</i> have distinct mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong>, but both are AT-biased and produce a surprising number of multi-nucleotide indels. Furthermore, the loss of a functional MMR system caused the mutation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> of these species to converge, implying that the MMR system itself contributes to species-specific mutation patterns. Bpsm and indel rates varied among genome regions, but do not explain the more rapid evolutionary rates of genes on chromosome 2, which likely result from weaker purifying selection. More generally, the very low mutation rates of <i>Vibrio</i> species correlate inversely with their immense population sizes and suggest that selection may not only have maximized replication fidelity but also optimized other polygenic traits relative to the constraints of genetic drift.</p>

Coherent band excitations in CePd<sub>3</sub>: A comparison of neutron scattering and ab initio theory
<p>In common with many strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> systems, intermediate valence compounds are believed to display a crossover from a high-temperature regime of incoherently fluctuating local moments to a low-temperature regime of coherent hybridized bands. We show that inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of CePd<sub>3</sub> provides a benchmark for ab initio calculations based on dynamical mean field theory. The magnetic response is strongly momentum dependent thanks to the formation of coherent f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> bands at low temperature, with an amplitude that is strongly enhanced by local particle-hole interactions. The agreement between experiment and theory shows that we have a robust first-principles understanding of the temperature dependence of f-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> coherence.</p>

Imaging resonant dissipation from individual atomic defects in graphene
<p>Conversion of electric current into heat involves microscopic processes that operate on nanometer length scales and release minute amounts of power.

Using scanning nanothermometry with submicrokelvin sensitivity, we visualized and controlled phonon emission from individual atomic-scale defects in graphene. The inferred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>-phonon “cooling power spectrum” exhibits sharp peaks when the Fermi level comes into resonance with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic quasi-bound states at such defects.

Femtosecond x-ray spectroscopy of an electrocyclic ring-opening reaction
<p>The ultrafast light-activated electrocyclic ring-opening reaction of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a fundamental prototype of photochemical pericyclic reactions. Generally, these reactions are thought to proceed through an intermediate excited-state minimum (the so-called pericyclic minimum), which leads to isomerization via nonadiabatic relaxation to the ground state of the photoproduct. Here, we used femtosecond (fs) soft x-ray spectroscopy near the carbon K-edge (~284 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> volts) on a table-top apparatus to directly reveal the valence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure of this transient intermediate state. The core-to-valence spectroscopic signature of the pericyclic minimum observed in the experiment was characterized, in combination with time-dependent density functional theory calculations, to reveal overlap and mixing of the frontier valence orbital energy levels. We show that this transient valence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic structure arises within 60 ± 20 fs after ultraviolet photoexcitation and decays with a time constant of 110 ± 60 fs.</p>

Observation of the Wigner-Huntington transition to metallic hydrogen
<p>Producing metallic hydrogen has been a great challenge in condensed matter physics. Metallic hydrogen may be a room-temperature superconductor and metastable when the pressure is released and could have an important impact on energy and rocketry. We have studied solid molecular hydrogen under pressure at low temperatures. At a pressure of 495 gigapascals, hydrogen becomes metallic, with reflectivity as high as 0.91. We fit the reflectance using a Drude free-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> model to determine the plasma frequency of 32.5 ± 2.1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> volts at a temperature of 5.5 kelvin, with a corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> carrier density of 7.7 ± 1.1 × 10<sup>23</sup> particles per cubic centimeter, which is consistent with theoretical estimates of the atomic density. The properties are those of an atomic metal. We have produced the Wigner-Huntington dissociative transition to atomic metallic hydrogen in the laboratory.</p>

Anomalously low electronic thermal conductivity in metallic vanadium dioxide
<p>In electrically conductive solids, the Wiedemann-Franz law requires the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic contribution to thermal conductivity to be proportional to electrical conductivity. Violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law are typically an indication of unconventional quasiparticle dynamics, such as inelastic scattering, or hydrodynamic collective motion of charge carriers, typically pronounced only at cryogenic temperatures. We report an order-of-magnitude breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law at high temperatures ranging from 240 to 340 kelvin in metallic vanadium dioxide in the vicinity of its metal-insulator transition. Different from previously established mechanisms, the unusually low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic thermal conductivity is a signature of the absence of quasiparticles in a strongly correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> fluid where heat and charge diffuse independently.</p>

Time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy with a water window high-harmonic source
<p>Time-resolved x-ray absorption spectroscopy (TR-XAS) has so far practically been limited to large-scale facilities, to subpicosecond temporal resolution, and to the condensed phase. We report the realization of TR-XAS with a temporal resolution in the low femtosecond range by developing a tabletop high-harmonic source reaching up to 350 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> volts, thus partially covering the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong>l region of 280 to 530 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> volts, where water is transmissive. We used this source to follow previously unexamined light-induced chemical reactions in the lowest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>ic states of isolated CF<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and SF<sub>6</sub><sup>+</sup> molecules in the gas phase. By probing element-specific core-to-valence transitions at the carbon K-edge or the sulfur L-edges, we characterized their reaction paths and observed the effect of symmetry breaking through the splitting of absorption bands and Rydberg-valence mixing induced by the geometry changes.</p>

Strong coupling of a single electron in silicon to a microwave photon
<p>Silicon is vital to the computing industry because of the high quality of its native oxide and well-established doping technologies. Isotopic purification has enabled quantum coherence times on the order of seconds, thereby placing silicon at the forefront of efforts to create a solid-state quantum processor. We demonstrate strong coupling of a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> in a silicon double quantum dot to the photonic field of a microwave cavity, as shown by the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting. Strong coupling of a quantum dot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> to a cavity photon would allow for long-range qubit coupling and the long-range entanglement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong>s in semiconductor quantum dots.</p>

Density functional theory is straying from the path toward the exact functional
<p>The theorems at the core of density functional theory (DFT) state that the energy of a many-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> system in its ground state is fully defined by its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> density distribution. This connection is made via the exact functional for the energy, which minimizes at the exact density. For years, DFT development focused on energies, implicitly assuming that functionals producing better energies become better approximations of the exact functional. We examined the other side of the coin: the energy-minimizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electron</span></strong> densities for atomic species, as produced by 128 historical and modern DFT functionals. We found that these densities became closer to the exact ones, reflecting theoretical advances, until the early 2000s, when this trend was reversed by unconstrained functionals sacrificing physical rigor for the flexibility of empirical fitting.</p>

Microresonator soliton dual-comb spectroscopy
<p>Measurement of optical and vibrational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> with high resolution provides a way to identify chemical species in cluttered environments and is of general importance in many fields. Dual-comb spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful approach for acquiring nearly instantaneous Raman and optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> with unprecedented resolution. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong> are generated directly in the electrical domain, without the need for bulky mechanical spectrometers. We demonstrate a miniature soliton-based dual-comb system that can potentially transfer the approach to a chip platform. These devices achieve high-coherence pulsed mode locking. They also feature broad, reproducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spectra</span></strong>l envelopes, an essential feature for dual-comb spectroscopy. Our work shows the potential for integrated spectroscopy with high signal-to-noise ratios and fast acquisition rates.</p>

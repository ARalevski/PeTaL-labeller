Distribution of Estimated 10-Year Risk of Recurrent Vascular Events and Residual Risk in a Secondary Prevention Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Among patients with clinically manifest vascular disease, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of recurrent vascular events is likely to vary. We assessed the distribution of estimated 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of recurrent vascular events in a secondary prevention population. We also estimated the potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction and residual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> that can be achieved if patients reach guideline-recommended <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The SMART score (Second Manifestations of Arterial Disease) for 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death was applied to 6904 patients with vascular disease. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score was externally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated in 18 436 patients with various manifestations of vascular disease from the TNT (Treating to New Targets), IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels), and CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of Ischemic Events) trials. The residual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> at guideline-recommended targets was estimated by applying relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions from meta-analyses to the estimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for targets for systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, and use of antithrombotic agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The external performance of the SMART <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score was reasonable, apart from overestimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in patients with 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> >40%. In patients with various manifestations of vascular disease, median 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of a recurrent major vascular event was 17% (interquartile range, 11%–28%), varying from <10% in 18% to >30% in 22% of the patients. If <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors were at guideline-recommended targets, the residual 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> would be <10% in 47% and >30% in 9% of the patients (median, 11%; interquartile range, 7%–17%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with vascular disease, there is very substantial variation in estimated 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of recurrent vascular events. If all modifiable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors were at guideline-recommended targets, half of the patients would have a 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> <10%. These data suggest that even with optimal treatment, many patients with vascular disease will remain at >20% and even >30% 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, clearly delineating an area of substantial unmet medical need.</p></sec>

Genetic Predisposition, Clinical Risk Factor Burden, and Lifetime Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The long-term probability of developing atrial fibrillation (AF) considering genetic predisposition and clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor burden is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We estimated the lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF in individuals from the community-based Framingham Heart Study. Polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for AF was derived using a score of ≈1000 AF-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor burden was calculated for each individual using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score for incident AF comprised of height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, current smoking status, antihypertensive medication use, diabetes mellitus, history of myocardial infarction, and history of heart failure. We estimated the lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF within tertiles of polygenic and clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 4606 participants without AF at 55 years of age, 580 developed incident AF (median follow-up, 9.4 years; 25th–75th percentile, 4.4–14.3 years). The lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF >55 years of age was 37.1% and was substantially influenced by both polygenic and clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor burden. Among individuals free of AF at 55 years of age, those in low-polygenic and clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> tertiles had a lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of AF of 22.3% (95% confidence interval, 15.4−9.1), whereas those in high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> tertiles had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of 48.2% (95% confidence interval, 41.3−55.1).

Modeling Major Adverse Outcomes of Pediatric and Adult Patients With Congenital Heart Disease Undergoing Cardiac Catheterization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> standardization for adverse events after congenital cardiac catheterization is needed to equitably compare patient outcomes among different hospitals as a foundation for quality improvement. The goal of this project was to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>-standardization methodology to adjust for patient characteristics when comparing major adverse outcomes in the NCDR’s (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) IMPACT Registry (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between January 2011 and March 2014, 39 725 consecutive patients within IMPACT undergoing cardiac catheterization were identified. Given the heterogeneity of interventional procedures for congenital heart disease, new procedure-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> categories were derived with empirical data and expert opinion, as were markers of hemodynamic vulnerability. A multivariable hierarchical logistic regression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> to identify patient and procedural characteristics predictive of a major adverse event or death after cardiac catheterization was derived in 70% of the cohort and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated in the remaining 30%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rate of major adverse event or death was 7.1% and 7.2% in the derivation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ation cohorts, respectively. Six procedure-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> categories and 6 independent indicators of hemodynamic vulnerability were identified. The final <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> adjustment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> included procedure-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> category, number of hemodynamic vulnerability indicators, renal insufficiency, single-ventricle physiology, and coagulation disorder.

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of bleeding. Although empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s have been developed to predict such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ estimates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011. Empirical stroke and bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s were assessed by using the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS<sub>2</sub>) and Anticoagulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) scores, respectively. Separately, physicians were asked to categorize their patients’ stroke and bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s: low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (<3%); intermediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (3%–6%); and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (>6%). Overall, 72% (n=7251) in ORBIT-AF had high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores (≥2). However, only 16% were assessed as high stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (score ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians. The associations between empirical and physician-estimated stroke and bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s were low (weighted Kappa 0.1 and 0.11, respectively). Physicians weighed hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus less significantly than empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s in estimating stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>; physicians weighted anemia and dialysis less significantly than empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s when estimating bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s. Anticoagulation use was highest among patients with high stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, assessed by either empirical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> or physician estimates.

Oral Anticoagulation in Very Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants (OACs) is the cornerstone for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data about the use of OACs among patients ≥90 years of age are limited. We aimed to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the net clinical benefit of OAC treatment for very elderly patients with AF (≥90 years of age).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of ischemic stroke and ICH were compared between 11 064 and 14 658 patients with and without AF ≥90 years of age without antithrombotic therapy from 1996 to 2011. Patients with AF (n=15 756) were divided into 3 groups (no treatment, antiplatelet agents, and warfarin), and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of stroke and ICH were analyzed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of ischemic stroke and ICH were further compared between patients treated with warfarin and nonvitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) from 2012 to 2015 when NOACs were available in Taiwan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with patients without AF, patients with AF had an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic stroke (event number/patient number, incidence = 742/11 064, 5.75%/y versus 1399/14 658, 3.00%/y; hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.74–2.14) and similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ICH (131/11 064, 0.97%/y versus 206/14 658, 0.54%/y; hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.09) in competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> analysis for mortality. Among patients with AF, warfarin use was associated with a lower stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (39/617, 3.83%/y versus 742/11 064, 5.75%/y; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.96 in a competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>), with no difference in ICH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> compared with nontreatment.

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates adult lipid measures.

Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Subgroup With Higher Burden of Atherosclerosis and Greater Relative Benefit From Statin Therapy in the Primary Prevention Setting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction with statin therapy has been consistent across nearly all subgroups studied to date. However, in analyses of 2 randomized controlled primary prevention trials (ASCOT [Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Lipid-Lowering Arm] and JUPITER [Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin]), statin therapy led to a greater relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction among a subgroup at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. Here, we aimed to confirm this observation in a third primary prevention randomized controlled trial. In addition, we assessed whether those at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> had a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants from a randomized controlled trial of primary prevention with statin therapy (WOSCOPS [West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study]; n=4910) and 2 observational cohort studies (CARDIA [Coronary Artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Development in Young Adults] and BioImage; n=1154 and 4392, respectively). For each participant, we calculated a polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score derived from up to 57 common DNA sequence variants previously associated with coronary heart disease. We compared the relative efficacy of statin therapy in those at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (top quintile of polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score) versus all others (WOSCOPS), as well as the association between the polygenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score and coronary artery calcification (CARDIA) and carotid artery plaque burden (BioImage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among WOSCOPS trial participants at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, statin therapy was associated with a relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction of 44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22–60; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas in all others, the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction was 24% (95% CI, 8–37; <i>P</i>=0.004) despite similar low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. In a study-level meta-analysis across the WOSCOPS, ASCOT, and JUPITER primary prevention, relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reduction in those at high genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was 46% versus 26% in all others (<i>P</i> for heterogeneity=0.05).

Analyses to define <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors and to build a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction equation were developed, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction equation was tested for its ability to discriminate patients who experience incident ASCVD from those who did not over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We recruited 2404 adult patients with FH who were followed up for a mean of 5.5 years (SD, 3.2 years), during which 12 (0.5%) and 122 (5.1%) suffered fatal and nonfatal incident ASCVD, respectively. Age, male sex, history of previous ASCVD, high blood pressure, increased body mass index, active smoking, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) levels were independent predictors of incident ASCVD from which a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> equation with a Harrell C index of 0.85 was derived. The bootstrap resampling (100 randomized samples) of the original set for internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ation showed a degree of overoptimism of 0.003. Individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was estimated for each person without an established diagnosis of ASCVD before enrollment in the registry by use of the SAFEHEART <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> equation, the modified Framingham <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> equation, and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD Pooled Cohort <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Equations. The Harrell C index for these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s was 0.81, 0.78, and 0.8, respectively, and differences between the SAFEHEART <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> equation and the other 2 were significant (<i>P</i>=0.023 and <i>P</i>=0.045).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident ASCVD may be estimated in patients with FH with simple clinical predictors.

Female Sex Is a Risk Modifier Rather Than a Risk Factor for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in atrial fibrillation is assessed by using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score. Sex category (Sc, ie, female sex) confers 1 point on CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc. We hypothesized that female sex is a stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> modifier, rather than an overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor, when added to a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA (sex-independent thromboembolism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>) score scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using 3 nationwide registries, we identified patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2015. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant treatment at baseline were excluded, and person-time was censored at the time of treatment initiation (if any). CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were calculated for men and women, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was a primary hospital code for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (thromboembolism). We calculated crude event rates for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> strata as events per 100 person-years. For quantifying absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of stroke, we calculated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s based on the pseudovalue method. Female sex as a prognostic factor was investigated by inclusion as an interaction term on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score to calculate the thromboembolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> ratio for different score points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 239 671 patients with atrial fibrillation (48.7% women) contributed to the analyses. The mean ages for women and men were 76.6 years and 70.3 years, respectively; the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were 2.7 for women and 2.3 for men. The overall 1-year thromboembolic rate per 100 person-years for women was 7.3 and 5.7 for men. The 1-year absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of thromboembolism was 0.5% among men and women with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score of 0 and increased up to >7% among very comorbid patients (score >5). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> ratio (male as reference) across points >1 indicated that women exhibit a higher stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. The interaction was statistically significant (<i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Female sex is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> modifier for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Initial decisions on oral anticoagulant treatment could be guided by a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score (ie, excluding the sex category criterion), but the Sc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> component modifies and accentuates stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in women who would have been eligible for oral anticoagulant treatment on the basis of ≥2 additional stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors.</p></sec>

Derivation and Validation of the CREST Model for Very Early Prediction of Circulatory Etiology Death in Patients Without ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction After Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>No practical tool quantitates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of circulatory-etiology death (CED) immediately after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients without ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction.

Genetic Risk Prediction of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) has a substantial genetic basis. Identification of individuals at greatest AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> could minimize the incidence of cardioembolic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To determine whether genetic data can stratify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for development of AF, we examined associations between AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores and incident AF in 5 prospective studies comprising 18 919 individuals of European ancestry. We examined associations between AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents. Scores were based on 11 to 719 common variants (≥5%) associated with AF at <i>P</i> values ranging from <1×10<sup>−3</sup> to <1×10<sup>−8</sup> in a prior independent genetic association study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Incident AF occurred in 1032 individuals (5.5%). AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores were associated with new-onset AF after adjustment for clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. The pooled hazard ratio for incident AF for the highest versus lowest quartile of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores ranged from 1.28 (719 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.46; <i>P</i>=1.5×10<sup>−4</sup>) to 1.67 (25 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–1.90; <i>P</i>=9.3×10<sup>−15</sup>). Discrimination of combined clinical and genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores varied across studies and scores (maximum C statistic, 0.629–0.811; maximum ΔC statistic from clinical score alone, 0.009–0.017). AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was associated with stroke in age- and sex-adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s. For example, individuals in the highest versus lowest quartile of a 127-variant score had a 2.49-fold increased odds of cardioembolic stroke (95% confidence interval, 1.39–4.58; <i>P</i>=2.7×10<sup>−3</sup>). The effect persisted after the exclusion of individuals (n=70) with known AF (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–4.40; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Comprehensive AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores were associated with incident AF beyond associations for clinical AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors but offered small improvements in discrimination. AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was also associated with cardioembolic stroke in age- and sex-adjusted analyses. Efforts are warranted to determine whether AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> may improve identification of subclinical AF or help distinguish between stroke mechanisms.</p></sec>

This is the largest-ever cohort study to evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among long-term survivors of teenage and young adult cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The population-based TYACSS (Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study) (N=178,962) was linked to Hospital Episode Statistics data for England to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event among 5-year survivors of cancer diagnosed when 15 to 39 years of age. Observed numbers of first hospitalizations for cerebrovascular events were compared with that expected from the general population using standardized hospitalization ratios (SHRs) and absolute excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s per 10 000 person-years. Cumulative incidence was calculated with death considered a competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 2782 cancer survivors were hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event—40% higher than expected (SHR=1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.3–1.4). Survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors (SHR=4.6, 95% confidence interval, 4.3–5.0), head and neck tumors (SHR=2.6, 95% confidence interval, 2.2–3.1), and leukemia (SHR=2.5, 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.1) were at greatest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.

By 60 years of age, 9%, 6%, and 5% of CNS tumor, head and neck tumor, and leukemia survivors, respectively, had been hospitalized for a cerebrovascular event. Beyond 60 years of age, every year, 0.4% of CNS tumor survivors were hospitalized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.1% expected), whereas at any age, every year, 0.2% of head and neck tumor survivors were hospitalized for a cerebral infarction (versus 0.06% expected).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Survivors of a CNS tumor, head and neck tumor, and leukemia are particularly at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of hospitalization for a cerebrovascular event.

Sex Differences and Similarities in Atrial Fibrillation Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Mortality in Community Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac disease in aging populations with high comorbidity and mortality. Sex differences in AF epidemiology are insufficiently understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In N=79 793 individuals without AF diagnosis at baseline (median age, 49.6 years; age range, 24.1–97.6 years; 51.7% women) from 4 community-based European studies (FIN<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, DanMONICA, Moli-sani Northern Sweden) of the BiomarCaRE consortium (Biomarker for Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Assessment in Europe), we examined AF incidence, its association with mortality, common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, biomarkers, and prevalent cardiovascular disease, and their attributable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> by sex. Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were observed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was similar (>30%) for both sexes. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of death in comparison with those without AF. Multivariable-adjusted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s showed sex differences for the association of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio per standard deviation increase, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.23 in women versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25–1.38 in men; interaction <i>P</i> value of 0.001).

Systematic Biology
Statistical Inference of Allopolyploid Species Networks in the Presence of Incomplete Lineage Sorting
<p>Polyploidy is an important speciation mechanism, particularly in land plants. Allopolyploid species are formed after hybridization between otherwise intersterile parental species. Recent theoretical progress has led to successful implementation of species tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s that take population genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parameter</span></strong>s into account. However, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s have not included allopolyploid hybridization and the special problems imposed when species trees of allopolyploids are inferred. Here, 2 new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s for the statistical inference of the evolutionary history of allopolyploids are evaluated using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>ations and demonstrated on 2 empirical data sets. It is assumed that there has been a single hybridization event between 2 diploid species resulting in a genomic allotetraploid. The evolutionary history can be represented as a species network or as a multilabeled species tree, in which some pairs of tips are labeled with the same species. In one of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s (AlloppMUL), the multilabeled species tree is inferred directly. This is the simplest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> and the most widely applicable, since fewer assumptions are made. The second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> (AlloppNET) incorporates the hybridization event explicitly which means that fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parameter</span></strong>s need to be estimated. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are implemented in the BEAST framework. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>ations show that both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are useful and that AlloppNET is more accurate if the assumptions it is based on are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are demonstrated on previously analyzed data from the genera <i>Pachycladon</i> (Brassicaceae) and <i>Silene</i> (Caryophyllaceae).

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to compare the efficacy of two agents,   aspirin and warfarin, for the prevention of venous thromboembolism   (VTE) after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>taneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (SBTKA),   and to elucidate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of VTE conferred by this procedure compared   with unilateral TKA (UTKA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective, multi-institutional study was conducted on 18   951 patients, 3685 who underwent SBTKA and 15 266 who underwent   UTKA, using aspirin or warfarin as VTE prophylaxis. Each patient   was assigned an individualised baseline VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score based on   a system using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Symptomatic VTE,   including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT),   were identified in the first 90 days post-operatively. Statistical   analyses were performed with logistic regression accounting for   baseline VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The adjusted incidence of PE following SBTKA was 1.0% (95% confidence   interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.2) with aspirin and 2.2% (95% CI 2.0 to   2.4) with warfarin. Similarly, the adjusted incidence of VTE following   SBTKA was 1.6% (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) with aspirin and 2.5% (95% CI   1.9 to 3.3) with warfarin. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PE and VTE were reduced by   66% (odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78) and 38% (OR 0.62,   95% CI 0.38 to 1.0), respectively, using aspirin. In addition, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>   of PE was 204% higher for patients undergoing SBTKA relative to   those undergoing UTKA. For each ten-point increase in baseline VTE   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PE increased by 25.5% for patients undergoing   SBTKA compared with 10.5% for those undergoing UTKA. Patients with   a history of myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular disease had   the greatest increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> from undergoing SBTKA instead of UTKA.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Aspirin is more effective than warfarin for the prevention of   VTE following SBTKA, and serves as the more appropriate agent for   VTE prophylaxis for patients in all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> categories. Furthermore,   patients undergoing SBTKA are at a substantially increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>   of VTE, even more so for those with significant underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>   factors. Patients should be informed about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s associated   with undergoing SBTKA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B(1   Supple A):68–75.</p></sec>

Association of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and Risk of Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the development of peripheral artery disease (PAD) remains unclear. We investigated whether HIV infection is associated with an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PAD after adjustment for traditional atherosclerotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in a large cohort of HIV-infected (HIV+) and demographically similar HIV-uninfected veterans.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study from April 1, 2003 through December 31, 2014. We excluded participants with known prior PAD or prevalent cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary heart disease, and congestive heart failure) and analyzed the effect of HIV status on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident PAD events after adjusting for demographics, PAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, substance use, CD4 cell count, HIV-1 ribonucleic acid, and antiretroviral therapy. The primary outcome is incident peripheral artery disease events. Secondary outcomes include mortality and amputation in subjects with incident PAD events by HIV infection status, viral load, and CD4 count.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 91 953 participants, over a median follow up of 9.0 years, there were 7708 incident PAD events. Rates of incident PAD events per 1000 person-years were higher among HIV+ (11.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.5–12.4) than uninfected veterans (9.9; 95% CI, 9.6–10.1). After adjustment for demographics, PAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, and other covariates, HIV+ veterans had an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident PAD events compared with uninfected veterans (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.25). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was highest among those with time-updated HIV viral load >500 copies/mL (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.38–1.65) and CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.71–2.13). In contrast, HIV+ veterans with time updated CD4 cell count ≥500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> had no increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PAD (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.96–1.11). Mortality rates after incident PAD events are high regardless of HIV status. HIV infection did not affect rates of amputation after incident PAD events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Infection with HIV is associated with a 19% increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PAD beyond that explained by traditional atherosclerotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. However, for those with sustained CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident PAD events is nearly 2-fold higher whereas for those with sustained CD4 cell counts ≥500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> there is no excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident PAD events compared with uninfected people.</p></sec>

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We recently identified 156 proteins in human plasma that were each associated with the net Framingham Cardiovascular Disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Score using an aptamer-based proteomic platform in Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants. Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 proteins might identify genetic determinants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of genetic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular Disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Score–associated proteins using linear mixed-effects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s in 2 population-based cohorts. We performed discovery analyses on plasma samples from 759 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, an observational study of the offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated these findings in plasma samples from 1421 participants of the MDCS (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study). To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular disease pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> system to experimentally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipoprotein E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-protein associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously. These loci explained up to 66% of interindividual plasma protein-level variation and, on average, accounted for 3 times the amount of variation explained by common clinical factors, such as age, sex, and diabetes mellitus status. We described overlap among many of these loci and cardiovascular disease genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> variants. Finally, we experimentally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated a novel association between circulating apolipoprotein E levels and the transcription factor phosphatase 1G. Knockdown of phosphatase 1G in a human liver cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> resulted in decreased apolipoprotein E transcription and apolipoprotein E protein levels in cultured supernatants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified dozens of novel genetic determinants of proteins associated with the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Score and experimentally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated a new role for phosphatase 1G in lipoprotein biology.

The outcome of the surgical treatment of pelvic chondrosarcomas
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few studies dealing with chondrosarcoma of the pelvis are currently   available. Different data about the overall survival and prognostic   factors have been published but without a detailed analysis of surgery-related complications.   We aimed to analyse the outcome of a series of pelvic chondrosarcomas   treated at a single institution, with particular attention to the   prognostic factors. Based on a competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, our objective   was to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors for the development of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a retrospective single-centre study, 58 chondrosarcomas (26   patients alive, 32 patients dead) of the pelvis were reviewed. The   mean follow-up was 13 years (one week to 23.1 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 26 patients (45%) were alive and 32 patients (55%)   had died. Overall survival was 76%, 55% and 45% at one, five and   ten years post-operatively, respectively. In a competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>   the cumulative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of the development of a surgery-related complication   was 64% at six months and 69% at one year, post-operatively, respectively.   Endoprosthetic reconstruction was a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor for   the development of complications (p = 0.006). Complications were   not significantly related to age or the location or grade of the   tumour (p = 0.823, p = 0.976, p = 0.858). The development of complications   did not have a negative effect on survival (p = 0.147).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study with competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> analysis of surgery-related   complications in patients with a pelvic chondrosarcoma.

Value of Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification for Risk Prediction of Coronary and Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Computed tomography (CT) allows estimation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. We evaluated several progression algorithms in our unselected, population-based cohort for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction of coronary and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 3281 participants (45–74 years of age), free from cardiovascular disease until the second visit, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, and CTs at baseline (b) and after a mean of 5.1 years (5y) were measured. Hard coronary and cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events including revascularization, as well, were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8±2.2 years after the second CT. The added predictive value of 10 CAC progression algorithms on top of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors including baseline CAC was evaluated by using survival analysis, C-statistics, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination index. A subgroup analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in CAC categories was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed 85 (2.6%) hard coronary, 161 (4.9%) hard cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for hard/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive value of baseline CT and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> assessment in terms of C-statistic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and hard/total cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively. When CAC<sub>b</sub> progressed from 1 to 399 to CAC<sub>5y</sub>≥400, coronary and total cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> were nearly 2-fold in comparison with subjects who remained below CAC<sub>5y</sub>=400. Participants with CAC<sub>b</sub>≥400 had high rates of hard coronary and hard/total cardiovascular events (10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>: 12.0%, 13.5%, and 30.9%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CAC progression is associated with coronary and cardiovascular event rates, but adds only weakly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction. What counts is the most recent CAC value and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor assessment. Therefore, a repeat scan >5 years after the first scan may be of additional value, except when a double-zero CT scan is present or when the subjects are already at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Genetic Predisposition to High Blood Pressure and Lifestyle Factors

We scored participants according to their lifestyle factors including body mass index, healthy diet, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol consumption, smoking, and urinary sodium excretion levels measured at recruitment. We examined the association between tertiles of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> and tertiles of lifestyle score with BP levels and incident CVD by using linear regression and Cox regression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Healthy lifestyle score was strongly associated with BP (<i>P</i><10<sup>–320</sup>) for systolic and diastolic BP and CVD events regardless of the underlying BP genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.

At the index age of 45 years, the lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for any HF through 90 years of age was higher in men than women (27.4% versus 23.8%). Among HF subtypes, the lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for HFrEF was higher in men than women (10.6% versus 5.8%).

Population-Based Long-Term Cardiac-Specific Mortality Among 34 489 Five-Year Survivors of Childhood Cancer in Great Britain
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of cardiac morbidity and mortality among childhood cancer survivors have been described previously.

We investigated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of long-term cardiac mortality among survivors within the recently extended British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a population-based cohort of 34 489 five-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed from 1940 to 2006 and followed up until February 28, 2014, and is the largest cohort to date to assess late cardiac mortality. Standardized mortality ratios and absolute excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s were used to quantify cardiac mortality excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. Multivariable Poisson regression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s were used to evaluate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>taneous effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors.

Among those >60 years of age, subsequent primary neoplasms, cardiac disease, and other circulatory conditions accounted for 31%, 22%, and 15% of all excess deaths, respectively, providing clear focus for preventive interventions. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of both overall cardiac and cardiomyopathy/heart failure mortality was greatest among those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989.

Echocardiographic Screening for Rheumatic Heart Disease in High and Low Risk Australian Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Echocardiographic screening for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is becoming more widespread, but screening studies to date have used different echocardiographic definitions.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>ating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of stomatal behavior with a biochemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parameter</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

SLiM 2: Flexible, Interactive Forward Genetic Simulations
<p>Modern population genomic datasets hold immense promise for revealing the evolutionary processes operating in natural populations, but a crucial prerequisite for this goal is the ability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> realistic evolutionary scenarios and predict their expected patterns in genomic data. To that end, we present SLiM 2: an evolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>ation framework that combines a powerful, fast engine for forward population genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>ations with the capability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing a wide variety of complex evolutionary scenarios. SLiM achieves this flexibility through scriptability, which provides control over most aspects of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>ated evolutionary scenarios with a simple R-like scripting language called Eidos. An example SLiM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>ation is presented to illustrate the power of this approach. SLiM 2 also includes a graphical user interface for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>ation construction, interactive runtime control, and dynamic visualization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>ation output, facilitating easy and fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> development with quick prototyping and visual debugging. We conclude with a performance comparison between SLiM and two other popular forward genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>ation packages.</p>

Inflammatory and Cholesterol Risk in the FOURIER Trial

It is not known whether the efficacy of evolocumab is modified by baseline inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. We explored the efficacy of evolocumab stratified by baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). We also assessed the importance of inflammatory and residual cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> across the range of on-treatment LDL-C concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients (n=27 564) with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL on a statin were randomly assigned to evolocumab versus placebo and followed for a median of 2.2 years (1.8–2.5). The effects of evolocumab on the primary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization, and the key secondary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were compared across strata of baseline hsCRP (<1, 1–3, and >3 mg/dL). Outcomes were also assessed across values for baseline hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C in the entire trial population. Multivariable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s adjusted for variables associated with hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 7981 (29%) patients had a baseline hsCRP<1 mg/L, 11 177 (41%) had a hsCRP 1 to 3 mg/L, and 8337 (30%) had a hsCRP >3 mg/L. Median (interquartile range) baseline hsCRP was 1.8 (0.9–3.6) mg/L and levels were not altered by evolocumab (change at 48 weeks of –0.2 mg/dL [–1.0 to 0.4] in both treatment arms). In the placebo arm, patients in higher baseline hsCRP categories experienced significantly higher 3-year Kaplan-Meier rates of the primary and key secondary end points: 12.0%, 13.7%, and 18.1% for the primary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) and 7.4%, 9.1%, and 13.2% for the key secondary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) for categories of <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/dL, respectively. The relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions for the primary end point and key secondary end point with evolocumab were consistent across hsCRP strata (<i>P</i>-interactions>0.15 for both).

Frequency, Predictors, and Impact of Combined Antiplatelet Therapy on Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Symptomatic Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies suggest that symptomatic atherosclerosis may be associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Prior randomized studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in recurrent VTE with aspirin monotherapy. Whether VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> is associated with more severe symptomatic atherosclerosis and more intensive antiplatelet therapy reduces VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> beyond aspirin monotherapy is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRA2P-TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) (vorapaxar) and PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) (ticagrelor) were blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trials of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of ischemic events in stable patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis. Two blinded vascular specialists systematically identified symptomatic venous thromboembolic events in both trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 47 611 patients with stable vascular disease followed for 3 years in both studies there were 343 VTE events in 301 patients (Kaplan-Meier rate at 3 years, 0.9% for placebo). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of VTE was independently associated with age, body mass index, polyvascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancy. The burden of atherosclerosis manifested as an increasing number of symptomatic vascular territories was associated with a graded increase in the 3-year rates of VTE (0.76% for 1, 1.53% for 2, and 2.45% for 3 territories). More intensive antiplatelet therapy (vorapaxar and ticagrelor pooled) significantly reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of VTE by 29% compared with background antiplatelet therapy, from 0.93% to 0.64% at 3 years (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The rate of VTE in patients with atherosclerosis is ≈0.3% per year while on treatment with ≥1 antiplatelet agent, with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> independently associated with the number of symptomatic vascular territories.

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development. We have retrospectively applied large-scale proteomics to blood samples from ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events), a trial of torcetrapib (a cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor), that involved 15 067 participants at high cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. ILLUMINATE was terminated at a median of 550 days because of significant absolute increases of 1.2% in cardiovascular events and 0.4% in mortality with torcetrapib. The aims of our analysis were to determine whether a proteomic analysis might reveal biological mechanisms responsible for these harmful effects and whether harmful effects of torcetrapib could have been detected early in the ILLUMINATE trial with proteomics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A nested case-control analysis of paired plasma samples at baseline and at 3 months was performed in 249 participants assigned to torcetrapib plus atorvastatin and 223 participants assigned to atorvastatin only. Within each treatment arm, cases with events were matched to controls 1:1. Main outcomes were a survey of 1129 proteins for discovery of biological pathways altered by torcetrapib and a 9-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated to predict myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Plasma concentrations of 200 proteins changed significantly with torcetrapib.

Temporal Trends in Adverse Events After Everolimus-Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold Versus Everolimus-Eluting Metallic Stent Implantation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Bioresorbable coronary stents have been introduced into clinical practice to improve the outcomes of patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. The everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) is the most studied of these stent platforms; however, recent trials comparing BVS with everolimus-eluting metallic stents (EES) raised concerns about BVS safety. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of BVS versus EES in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, scientific sessions abstracts, and relevant Web sites for randomized trials with a follow-up of ≥2 years investigating percutaneous coronary interventions with BVS versus EES. The primary outcomes of our analysis were definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST) and target lesion failure (TLF; device-oriented composite end point of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, or ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization [TLR]). Secondary outcomes were target vessel myocardial infarction, TLR, and cardiac death. We calculated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> estimates for main outcomes according to a fixed-effect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 7 trials comprising data for 5583 patients randomized to receive either a BVS (n=3261) or an EES (n=2322). Median follow-up was 24 months (range, 24–36 months). Patients treated with BVS had a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of definite/probable ST compared with patients treated with EES (odds ratio, 3.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.97–5.62; <i>P</i><0.00001). In particular, patients with BVS had a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of subacute, late, and very late ST, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of acute ST was similar. Patients treated with BVS compared with EES had a higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> at 2 years of TLF (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.90; <i>P</i>=0.003), driven mainly by an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of target vessel myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.28; <i>P</i>=0.0001; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%) and of TLR (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–1.62; <i>P</i>=0.05).

Association of Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors With Venous Thromboembolism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Much controversy surrounds the association of traditional cardiovascular disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors with venous thromboembolism (VTE).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an individual level random-effect meta-analysis including 9 prospective studies with measured baseline cardiovascular disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ated VTE events. Definitions were harmonized across studies. Traditional cardiovascular disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ed categorically and continuously using restricted cubic splines. Estimates were obtained for overall VTE, provoked VTE (ie, VTE occurring in the presence of 1 or more established VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors), and unprovoked VTE, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The studies included 244 865 participants with 4910 VTE events occurring during a mean follow-up of 4.7 to 19.7 years per study. Age, sex, and body mass index-adjusted hazard ratios for overall VTE were 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89−1.07) for hypertension, 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88−1.08) for hyperlipidemia, 1.01 (95% CI: 0.89−1.15) for diabetes mellitus, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.08−1.32) for current smoking. After full adjustment, these estimates were numerically similar. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ed continuously, an inverse association was observed for systolic blood pressure (hazard ratio=0.79 [95% CI: 0.68−0.92] at systolic blood pressure 160 vs 110 mm Hg) but not for diastolic blood pressure or lipid measures with VTE. An important finding from VTE subtype analyses was that cigarette smoking was associated with provoked but not unprovoked VTE. Fully adjusted hazard ratios for the associations of current smoking with provoked and unprovoked VTE were 1.36 (95% CI: 1.22−1.52) and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.90−1.29), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Except for the association between cigarette smoking and provoked VTE, which is potentially mediated through comorbid conditions such as cancer, the modifiable traditional cardiovascular disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors are not associated with increased VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. Higher systolic blood pressure showed an inverse association with VTE.</p></sec>

Plasma Lipidomic Profiles Improve on Traditional Risk Factors for the Prediction of Cardiovascular Events in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical lipid measurements do not show the full complexity of the altered lipid metabolism associated with diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease. Lipidomics enables the assessment of hundreds of lipid species as potential markers for disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Plasma lipid species (310) were measured by a targeted lipidomic analysis with liquid chromatography electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry on a case-cohort (n=3779) subset from the ADVANCE trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron-MR Controlled Evaluation). The case-cohort was 61% male with a mean age of 67 years. All participants had type 2 diabetes mellitus with ≥1 additional cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, and 35% had a history of macrovascular disease.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy
<p>Process-based crop growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s are popular tools with which to analyze and understand the impact of crop management, genotype-by-environment interactions, or climate change. The ability to predict leaf area development is critical to predict crop growth, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering growth coordination rules between wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant organs (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and sheaths, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> the dynamics of canopy development. We found a unique relationship between laminae area and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and sheath areas also were found, highlighting the tight control of organ growth within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to develop a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>ation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of leaf area dynamics at the canopy level that was integrated in the wheat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> SiriusQuality. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> accurately predicts leaf area dynamics under different scenarios of nitrogen and water limitations. It accounted for 85%, 64%, and 73% of the variability of the surface area of leaf cohorts, total leaf area index, and total green area index, respectively. The process-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of the dynamics of leaf area described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on wheat growth.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Detecting Adaptation in Protein-Coding Genes Using a Bayesian Site-Heterogeneous Mutation-Selection Codon Substitution Model
<p>Codon substitution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s have traditionally attempted to uncover signatures of adaptation within protein-coding genes by contrasting the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. Another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing approach, known as the mutation–selection framework, attempts to explicitly account for selective patterns at the amino acid level, with some approaches allowing for heterogeneity in these patterns across codon sites. Under such a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, substitutions at a given position occur at the neutral or nearly neutral rate when they are synonymous, or when they correspond to replacements between amino acids of similar fitness; substitutions from high to low (low to high) fitness amino acids have comparatively low (high) rates. Here, we study the use of such a mutation–selection framework as a null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> for the detection of adaptation. Following previous works in this direction, we include a deviation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">parameter</span></strong> that has the effect of capturing the surplus, or deficit, in non-synonymous rates, relative to what would be expected under a mutation–selection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing framework that includes a Dirichlet process approach to account for across-codon-site variation in amino acid fitness profiles. We use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">simul</span></strong>ations, along with a few real data sets, to study the behavior of the approach, and find it to have good power with a low false-positive rate. Altogether, we emphasize the potential of recent mutation–selection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s in the detection of adaptation, calling for further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> refinements as well as large-scale applications.</p>

Derivation and Validation of a Novel Right-Sided Heart Failure Model After Implantation of Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The aim of the study was to derive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ate a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score for early right-sided heart failure (RHF) after left ventricular assist device implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The EUROMACS (European Registry for Patients with Mechanical Circulatory Support) was used to identify adult patients undergoing continuous-flow left ventricular assist device implantation with mainstream devices. Eligible patients (n=2988) were randomly divided into derivation (n=2000) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ation (n=988) cohorts. The primary outcome was early (<30 days) severe postoperative RHF, defined as receiving short- or long-term right-sided circulatory support, continuous inotropic support for ≥14 days, or nitric oxide ventilation for ≥48 hours. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit. Covariates found to be associated with RHF (exploratory univariate <i>P</i><0.10) were entered into a multivariable logistic regression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score was then generated using the relative magnitude of the exponential regression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> coefficients of independent predictors at the last step after checking for collinearity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">likelihood ratio</span></strong> test, c index, and clinical weight at each step.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A 9.5-point <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score incorporating 5 variables (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support class, use of multiple inotropes, severe right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography, ratio of right atrial/pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, hemoglobin) was created. The mean scores in the derivation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valid</span></strong>ation cohorts were 2.7±1.9 and 2.6±2.0, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.32). RHF in the derivation cohort occurred in 433 patients (21.7%) after left ventricular assist device implantation and was associated with a lower 1-year (53% versus 71%; <i>P</i><0.001) and 2-year (45% versus 58%; <i>P</i><0.001) survival compared with patients without RHF. RHF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> ranged from 11% (low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score 0–2) to 43.1% (high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score >4; <i>P</i><0.0001).

Cardiovascular Outcomes and Risks After Initiation of a Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical trials have shown cardiovascular benefits and potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s from sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Trials may have limited ability to address individual end points or safety concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a population-based cohort study among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease newly initiated on antihyperglycemic agents within the US Department of Defense Military Health System between April 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016. Incidence rates, hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for time to first composite end point of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure event, major adverse cardiovascular events (defined as all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke), and individual end points were evaluated using conditional Cox <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s comparing new SGLT2i users with other antihyperglycemic agents. The exploratory safety end point was below-knee lower extremity amputation.

Coronary Plaque Characterization in Psoriasis Reveals High-Risk Features That Improve After Treatment in a Prospective Observational Study
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory disease associated with an accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of myocardial infarction, provides an ideal human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> to study inflammatory atherogenesis in vivo. We hypothesized that the increased cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> observed in psoriasis would be partially attributable to an elevated subclinical coronary artery disease burden composed of noncalcified plaques with high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> features. However, inadequate efforts have been made to directly measure coronary artery disease in this vulnerable population. As such, we sought to compare total coronary plaque burden and noncalcified coronary plaque burden (NCB) and high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> plaque (HRP) prevalence between patients with psoriasis (n=105), patients with hyperlipidemia eligible for statin therapy under National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (n=100) who were ≈10 years older, and healthy volunteers without psoriasis (n=25).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients underwent coronary computed-tomography angiography for total coronary plaque burden and NCB quantification and HRP identification, defined as low attenuation (<30 hounsfield units), positive re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing (>1.10), and spotty calcification. A consecutive sample of the first 50 patients with psoriasis was scanned again 1 year after therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Despite being younger and at lower traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> than patients with hyperlipidemia, patients with psoriasis had increased NCB (mean±SD: 1.18±0.33 versus 1.11±0.32, <i>P</i>=0.02) and similar HRP prevalence (<i>P</i>=0.58). Furthermore, compared to healthy volunteers, patients with psoriasis had increased total coronary plaque burden (1.22±0.31 versus 1.04±0.22, <i>P</i>=0.001), NCB (1.18±0.33 versus 1.03±0.21, <i>P</i>=0.004), and HRP prevalence beyond traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (odds ratio, 6.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–31.7; <i>P</i>=0.03). Last, among patients with psoriasis followed for 1 year, improvement in psoriasis severity was associated with improvement in total coronary plaque burden (β=0.45, 0.23–0.67; <i>P</i><0.001) and NCB (β=0.53, 0.32–0.74; <i>P</i><0.001) beyond traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Patients with psoriasis had greater NCB and increased HRP prevalence than healthy volunteers. In addition, patients with psoriasis had elevated NCB and equivalent HRP prevalence as older patients with hyperlipidemia.

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of long-term side effects limit the success of existing therapeutic agents. Although Tspan12 has been shown to regulate retinal vascular development, nothing is known about its involvement in neovascular disease and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rodent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s of retinal neovascular disease, including the mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of oxygen-induced retinopathy and the very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> were analyzed for Tspan/β-catenin regulation. Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12. Therapeutic effects of the newly developed Ab on vascular endothelial cells were tested in vitro and in vivo in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The newly developed anti-Tspan12 Ab exhibited potent inhibitory effects on endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the Ab inhibited the interaction between Tspan12 and Frizzled-4 and effectively modulates β-catenin levels and target genes in vascular endothelial cells. Tspan12/β-catenin signaling was activated in response to acute and chronic stress in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor mouse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal application of the Ab showed significant therapeutic effects in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>s without inducing negative side effects on retina function. Moreover, combined intravitreal injection of the Ab with a known vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, Aflibercept, resulted in significant enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of each monotherapy.

The Optimal Timing of Stage 2 Palliation for Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome

The effect of the timing of stage 2 palliation (S2P), a physician-modifiable factor, on long-term survival is not well understood.

Transplant-free survival (TFS) was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ed from (1) Norwood to S2P and (2) S2P to 3 years by using parametric hazard analysis. Factors associated with death or heart transplantation were determined for each interval. To account for staged procedures, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood TFS (the probability of TFS at 3 years given survival to S2P) was calculated using parametric conditional survival analysis. TFS from the Norwood to S2P was first predicted. TFS after S2P to 3 years was then predicted and adjusted for attrition before S2P by multiplying by the estimate of TFS to S2P. The optimal timing of S2P was determined by generating nomograms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>-adjusted, 3-year, post-Norwood, TFS versus the interval from the Norwood to S2P.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 547 included patients, 399 survived to S2P (73%). Of the survivors to S2P, 349 (87%) survived to 3-year follow-up. The median interval from the Norwood to S2P was 5.1 (interquartile range, 4.1–6.0) months. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>-adjusted, 3-year, TFS was 68±7%. A Norwood-S2P interval of 3 to 6 months was associated with greatest 3-year TFS overall and in patients with few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. In patients with multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, TFS was severely compromised, regardless of the timing of S2P and most severely when S2P was performed early. No difference in the optimal timing of S2P existed when stratified by shunt type.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In infants with few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, progressing to S2P at 3 to 6 months after the Norwood procedure was associated with maximal TFS. Early S2P did not rescue patients with greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor burdens. Instead, referral for heart transplantation may offer their best chance at long-term survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>ing, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart disease, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

Multimodality Strategy for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> assessment among adults without known CVD are limited by suboptimal performance and a narrow focus on only atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). We hypothesized that a strategy combining promising biomarkers across multiple different testing modalities would improve global and atherosclerotic CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> assessment among individuals without known CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) (n=6621) and the Dallas Heart Study (n=2202) who were free from CVD and underwent measurement of left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Associations of test results with the global composite CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary or peripheral revascularization, incident heart failure, or atrial fibrillation) and ASCVD (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) were assessed over >10 years of follow-up. Multivariable analyses for the primary global CVD end point adjusted for traditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors plus statin use and creatinine (base <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each test result was independently associated with global composite CVD events in MESA after adjustment for the components of the base <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> and the other test results (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). When the 5 tests were added to the base <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong>, the c-statistic improved from 0.74 to 0.79 (<i>P</i>=0.001), significant integrated discrimination improvement (0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.08, <i>P</i><0.001) and category free net reclassification improvement (0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–0.56; <i>P</i>=0.003) were observed, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">model</span></strong> was well calibrated (χ<sup>2</sup>=12.2, <i>P</i>=0.20). Using a simple integer score counting the number of abnormal tests, compared with those with a score of 0, global CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was increased among participants with a score of 1 (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6), 2 (hazard ratio, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.3–4.4), 3 (hazard ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.4–6.5), and ≥4 (hazard ratio, 7.5; 95% CI, 5.2–10.6). Findings replicated in the Dallas Health Study were similar for the ASCVD outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among adults without known CVD, a novel multimodality testing strategy using left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein significantly improved global CVD and ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> assessment.</p></sec>

Glycerophosphocholine Metabolites and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Adolescents
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Glycerophosphocholine (GPC) metabolites modulate atherosclerosis and thus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Preclinical CVD may start during adolescence. Here, we used targeted serum lipidomics to identify a new panel of GPCs, and tested whether any of these GPCs are associated, in adolescence, with classical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors of CVD, namely excess visceral fat (VF), elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, and atherogenic dyslipidemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied a population-based sample of 990 adolescents (12–18 years, 48% male), as part of the Saguenay Youth Study. Using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, we identified 69 serum GPCs within the 450 to 680 <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> range. We measured VF with MRI.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified several novel GPCs that were associated with multiple CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. Most significantly, PC16:0/2:0 was negatively associated with VF (<i>P</i>=1.4×10<sup>–19</sup>), blood pressure (<i>P</i>=7.7×10<sup>–5</sup>), and fasting triacylglycerols (<i>P</i>=9.0×10<sup>–5</sup>), and PC14:1/0:0 was positively associated with VF (<i>P</i>=3.0×10<sup>–7</sup>), fasting insulin (<i>P</i>=5.4×10<sup>–32</sup>), and triacylglycerols (<i>P</i>=1.4×10<sup>–29</sup>). The Sobel test of mediation revealed that both GPCs mediated their respective relations between VF (as a potential primary exposure) and CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors (as outcomes, <i>P</i> values<1.3×10<sup>–3</sup>). Furthermore, a GPC shown recently to predict incident coronary heart disease in older adults, PC18:2/0:0, was associated with several CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in adolescents; these associations were less strong than those with the newly identified GPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified novel GPCs strongly associated with multiple CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in adolescents. These GPCs may be sensitive indicators of obesity-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for CVD outcomes in adults, and may improve biological understanding of CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec>

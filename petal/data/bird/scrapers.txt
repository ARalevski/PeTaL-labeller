Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of ethane from its corresponding ethylene is an important, challenging, and energy-intensive process in the chemical industry. Here we report a microporous metal-organic framework, iron(III) peroxide 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate [Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) (dobdc<sup>4−</sup>: 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)], with iron (Fe)–peroxo sites for the preferential binding of ethane over ethylene and thus highly selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Neutron powder diffraction studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate the key role of Fe-peroxo sites for the recognition of ethane. The high performance of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for the ethane/ethylene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, and simulated and experimental breakthrough curves. Through a fixed-bed column packed with this porous material, polymer-grade ethylene (99.99% pure) can be straightforwardly produced from ethane/ethylene mixtures during the first adsorption cycle, demonstrating the potential of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for this important industrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation with a low energy cost under ambient conditions.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene
<p>The discovery of new materials for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ating ethylene from ethane by adsorption, instead of using cryogenic distillation, is a key milestone for molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations because of the multiple and widely extended uses of these molecules in industry. This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility. Control of such properties extends the boundaries for applicability of zeolites to challenging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations.</p>

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration
<p>Nanoporous two-dimensional materials are attractive for ionic and molecular nanofiltration but limited by insufficient mechanical strength over large areas. We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of atomically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water molecules while blocking solute ions or molecules to enable size-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The SWNT network physically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ates the GNM into microsized islands and acts as the microscopic framework to support the GNM, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the atomically thin GNM. The resulting GNM/SWNT membranes show high water permeance and a high rejection ratio for salt ions or organic molecules, and they retain stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation performance in tubular modules.</p>

Zeolitic imidazolate framework membranes made by ligand-induced permselectivation
<p>Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) membranes are emerging as a promising energy-efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation technology. However, their reliable and scalable manufacturing remains a challenge. We demonstrate the fabrication of ZIF nanocomposite membranes by means of an all-vapor-phase processing method based on atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO in a porous support followed by ligand-vapor treatment. After ALD, the obtained nanocomposite exhibits low flux and is not selective, whereas after ligand-vapor (2-methylimidazole) treatment, it is partially transformed to ZIF and shows stable performance with high mixture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation factor for propylene over propane (an energy-intensive high-volume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation) and high propylene flux.

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The binding of DNA to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which activates innate immune responses. We have shown that DNA binding to cGAS robustly induced the formation of liquidlike droplets in which cGAS was activated. The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation by increasing the valencies of DNA binding. Long DNA was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and cGAS enzyme activity than short DNA. Moreover, free zinc ions enhanced cGAS enzyme activity both in vitro and in cells by promoting cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. These results demonstrated that the DNA-induced phase transition of cGAS promotes cGAMP production and innate immune signaling.</p>

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with yeast prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical yeast prion protein Sup35. In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation followed by gelation. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH sensor domain. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation promoted yeast cell survival by rescuing the essential Sup35 translation factor from stress-induced damage. Thus, prion-like domains represent conserved environmental stress sensors that facilitate rapid adaptation in unstable environments by modifying protein phase behavior.</p>

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

ATM directs DNA damage responses and proteostasis via genetically separable pathways
<p>The protein kinase ATM is a master regulator of the DNA damage response but also responds directly to oxidative stress. Loss of ATM causes ataxia telangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder with pleiotropic symptoms that include cerebellar dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, and premature aging. We genetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated the activation of ATM by DNA damage from that by oxidative stress using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation-of-function mutations. We found that deficient activation of ATM by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and DNA double-strand breaks resulted in loss of cell viability, checkpoint activation, and DNA end resection in response to DNA damage. In contrast, loss of oxidative activation of ATM had minimal effects on DNA damage–related outcomes but blocked ATM-mediated initiation of checkpoint responses after oxidative stress and resulted in deficiencies in mitochondrial function and autophagy. In addition, expression of a variant ATM incapable of activation by oxidative stress resulted in widespread protein aggregation. These results indicate a direct relationship between the mechanism of ATM activation and its effects on cellular metabolism and DNA damage responses in human cells and implicate ATM in the control of protein homeostasis.</p>

Stoichiometry controls activity of phase-separated clusters of actin signaling proteins
<p>Biomolecular condensates concentrate macromolecules into foci without a surrounding membrane. Many condensates appear to form through multivalent interactions that drive liquid-liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation (LLPS). LLPS increases the specific activity of actin regulatory proteins toward actin assembly by the Arp2/3 complex. We show that this increase occurs because LLPS of the Nephrin–Nck–N-WASP signaling pathway on lipid bilayers increases membrane dwell time of N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex, consequently increasing actin assembly. Dwell time varies with relative stoichiometry of the signaling proteins in the phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated clusters, rendering N-WASP and Arp2/3 activity stoichiometry dependent. This mechanism of controlling protein activity is enabled by the stoichiometrically undefined nature of biomolecular condensates. Such regulation should be a general feature of signaling systems that assemble through multivalent interactions and drive nonequilibrium outputs.</p>

The PCP shows substantial temperature-responsive adsorption in which the adsorbate molecules are differentiated by each gate-admission temperature, facilitating kinetics-based gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations of oxygen/argon and ethylene/ethane with high selectivities of ~350 and ~75, respectively.

Phase separation focuses DNA sensing
<p>The presence of any double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytosol is a potent trigger for the activation of innate immune responses. In the context of an infection, immunorecognition of “foreign” dsDNA serves as a central host strategy to detect the presence of pathogens. Under certain conditions, however, sensing of aberrant cytosolic self-dsDNA can also promote destructive inflammation in autoinflammatory diseases. A fundamental question is how cells spatially organize and biochemically regulate the recognition of intracellular dsDNA in the vast cytosolic space of a cell. On page 704 in this issue, Du and Chen (<i>1</i>) introduce an elegant explanation by demonstrating that phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of the dsDNA sensor cGAS [cyclic GMP (guanosine monophosphate)–AMP (adenosine monophosphate) synthase] enables this central task.

Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control
<p>Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble a high density of the transcriptional apparatus to drive robust expression of genes with prominent roles in cell identity. Here we demonstrate that the SE-enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid-like condensates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb condensates. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts. These results support the idea that coactivators form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated condensates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-identity genes.</p>

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins
<p>Prion-like RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP43 and FUS are largely soluble in the nucleus but form solid pathological aggregates when mislocalized to the cytoplasm. What keeps these proteins soluble in the nucleus and promotes aggregation in the cytoplasm is still unknown. We report here that RNA critically regulates the phase behavior of prion-like RBPs. Low RNA/protein ratios promote phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and the formation of cytotoxic solid-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.</p>

Spatially distributed multipartite entanglement enables EPR steering of atomic clouds

We used spin mixing in a tightly confined Bose-Einstein condensate to generate an entangled state of indistinguishable particles in a single spatial mode. We show experimentally that this entanglement can be spatially distributed by self-similar expansion of the atomic cloud. We used spatially resolved spin read-out to reveal a particularly strong form of quantum correlations known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between distinct parts of the expanded cloud. Based on the strength of EPR steering, we constructed a witness, which confirmed genuine 5-partite entanglement.</p>

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The structure reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate the cavities. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base.

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles.

We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

Mechanism of Activation of Protein Kinase JAK2 by the Growth Hormone Receptor
<p>Signaling from JAK (Janus kinase) protein kinases to STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) transcription factors is key to many aspects of biology and medicine, yet the mechanism by which cytokine receptors initiate signaling is enigmatic. We present a complete mechanistic model for activation of receptor-bound JAK2, based on an archetypal cytokine receptor, the growth hormone receptor. For this, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor positioning of the JAK2 binding motif in the receptor dimer, substitution of the receptor extracellular domains with Jun zippers to control the position of its transmembrane (TM) helices, atomistic modeling of TM helix movements, and docking of the crystal structures of the JAK2 kinase and its inhibitory pseudokinase domain with an opposing kinase-pseudokinase domain pair. Activation of the receptor dimer induced a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of its JAK2 binding motifs, driven by a ligand-induced transition from a parallel TM helix pair to a left-handed crossover arrangement. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation leads to removal of the pseudokinase domain from the kinase domain of the partner JAK2 and pairing of the two kinase domains, facilitating trans-activation. This model may well generalize to other class I cytokine receptors.</p>

PROTEIN PHOSHATASE 2A B’<i>α</i> and <i>β</i> Maintain Centromeric Sister Chromatid Cohesion during Meiosis in Arabidopsis
<p>The correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, and sister chromatids during meiosis II, relies on the tight control of the cohesion complex. The phosphorylation and subsequent cleavage of the meiotic recombination protein REC8 (REC8-like family protein [SYN1] in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]), the α-kleisin subunit of the cohesion ring, along the chromosome arms at meiosis I allows crossovers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes without chromatid dissociation. REC8 continues to localize and function at the centromeres up to metaphase II and, in yeast and vertebrates, is protected from cleavage by means of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation. Here, we show that, in plants, centromeric sister chromatid cohesion until meiosis II also requires the activity of a PP2A-type phosphatase complex. The combined absence of the regulatory subunits PP2AB′α and PP2AB′β leads to the premature loss of chromosome cohesion in meiosis I. Male meiocytes of the <i>pp2ab′αβ</i> double mutant display premature depletion of SYN1. The PP2AA1 structural and B′α regulatory subunit localize specifically to centromeres until metaphase II, supporting a role for the PP2A complex in the SYN1-mediated maintenance of centromeric cohesion in plant meiosis.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The adhesion of plant cells is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between cell wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant cells are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border cells are examples of this. Border cells (in some species known as border-like cells) provide an expendable barrier between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex cellular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip cell walls. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of cell wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of cell wall components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified multiple novel modes of cell wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border cells. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border cell maturation and enable us to develop a model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation process. We propose that loss of adhesion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of cell curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

Oleuropein and its deglycosylated derivatives have high pharmaceutical interest. In this study we determined that the in planta heterologous expressed OeGLU, an oleuropein-specific β-glucosidase from olive (<i>Olea europaea</i>), had enzymatic kinetics similar to the olive native enzyme. The C terminus encompassing the nuclear localization signal sequesters the enzyme in the nucleus, and predetermines the protein-protein recognition and homodimerization. Biochemical analysis revealed that OeGLU is a homomultimer with high <i>M</i><sub>r</sub>. In silico prediction modeling of the complex structure and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses revealed that the C terminus of OeGLU is essential for the proper assembly of an octameric form, a key conformational feature that determines the activity of the enzyme. Our results demonstrate that intrinsic characteristics of the OeGLU ensure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation from oleuropein and keep the dual-partner defensive system conditionally inactive. Upon cell destruction, the dual-partner defense system is activated and olive massively releases the arsenal of defense.</p>

Quantifying Wheat Sensitivities to Environmental Constraints to Dissect Genotype × Environment Interactions in the Field
<p>Yield is subject to strong genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions in the field, especially under abiotic constraints such as soil water deficit (drought [D]) and high temperature (heat [H]). Since environmental conditions show strong fluctuations during the whole crop cycle, geneticists usually do not consider environmental measures as quantitative variables but rather as factors in multienvironment analyses. Based on 11 experiments in a field platform with contrasting temperature and soil water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to drought and heat constraints in wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components. G × E interactions were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated into their underlying components, constitutive genotypic effect (G), G × D, G × H, and G × H × D, and were analyzed for two genotypes, highlighting contrasting responses to heat and drought constraints. We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviors of two strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated previously with yield components. This analysis confirmed the constitutive effect of the chromosome 1B QTL and explained the G × E interaction of the chromosome 3B QTL by a benefit of one allele when temperature rises. In addition to the method itself, which can be applied to other data sets and populations, this study will support the cloning of a major yield QTL on chromosome 3B that is highly dependent on environmental conditions and for which the climatic interaction is now quantified.</p>

Vesicle Dynamics during Plant Cell Cytokinesis Reveals Distinct Developmental Phases
<p>Cell division in plant cells requires the deposition of a new cell wall between the two daughter cells. The assembly of this plate requires the coordinated movement of cargo vesicles whose size is below the diffraction-limited resolution of the optical microscope. We combined high spatial and temporal resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy with advanced image-processing tools and fluorescence fluctuation methods and distinguished three distinct phases during cell plate expansion in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) ‘Bright Yellow-2’ cells: massive delivery of preexisting vesicles to a disk-shaped region at the equatorial plane precedes a primary rapid expansion phase followed by a secondary, slow expansion phase during which the extremity of the circular plate seeks contact with the mother wall and brings about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of the two portions of cytoplasm. Different effects of pharmacological inhibition emphasize the distinct nature of the assembly and expansion mechanisms characterizing these phases.</p>

Genome Wide Analysis of Fatty Acid Desaturation and Its Response to Temperature
<p>Plants modify the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of their membrane and storage lipids in order to adapt to changes in temperature. In developing seeds, this response is largely controlled by the activities of the microsomal ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acid desaturases, FAD2 and FAD3. Although temperature regulation of desaturation has been studied at the molecular and biochemical levels, the genetic control of this trait is poorly understood. Here, we have characterized the response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed lipids to variation in ambient temperature and found that heat inhibits both ω-6 and ω-3 desaturation in phosphatidylcholine, leading to a proportional change in triacylglycerol composition. Analysis of the 19 parental accessions of the multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population showed that significant natural variation exists in the temperature responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation. A combination of quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using the MAGIC population suggests that ω-6 desaturation is largely controlled by cis-acting sequence variants in the <i>FAD2</i> 5′ untranslated region intron that determine the expression level of the gene. However, the temperature responsiveness of ω-6 desaturation is controlled by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate QTL on chromosome 2. The identity of this locus is unknown, but genome-wide association studies identified potentially causal sequence variants within ∼40 genes in an ∼450-kb region of the QTL.</p>

Understanding and Manipulating Meiotic Recombination in Plants
<p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of chromosomes, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is homologous recombination, which promotes homologous pairing and generates crossovers (COs) to connect homologous chromosomes until their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding program depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on chromosomes. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per chromosome pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of chromosome size. Moreover, their positions are not random on chromosomes but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the generation of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding programs. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.</p>

Soluble and Membrane-Bound β-Glucosidases Are Involved in Trimming the Xyloglucan Backbone
<p>In many flowering plants, xyloglucan is a major component of primary cell walls, where it plays an important role in growth regulation. Xyloglucan can be degraded by a suite of exoglycosidases that remove specific sugars. In this work, we show that the xyloglucan backbone, formed by (1→4)-linked β-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl residues, can be attacked by two different Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) β-glucosidases from glycoside hydrolase family 3. While BGLC1 (At5g20950; for β-glucosidase active against xyloglucan 1) is responsible for all or most of the soluble activity, BGLC3 (At5g04885) is usually a membrane-anchored protein. Mutations in these two genes, whether on their own or combined with mutations in other exoglycosidase genes, resulted in the accumulation of partially digested xyloglucan subunits, such as GXXG, GXLG, or GXFG. While a mutation in <i>BGLC1</i> had significant effects on its own, lack of <i>BGLC3</i> had only minor effects. On the other hand, double <i>bglc1 bglc3</i> mutants revealed a synergistic interaction that supports a role for membrane-bound BGLC3 in xyloglucan metabolism. In addition, <i>bglc1 bglc3</i> was complemented by overexpression of either <i>BGLC1</i> or <i>BGLC3</i>. In overexpression lines, BGLC3 activity was concentrated in a microsome-enriched fraction but also was present in soluble form. Finally, both genes were generally expressed in the same cell types, although, in some cases, <i>BGLC3</i> was expressed at earlier stages than <i>BGLC1</i>. We propose that functional specialization could explain the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate localization of both enzymes, as a membrane-bound β-glucosidase could specifically digest soluble xyloglucan without affecting the wall-bound polymer.</p>

Connecting the Molecular Structure of Cutin to Ultrastructure and Physical Properties of the Cuticle in Petals of Arabidopsis
<p>The plant cuticle is laid down at the cell wall surface of epidermal cells in a wide variety of structures, but the functional significance of this architectural diversity is not yet understood. Here, the structure-function relationship of the petal cuticle of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) was investigated. Applying Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy, the cutin mutants <i>long-chain acyl-coenzyme A synthetase2</i> (<i>lacs2</i>), <i>permeable cuticle1 (pec1)</i>, <i>cyp77a6</i>, <i>glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase6</i> (<i>gpat6</i>), and <i>defective in cuticular ridges</i> (<i>dcr</i>) were grouped in three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate classes based on quantitative differences in the ν(C=O) and ν(C-H) band vibrations. These were associated mainly with the quantity of 10,16-dihydroxy hexadecanoic acid, a monomer of the cuticle polyester, cutin. These spectral features were linked to three different types of cuticle organization: a normal cuticle with nanoridges (<i>lacs2</i> and <i>pec1</i> mutants); a broad translucent cuticle (<i>cyp77a6</i> and <i>dcr</i> mutants); and an electron-opaque multilayered cuticle (<i>gpat6</i> mutant). The latter two types did not have typical nanoridges. Transmission electron microscopy revealed considerable variations in cuticle thickness in the <i>dcr</i> mutant. Different double mutant combinations showed that a low amount of C16 monomers in cutin leads to the appearance of an electron-translucent layer adjacent to the cuticle proper, which is independent of DCR action. We concluded that DCR is not only essential for incorporating 10,16-dihydroxy C16:0 into cutin but also plays a crucial role in the organization of the cuticle, independent of cutin composition. Further characterization of the mutant petals suggested that nanoridge formation and conical cell shape may contribute to the reduction of physical adhesion forces between petals and other floral organs during floral development.</p>

Phosphorylation of MAP65-1 by Arabidopsis Aurora Kinases Is Required for Efficient Cell Cycle Progression
<p>Aurora kinases are key effectors of mitosis. Plant Auroras are functionally divided into two clades. The alpha Auroras (Aurora1 and Aurora2) associate with the spindle and the cell plate and are implicated in controlling formative divisions throughout plant development. The beta Aurora (Aurora3) localizes to centromeres and likely functions in chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. In contrast to the wealth of data available on the role of Aurora in other kingdoms, knowledge on their function in plants is merely emerging. This is exemplified by the fact that only histone H3 and the plant homolog of TPX2 have been identified as Aurora substrates in plants. Here we provide biochemical, genetic, and cell biological evidence that the microtubule-bundling protein MAP65-1—a member of the MAP65/Ase1/PRC1 protein family, implicated in central spindle formation and cytokinesis in animals, yeasts, and plants—is a genuine substrate of alpha Aurora kinases. MAP65-1 interacts with Aurora1 in vivo and is phosphorylated on two residues at its unfolded tail domain. Its overexpression and down-regulation antagonistically affect the alpha Aurora double mutant phenotypes. Phospho-mutant analysis shows that Aurora contributes to the microtubule bundling capacity of MAP65-1 in concert with other mitotic kinases.</p>

Homologues of the RPW8 Resistance Protein Are Localized to the Extrahaustorial Membrane that Is Likely Synthesized De Novo
<p>Upon penetration of the host cell wall, the powdery mildew fungus develops a feeding structure named the haustorium in the invaded host cell. Concomitant with haustorial biogenesis, the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) is formed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate the haustorium from the host cell cytoplasm. The Arabidopsis resistance protein RPW8.2 is specifically targeted to the EHM where it activates haustorium-targeted resistance against powdery mildew. RPW8.2 belongs to a small family with six members in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Whether Homologs of RPW8 (HR) 1 to HR4 are also localized to the EHM and contribute to resistance has not been determined. Here, we report that overexpression of <i>HR1</i>, <i>HR2</i>, or <i>HR3</i> led to enhanced resistance to powdery mildew, while genetic depletion of <i>HR2</i> or <i>HR3</i> resulted in enhanced susceptibility, indicating that these <i>RPW8</i> homologs contribute to basal resistance. Interestingly, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR1 to HR3 are also EHM-localized. This suggests that EHM-targeting is an ancestral feature of the RPW8 family. Indeed, two RPW8 homologs from <i>Brassica oleracea</i> tested also exhibit EHM-localization. Domain swapping analysis between HR3 and RPW8.2 suggests that sequence diversification in the N-terminal 146 amino acids of RPW8.2 probably functionally distinguishes it from other family members. Moreover, we found that N-terminally YFP-tagged HR3 is also localized to the plasma membrane and the fungal penetration site (the papilla) in addition to the EHM. Using this unique feature of YFP-HR3, we obtained preliminary evidence to suggest that the EHM is unlikely derived from invagination of the plasma membrane, rather it may be mainly synthesized de novo.</p>

Dirigent Protein Mode of Action Revealed by the Crystal Structure of AtDIR6
<p>Dirigent proteins impart stereoselectivity to phenoxy radical coupling reactions in plants and, thus, play an essential role in the biosynthesis of biologically active natural products. This includes the regioselective and enantioselective coupling and subsequent cyclization of two coniferyl alcohol radicals to pinoresinol as the committed step of lignan biosynthesis. The reaction is controlled by dirigent proteins, which, depending on the species and protein, direct the reaction to either (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol. We present the crystal structure of the (−)-pinoresinol forming DIRIGENT PROTEIN6 (AtDIR6) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with data to 1.4 Å resolution. The structure shows AtDIR6 as an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel that forms a trimer with spatially well-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated cavities for substrate binding. The binding cavities are two lobed, exhibiting two opposing pockets, each lined with a set of hydrophilic and potentially catalytic residues, including essential aspartic acids. These residues are conserved between (+) and (−)-pinoresinol-forming DIRs and required for activity. The structure supports a model in which two substrate radicals bind to each of the DIR monomers. With the aromatic rings fixed in the two pockets, the propionyl side chains face each other for radical-radical coupling, and stereoselectivity is determined by the exact positioning of the side chains. Extensive mutational analysis supports a previously unrecognized function for DIRs in catalyzing the cyclization of the bis-quinone methide reaction intermediate to yield (+)- or (−)-pinoresinol.</p>

Transcriptome and Degradome Sequencing Reveals Dormancy Mechanisms of <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> Seeds<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Seeds with physiological dormancy usually experience primary and secondary dormancy in the nature; however, little is known about the differential regulation of primary and secondary dormancy. We combined multiple approaches to investigate cytological changes, hormonal levels, and gene expression dynamics in <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> seeds during primary dormancy release and secondary dormancy induction. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that protein bodies in the embryo cells coalesced during primary dormancy release and then <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated during secondary dormancy induction. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that expression of genes negatively regulating gibberellic acid (GA) sensitivity reduced specifically during primary dormancy release, whereas the expression of genes positively regulating abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis increased during secondary dormancy induction. Parallel analysis of RNA ends revealed uncapped transcripts for ∼55% of all unigenes. A negative correlation between fold changes in expression levels of uncapped versus capped mRNAs was observed during primary dormancy release. However, this correlation was loose during secondary dormancy induction. Our analyses suggest that the reversible changes in cytology and gene expression during dormancy release and induction are related to ABA/GA balance. Moreover, mRNA degradation functions as a critical posttranscriptional regulator during primary dormancy release. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding physiological dormancy in seeds.</p>

Evolutionary and Functional Analysis of Membrane-Bound NAC Transcription Factor Genes in Soybean
<p>Functional divergence is thought to be an important evolutionary driving force for the retention of duplicate genes. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) membrane-bound NAC transcription factor (NTL) genes. NTLs are thought to be components of stress signaling and unique in their requirement for proteolytic cleavage to free them from the membrane. Most of the 15 <i>GmNTL</i> genes appear to have evolved under strong purifying selection. By analyzing the phylogenetic tree and gene synteny, we identified seven duplicate gene pairs generated by the latest whole-genome duplication. The members of each pair were shown to have variously diverged at the transcriptional (organ specificity and responsiveness to stress), posttranscriptional (alternative splicing), and protein (proteolysis-mediated membrane release and transactivation activity) levels. The dormant (full-length protein) and active (protein without a transmembrane motif) forms of one pair of duplicated gene products (GmNTL1/GmNLT11) were each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ately constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The heteroexpression of active but not dormant forms of these proteins caused improved tolerance to abiotic stresses, suggesting that membrane release was required for their functionality. Arabidopsis carrying the dormant form of GmNTL1 was more tolerant to hydrogen peroxide, which induces its membrane release. Tolerance was not increased in the line carrying dormant GmNTL11, which was not released by hydrogen peroxide treatment. Thus, NTL-release pattern changes may cause phenotypic divergence. It was concluded that a variety of functional divergences contributed to the retention of these <i>GmNTL</i> duplicates.</p>

Comparative Genomics of the Pine Pathogens and Beetle Symbionts in the Genus <i>Grosmannia</i>
<p>Studies on beetle/tree fungal symbionts typically characterize the ecological and geographic distributions of the fungal populations. There is limited understanding of the genome-wide evolutionary processes that act within and between species as such fungi adapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess genomic evidence for such evolutionary processes by extending our recent work on <i>Grosmannia clavigera</i>, which is vectored by the mountain pine beetle and jeffrey pine beetle. We report the genome sequences of an additional 11 <i>G. clavigera</i> (Gc) sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species, <i>Grosmannia</i> sp. (Gs) and Gc. The 12 fungal genomes are structurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between species. We identified 103,430 single-nucleotide variations that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated the <i>Grosmannia</i> strains into divergent Gs and Gc clades, and further divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which may represent an additional species. Comparing variable genes between these lineages, we identified truncated genes and potential pseudogenes, as well as seven genes that show evidence of positive selection. As these variable genes are involved in secondary metabolism and in detoxifying or utilizing host-tree defense chemicals (e.g., polyketide synthases, oxidoreductases, and mono-oxygenases), their variants may reflect adaptation to the specific chemistries of the host trees <i>Pinus contorta</i>, <i>P. ponderosa</i>, and <i>P. jeffreyi</i>. This work provides a comprehensive resource for developing informative markers for landscape population genomics of these ecologically and economically important fungi, and an approach that could be extended to other beetle–tree-associated fungi.</p>

Ancestry of the Australian Termitivorous Numbat
<p>The Australian numbat, <i>Myrmecobius fasciatus</i>, is the only marsupial that feeds almost exclusively on termites and that has a life following the diurnally restricted and dynamic geographical distribution of termites. The millions of years of this adaptation led to unique morphological and anatomical features, especially basicranial and dental characteristics, that make it difficult to identify a clear phylogenetic affiliation to other marsupials. From DNA sequence analyses, the family Myrmecobiidae is placed within the dasyuromorph marsupials, but the exact position varies from study to study, and support values are mostly rather modest. Here, we report the recovery and analysis of approximately 110,000 quasifossilized traces of mobile element insertions into the genome of a dasyurid marsupial (Tasmanian devil), 25 of which are phylogenetically informative for early dasyuromorphial evolution. Fourteen of these ancient retroposon insertions are shared by the 16 Dasyuromorphia species analyzed, including the numbat, but are absent in the outgroups. An additional 11 other insertions are present in all Dasyuridae but are absent in the numbat. These findings place numbats as the sister group to all living Dasyuridae and show that the investigated Dasyuromorphia, including the Myrmecobiidae, constitutes a monophyletic group that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated from Peramelemorphia, Notoryctemorphia, and other marsupials.</p>

Brains over brawn: experience overcomes a size disadvantage in fish social hierarchies
<p>Life experiences can alter cognitive abilities and subsequent behavior. Here we asked whether differences in experience could affect social status. In hierarchical animal societies, high-ranking males that typically win aggressive encounters gain territories and hence access to mates. To understand the relative contributions of social experience and physical environment on status, we used a highly territorial African cichlid fish species, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, that lives in a dynamic lek-like social hierarchy. <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i> males are either dominant or submissive and can switch status rapidly depending on the local environment. Although dominant males are innately aggressive, we wondered whether they modulated their aggression based on experience. We hypothesized that as males mature they might <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hone</span></strong> their fighting tactics based on observation of other males fighting. We compared males of different ages and sizes in distinctly different physical environments and subsequently tested their fighting skills. We found that a size difference previously thought negligible (<10% body length) gave a significant advantage to the larger opponent. In contrast, we found no evidence that increasing environmental complexity affected status outcomes. Surprisingly, we found that males only a few days older than their opponents had a significant advantage during territorial disputes so that being older compensated for the disadvantage of being smaller. Moreover, the slightly older winners exploited a consistent fighting strategy, starting with lower levels of aggression on the first day that significantly increased on the second day, a pattern absent in younger winners. These data suggest that experience is an advantage during fights for status, and that social learning provides more relevant experience than the physical complexity of the territory.</p>

The effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
<p>The effects of flight behavior on physiology and senescence may be profound in insects because of the extremely high metabolic costs of flight. Flight capacity in insects decreases with age; in contrast, limiting flight behavior extends lifespan and slows the age-related loss of antioxidant capacity and accumulation of oxidative damage in flight muscles. In this study, we tested the effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity by measuring wingbeat frequency, the ability to fly in a hypo-dense gas mixture, and metabolic rate in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Specifically, 5-day-old adult flies were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated into three life-long treatments: (1) those not allowed to fly (no flight), (2) those allowed – but not forced – to fly (voluntary flight) and (3) those mechanically stimulated to fly (induced flight). Flight capacity senesced earliest in flies from the no-flight treatment, followed by the induced-flight group and then the voluntary flight group. Wingbeat frequency senesced with age in all treatment groups, but was most apparent in the voluntary- and induced-flight groups. Metabolic rate during agitated flight senesced earliest and most rapidly in the induced flight group, and was low and uniform throughout age in the no-flight group. Early senescence in the induced-flight group was likely due to the acceleration of deleterious aging phenomena such as the rapid accumulation of damage at the cellular level, while the early loss of flight capacity and low metabolic rates in the no-flight group demonstrate that disuse effects can also significantly alter senescence patterns of whole-insect performance.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic cost of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic cost of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

The   aim of this study was to determine whether retaining the deltoid   at the time of resection would increase the rate of local recurrence.   We also sought to identify the variables that persuade expert surgeons   to choose a deltoid sparing rather than deltoid resecting procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 45 patients who had undergone resection of a primary   malignant tumour of the proximal humerus. There were 29 in the deltoid   sparing group and 16 in the deltoid resecting group. Imaging studies   were reviewed to assess tumour extension and soft-tissue involvement.   The presence of a fat rim <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ating the tumour from the deltoid   on MRI was particularly noted. The cumulative probability of local   recurrence was calculated in a competing risk scenario.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference (adjusted p = 0.89) in the   cumulative probability of local recurrence between the deltoid sparing   (7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 to 20) and the deltoid resecting   group (26%, 95% CI 8 to 50). Patients were more likely to be selected   for a deltoid sparing procedure if they presented with a small tumour   (p = 0.0064) with less bone involvement (p = 0.032) and a continuous   fat rim on MRI (p = 0.002) and if the axillary nerve could be identified   (p = 0.037).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A deltoid sparing procedure can provide good local control after   resection of the proximal humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour.   A smaller tumour, the presence of a continuous fat rim and the identification   of the axillary nerve on pre-operative MRI will persuade surgeons   to opt for a deltoid resecting procedure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1244–9.</p></sec>

The effect of operating lights on laminar flow
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The interaction between surgical lighting and laminar airflow   is poorly understood. We undertook an experiment to identify any   effect contemporary surgical lights have on laminar flow and recommend   practical strategies to limit any negative effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Neutrally buoyant bubbles were introduced into the surgical field   of a simulated setup for a routine total knee arthroplasty in a   laminar flow theatre. Patterns of airflow were observed and the   number of bubbles remaining above the surgical field over time identified.   Five different lighting configurations were assessed. Data were analysed   using simple linear regression after logarithmic transformation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the absence of surgical lights, laminar airflow was observed,   bubbles were cleared rapidly and did not accumulate. If lights were   placed above the surgical field laminar airflow was abolished and   bubbles rose from the surgical field to the lights then circulated   back to the surgical field. The value of the decay parameter (slope)   of the two setups differed significantly; no light (b = -1.589) <i>versus</i> one   light (b = -0.1273, p < 0.001).</p><p>Two lights touching (b = -0.1191) above the surgical field had   a similar effect to that of a single light (p = 0. 2719). Two lights   positioned by arms outstretched had a similar effect    (b = -0.1204) to two lights touching (p = 0.998) and one light (p   = 0.444). When lights were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated widely (160 cm), laminar airflow   was observed but the rate of clearance of the bubbles remained slower   (b = -1.1165) than with no lights present (p = 0.004). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Surgical lights have a significantly negative effect on laminar   airflow. Lights should be positioned as far away as practicable   from the surgical field to limit this effect.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1061–6.</p></sec>

Oxidised zirconium <i>versus</i> cobalt alloy bearing surfaces in total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We sought to establish whether an oxidised zirconium (OxZr) femoral   component causes less loss of polyethylene volume than a cobalt   alloy (CoCr) femoral component in total knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 20 retrieved tibial inserts that had articulated with   OxZr components were matched with 20 inserts from CoCr articulations   for patient age, body mass index, length of implantation, and revision   diagnosis. Changes in dimensions of the articular surfaces were compared   with those of pristine inserts using laser scanning. The differences   in volume between the retrieved and pristine surfaces of the two   groups were calculated and compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The loss of polyethylene volume was 122 mm<sup>3</sup> (standard   deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 87) in the OxZr group and 170 mm<sup>3</sup> (<sc>sd</sc> 96)   in the CoCr group (p = 0.033).

Radiographic scoring system for the evaluation of stability of cementless acetabular components in the presence of osteolysis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The stability of cementless acetabular components is an important   factor for surgical planning in the treatment of patients with pelvic   osteolysis after total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, the methods   for determining the stability of the acetabular component from pre-operative   radiographs remain controversial. Our aim was to develop a scoring   system to help in the assessment of the stability of the acetabular   component under these circumstances.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The new scoring system is based on the mechanism of failure of   these components and the location of the osteolytic lesion, according   to the DeLee and Charnley classification. Each zone is evaluated   and scored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ately. The sum of the individual scores from the   three zones is reported as a total score with a maximum of 10 points.   The study involved 96 revision procedures which were undertaken   for wear or osteolysis in 91 patients between July 2002 and December   2012. Pre-operative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and Judet   views were reviewed. The stability of the acetabular component was   confirmed intra-operatively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Intra-operatively, it was found that 64 components were well-fixed   and 32 were loose. Mean total scores in the well-fixed and loose   components were 2.9 (0 to 7) and 7.2 (1 to 10), respectively (p   < 0.001). In hips with a low score (0 to 2), the component was   only loose in one of 33 hips (3%). The incidence of loosening increased   with increasing scores: in those with scores of 3 and 4, two of   19 components (10.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 5 and 6, eight   of 19 components (44.5%) were loose; in hips with scores of 7 or   8, 13 of 17 components (70.6%) were loose; and for hips with scores   of 9 and 10, nine of nine components (100%) were loose. Receiver-operating-characteristic curve   analysis demonstrated very good accuracy (area under the curve =   0.90, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff point was a score of ≥ 5   with a sensitivity of 0.79, and a specificity of 0.87.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There was a strong correlation between the scoring system and   the probability of loosening of a cementless acetabular component.   This scoring system provides a clinically useful tool for pre-operative   planning, and the evaluation of the outcome of revision surgery   for patients with loosening of a cementless acetabular component   in the presence of osteolysis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:601–6.</p></sec>

The unsuspected prosthetic joint infection
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Positive cultures are not uncommon in cases of revision total   knee and hip arthroplasty (TKA and THA) for presumed aseptic causes.   The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of positive   intra-operative cultures in presumed aseptic revision of TKA and   THA, and to determine whether the presence of intra-operative positive cultures   results in inferior survival in such cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective cohort study was assembled with 679 patients   undergoing revision knee (340 cases) or hip arthroplasty (339 cases)   for presumed aseptic causes. For all patients three or more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate   intra-operative cultures were obtained. Patients were diagnosed   with a previously unsuspected prosthetic joint infection (PJI) if two   or more cultures were positive with the same organism. Records were   reviewed for demographic details, pre-operative laboratory results   and culture results. The primary outcome measure was infection-free   implant survival at two years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The incidence of unsuspected PJI was 27 out of 340 (7.9%) in   TKA and 41 out of 339 (12.1%) in THA. Following revision TKA, the   rate of infection-free implant survival in patients with an unsuspected   PJI was 88% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 60 to 97) at two years   compared with 98% (95% CI 94 to 99) in patients without PJI (p = 0.001).   After THA, the rate of survival was similar in those with unsuspected   PJI (92% (95% CI 73 to 98) at two years) and those without (94%   (95% CI 89 to 97), p = 0.31).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Following revision of TKA and THA for aseptic diagnoses, around   10% of cases were found to have positive cultures.

Functional outcome and alignment in computer-assisted and conventionally operated total knee replacements
<p>We performed a randomised controlled trial comparing   computer-assisted surgery (CAS) with conventional surgery (CONV)   in total knee replacement (TKR). Between 2009 and 2011 a total of   192 patients with a mean age of 68 years (55 to 85) with osteoarthritis   or arthritic disease of the knee were recruited from four Norwegian   hospitals. At three months follow-up, functional results were marginally   better for the CAS group. Mean differences (MD) in favour of CAS   were found for the Knee Society function score (MD: 5.9, 95% confidence   interval (CI) 0.3 to 11.4, p = 0.039), the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis   Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales for ‘pain’ (MD: 7.7, 95% CI 1.7 to   13.6, p = 0.012), ‘sports’ (MD: 13.5, 95% CI 5.6 to 21.4, p = 0.001)   and ‘quality of life’ (MD: 7.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 14.3, p = 0.046).   At one-year follow-up, differences favouring CAS were found for   KOOS ‘sports’ (MD: 11.0, 95% CI 3.0 to 19.0, p = 0.007) and KOOS   ‘symptoms’ (MD: 6.7, 95% CI 0.5 to 13.0, p = 0.035). The use of   CAS resulted in fewer outliers in frontal alignment (> 3° malalignment),   both for the entire TKR (37.9% <i>vs</i> 17.9%, p = 0.042)   and for the tibial component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ately (28.4% <i>vs</i> 6.3%,   p = 0.002). Tibial slope was better achieved with CAS (58.9% <i>vs</i> 26.3%,   p < 0.001). Operation time was 20 minutes longer with CAS. In   conclusion, functional results were, statistically, marginally in favour   of CAS. Also, CAS was more predictable than CONV for mechanical   alignment and positioning of the prosthesis. However, the long-term   outcomes must be further investigated.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:609–18.</p>

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for fractures of the navicular that gives associated injuries   involving the lateral column due consideration. We have shown that   this system is reliable and reproducible and have described the   rationale for the subsequent treatment of each type.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:176–82.</p></sec>

From shape to cells: mouse models reveal mechanisms altering palate development in Apert syndrome
<p>Apert syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by severe skull malformations and caused by one of two missense mutations, S252W and P253R, on fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). The molecular bases underlying differential Apert syndrome phenotypes are still poorly understood and it is unclear why cleft palate is more frequent in patients carrying the S252W mutation. Taking advantage of Apert syndrome mouse models, we performed a novel combination of morphometric, histological and immunohistochemical analyses to precisely quantify distinct palatal phenotypes in <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> and <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/P253R</sup></i> mice. We localized regions of differentially altered FGF signaling and assessed local cell patterns to establish a baseline for understanding the differential effects of these two <i>Fgfr2</i> mutations. Palatal suture scoring and comparative 3D shape analysis from high resolution μCT images of 120 newborn mouse skulls showed that <i>Fgfr2<sup>+/S252W</sup></i> mice display relatively more severe palate dysmorphologies, with contracted and more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated palatal shelves, a greater tendency to fuse the maxillary-palatine sutures and aberrant development of the inter-premaxillary suture. These palatal defects are associated with suture-specific patterns of abnormal cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The posterior region of the developing palate emerges as a potential target for therapeutic strategies in clinical management of cleft palate in Apert syndrome patients.</p>

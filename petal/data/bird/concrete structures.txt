Extra strengthening and work hardening in gradient nanotwinned metals
<p>Gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es exist ubiquitously in nature and are increasingly being introduced in engineering. However, understanding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradient–related mechanical behaviors in all gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, including those in engineering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, has been challenging. We explored the mechanical performance of a gradient nanotwinned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with highly tunable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradients in pure copper. A large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al gradient allows for superior work hardening and strength that can exceed those of the strongest component of the gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. We found through systematic experiments and atomistic simulations that this unusual behavior is afforded by a unique patterning of ultrahigh densities of dislocations in the grain interiors. These observations not only shed light on gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, but may also indicate a promising route for improving the mechanical properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als through gradient design.</p>

Single-stranded DNA and RNA origami
<p>Self-folding of an information-carrying polymer into a defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foundat</span></strong>ional to biology and offers attractive potential as a synthetic strategy. Although multicomponent self-assembly has produced complex synthetic nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, unimolecular folding has seen limited progress. We describe a framework to design and synthesize a single DNA or RNA strand to self-fold into a complex yet unknotted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e that approximates an arbitrary user-prescribed shape. We experimentally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> diverse multikilobase single-stranded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, including a ~10,000-nucleotide (nt) DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e and a ~6000-nt RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. We demonstrate facile replication of the strand in vitro and in living cells. The work here thus establishes unimolecular folding as a general strategy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing complex and replicable nucleic acid nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, and expands the design space and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al scalability for bottom-up nanotechnology.</p>

The apo-structure of the leucine sensor Sestrin2 is still elusive
<p>Sestrin2 is a GATOR2-interacting protein that directly binds leucine and is required for the inhibition of mTORC1 under leucine deprivation, indicating that it is a leucine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway. We recently reported the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of Sestrin2 in complex with leucine [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID, 5DJ4] and demonstrated that mutations in the leucine-binding pocket that alter the affinity of Sestrin2 for leucine result in a corresponding change in the leucine sensitivity of mTORC1 in cells. A lower resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of human Sestrin2 (PDB ID, 5CUF), which was crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine, showed Sestrin2 to be in a nearly identical conformation as the leucine-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. On the basis of this observation, it has been argued that leucine binding does not affect the conformation of Sestrin2 and that Sestrin2 may not be a sensor for leucine. We show that simple analysis of the reported “apo”-Sestrin2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals the clear presence of prominent, unmodeled electron density in the leucine-binding pocket that exactly accommodates the leucine observed in the higher resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. Refining the reported apo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with leucine eliminated the large <i>F</i><sub>obs</sub>-<i>F</i><sub>calc</sub> difference density at this position and improved the working and free R factors of the model. Consistent with this result, our own <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of Sestrin2 crystallized in the absence of exogenous leucine also contained electron density that is best explained by leucine. Thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of apo-Sestrin2 remains elusive.</p>

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence design and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 designs predicted to fold into single stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Nuclear magnetic resonance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of 9 of 12 designed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic designs, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es possible for short peptide macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug design and library selection methods.</p>

D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor high-resolution structures enable the discovery of selective agonists
<p>Dopamine receptors are implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of nearly every neuropsychiatric disorder. Although thousands of drugs interact with these receptors, our molecular understanding of dopaminergic drug selectivity and design remains clouded. To illuminate dopamine receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, function, and ligand recognition, we determined crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor in its inactive state bound to the antipsychotic drug nemonapride, with resolutions up to 1.95 angstroms. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es suggest a mechanism for the control of constitutive signaling, and their unusually high resolution enabled a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e-based campaign for new agonists of the D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptor. The ability to efficiently exploit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e for specific probe discovery—rapidly moving from elucidating receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e to discovering previously unrecognized, selective agonists—testifies to the power of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e-based approaches.</p>

Protein structure determination using metagenome sequence data

We show that Rosetta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e prediction guided by residue-residue contacts inferred from evolutionary information can accurately model proteins that belong to large families and that metagenome sequence data more than triple the number of protein families with sufficient sequences for accurate modeling.

Electron diffraction determines molecular absolute configuration in a pharmaceutical nanocrystal

Spin coating epitaxial films

Mechanoresponsive self-growing hydrogels inspired by muscle training

Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The metal-insulator transition in correlated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al phase transition.

Three-dimensional genome structures of single diploid human cells

Characterization of genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es necessitates single-cell measurements. This has been achieved for haploid cells but has remained a challenge for diploid cells. We developed a single-cell chromatin conformation capture method, termed Dip-C, that combines a transposon-based whole-genome amplification method to detect many chromatin contacts, called META (multiplex end-tagging amplification), and an algorithm to impute the two chromosome haplotypes linked by each contact.

Exploiting CELLULOSE SYNTHASE (CESA) Class Specificity to Probe Cellulose Microfibril Biosynthesis
<p>Cellulose microfibrils are the basic units of cellulose in plants. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of these microfibrils is at least partly determined by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the cellulose synthase complex. In higher plants, this complex is composed of 18 to 24 catalytic subunits known as CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A (CESA) proteins. Three different classes of CESA proteins are required for cellulose synthesis and for secondary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis these classes are represented by CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. To probe the relationship between CESA proteins and microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, we created mutant cesa proteins that lack catalytic activity but retain sufficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al integrity to allow assembly of the cellulose synthase complex. Using a series of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants and genetic backgrounds, we found consistent differences in the ability of these mutant cesa proteins to complement the cellulose-deficient phenotype of the <i>cesa</i> null mutants. The best complementation was observed with catalytically inactive cesa4, while the equivalent mutation in cesa8 exhibited significantly lower levels of complementation. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, including solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared microscopy, to study these mutant plants, we found evidence for changes in cellulose microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, but these changes largely correlated with cellulose content and reflected differences in the relative proportions of primary and secondary cell walls. Our results suggest that individual CESA classes have similar roles in determining cellulose microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, and it is likely that the different effects of mutating members of different CESA classes are the consequence of their different catalytic activity and their influence on the overall rate of cellulose synthesis.</p>

Functional Specialization of Cellulose Synthase Isoforms in a Moss Shows Parallels with Seed Plants
<p>The secondary cell walls of tracheary elements and fibers are rich in cellulose microfibrils that are helically oriented and laterally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aggreg</span></strong>ated. Support cells within the leaf midribs of mosses deposit cellulose-rich secondary cell walls, but their biosynthesis and microfibril organization have not been examined. Although the <i>Cellulose Synthase</i> (<i>CESA</i>) gene families of mosses and seed plants diversified independently, <i>CESA</i> knockout analysis in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> revealed parallels with Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in CESA functional specialization, with roles for both subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization. The similarities include regulatory uncoupling of the CESAs that synthesize primary and secondary cell walls, a requirement for two or more functionally distinct CESA isoforms for secondary cell wall synthesis, interchangeability of some primary and secondary CESAs, and some CESA redundancy. The cellulose-deficient midribs of <i>ppcesa3/8</i> knockouts provided negative controls for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al characterization of stereid secondary cell walls in wild type <i>P. patens</i>. Sum frequency generation spectra collected from midribs were consistent with cellulose microfibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aggreg</span></strong>ation, and polarization microscopy revealed helical microfibril orientation only in wild type leaves. Thus, stereid secondary walls are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ally distinct from primary cell walls, and they share <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al characteristics with the secondary walls of tracheary elements and fibers. We propose a mechanism for the convergent evolution of secondary walls in which the deposition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aggreg</span></strong>ated and helically oriented microfibrils is coupled to rapid and highly localized cellulose synthesis enabled by regulatory uncoupling from primary wall synthesis.</p>

The bacterial Ras/Rap1 site-specific endopeptidase RRSP cleaves Ras through an atypical mechanism to disrupt Ras-ERK signaling
<p>The Ras–extracellular signal–regulated kinase pathway is critical for controlling cell proliferation, and its aberrant activation drives the growth of various cancers. Because many pathogens produce toxins that inhibit Ras activity, efforts to develop effective Ras inhibitors to treat cancer could be informed by studies of Ras inhibition by pathogens. <i>Vibrio vulnificus</i> causes fatal infections in a manner that depends on multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin, a toxin that releases bacterial effector domains into host cells. One such domain is the Ras/Rap1-specific endopeptidase (RRSP), which site-specifically cleaves the Switch I domain of the small GTPases Ras and Rap1. We solved the crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of RRSP and found that its backbone shares a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al fold with the EreA/ChaN-like superfamily of enzymes. Unlike other proteases in this family, RRSP is not a metalloprotease. Through nuclear magnetic resonance analysis and nucleotide exchange assays, we determined that the processing of KRAS by RRSP did not release any fragments or cause KRAS to dissociate from its bound nucleotide but instead only locally affected its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e. However, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al alteration of KRAS was sufficient to disable guanine nucleotide exchange factor–mediated nucleotide exchange and prevent KRAS from binding to RAF. Thus, RRSP is a bacterial effector that represents a previously unrecognized class of protease that disconnects Ras from its signaling network while inducing limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al disturbance in its target.</p>

Volumetric additive manufacturing via tomographic reconstruction
<p>Additive manufacturing promises enormous geometrical freedom and the potential to combine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als for complex functions. The speed, geometry, and surface quality limitations of additive processes are linked to their reliance on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al layering. We demonstrated concurrent printing of all points within a three-dimensional object by illuminating a rotating volume of photosensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al with a dynamically evolving light pattern. We printed features as small as 0.3 millimeters in engineering acrylate polymers and printed soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es with exceptionally smooth surfaces into a gelatin methacrylate hydrogel. Our process enables us to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> components that encase other preexisting solid objects, allowing for multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al fabrication. We developed models to describe speed and spatial resolution capabilities and demonstrated printing times of 30 to 120 seconds for diverse centimeter-scale objects.</p>

Handedness in shearing auxetics creates rigid and compliant structures
<p>In nature, repeated base units produce handed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es that selectively bond to make rigid or compliant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. Auxetic tilings are scale-independent frameworks made from repeated unit cells that expand under tension. We discovered how to produce handedness in auxetic unit cells that shear as they expand by changing the symmetries and alignments of auxetic tilings. Using the symmetry and alignment rules that we developed, we made handed shearing auxetics that tile planes, cylinders, and spheres. By compositing the handed shearing auxetics in a manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es that expand while twisting and deployable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es that can rigidly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical frameworks, medical devices like stents, robotic systems, and deployable engineering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es.</p>

Lysosome activation clears aggregates and enhances quiescent neural stem cell activation during aging
<p>In the adult brain, the neural stem cell (NSC) pool comprises quiescent and activated populations with distinct roles. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that quiescent and activated NSCs exhibited differences in their protein homeostasis network. Whereas activated NSCs had active proteasomes, quiescent NSCs contained large lysosomes. Quiescent NSCs from young mice accumulated protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aggreg</span></strong>ates, and many of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aggreg</span></strong>ates were stored in large lysosomes. Perturbation of lysosomal activity in quiescent NSCs affected protein-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aggreg</span></strong>ate accumulation and the ability of quiescent NSCs to activate. During aging, quiescent NSCs displayed defects in their lysosomes, increased accumulation of protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aggreg</span></strong>ates, and reduced ability to activate. Enhancement of the lysosome pathway in old quiescent NSCs cleared protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aggreg</span></strong>ates and ameliorated the ability of quiescent NSCs to activate, allowing them to regain a more youthful state.</p>

Structure of the cold- and menthol-sensing ion channel TRPM8
<p>Transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) cation channels are polymodal sensors that are involved in a variety of physiological processes. Within the TRPM family, member 8 (TRPM8) is the primary cold and menthol sensor in humans. We determined the cryo–electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the full-length TRPM8 from the collared flycatcher at an overall resolution of ~4.1 ångstroms. Our TRPM8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals a three-layered architecture. The amino-terminal domain with a fold distinct among known TRP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, together with the carboxyl-terminal region, forms a large two-layered cytosolic ring that extensively interacts with the transmembrane channel layer. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e suggests that the menthol-binding site is located within the voltage-sensor–like domain and thus provides a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al glimpse of the design principle of the molecular transducer for cold and menthol sensation.</p>

The cytotoxic <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> PSMα3 reveals a cross-α amyloid-like fibril
<p>Amyloids are ordered protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aggreg</span></strong>ates, found in all kingdoms of life, and are involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aggreg</span></strong>ation diseases as well as in physiological activities. In microbes, functional amyloids are often key virulence determinants, yet the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al basis for their activity remains elusive. We determined the fibril <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e and function of the highly toxic, 22-residue phenol-soluble modulin α3 (PSMα3) peptide secreted by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. PSMα3 formed elongated fibrils that shared the morphological and tinctorial characteristics of canonical cross-β eukaryotic amyloids. However, the crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of full-length PSMα3, solved de novo at 1.45 angstrom resolution, revealed a distinctive “cross-α” amyloid-like architecture, in which amphipathic α helices stacked perpendicular to the fibril axis into tight self-associating sheets. The cross-α fibrillation of PSMα3 facilitated cytotoxicity, suggesting that this assembly mode underlies function in <i>S. aureus</i>.</p>

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy of an atomically thin material using a single-spin qubit
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als offer a promising platform for exploring condensed matter phenomena and developing technological applications. However, the reduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al dimensions to the atomic scale poses a challenge for traditional measurement and interfacing techniques that typically couple to macroscopic observables.

Coherent manipulation of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers enables the probing of nanoscale ensembles down to approximately 30 nuclear spins in atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The characterization of low-dimensional nanoscale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als could enable the development of new quantum hybrid systems, combining atomlike systems coherently coupled with individual atoms in 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Family of NAI2-Interacting Proteins in the Biogenesis of the ER Body and Related Structures
<p>Plants produce different types of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vesicles that accumulate and transport proteins, lipids, and metabolites. In the Brassicales, a distinct ER-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e called the ER body is found throughout the epidermis of cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. NAI2 is a key factor for ER body formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Homologs of NAI2 are found only in the Brassicales and therefore may have evolved specifically to enable ER body formation. Here, we report that three related Arabidopsis NAI2-interacting proteins (NAIP1, NAIP2, and NAIP3) play a critical role in the biogenesis of ER bodies and related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Analysis using GFP fusions revealed that all three NAIPs are components of the ER bodies found in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots. Genetic analysis with <i>naip</i> mutants indicates that they have a critical and redundant role in ER body formation. NAIP2 and NAIP3 are also components of other vesicular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es likely derived from the ER that are formed independent of NAI2 and are present not only in the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots, but also in the rosettes. Thus, while NAIP1 is a specialized ER body component, NAIP2 and NAIP3 are components of different types of ER-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. Analysis of chimeric NAIP proteins revealed that their N-terminal domains play a major role in the functional specialization between NAIP1 and NAIP3. Unlike NAI2, NAIPs have homologs in all plants; therefore, NAIP-containing ER <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es, from which the ER bodies in the Brassicales may have evolved, are likely to be present widely in plants.</p>

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A deeper understanding of the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is crucial in tailoring digestibility without sacrificing grain quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were identified through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e from grains of a 320 <i>indica</i> rice diversity panel using genotyping data from the high-density rice array. A systems genetics approach that interrelates starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network identified known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound Starch Synthase I</i> was identified along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with starch digestibility by determining the kinetics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with estimated digestibility kinetics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, systems genetics, and digestibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the digestibility of rice grain, thus offering rice consumers a new diet-based intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

Heart Failure Stages Among Older Adults in the Community
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects older adults, little data exist regarding the prevalence of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF stages among older individuals in the community.

Worse HF stage was associated with a greater risk of incident HF hospitalization or death at a median follow-up of 608 days. Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the sample from Stage A to B and improved the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e, systolic function (based on LV ejection fraction and longitudinal strain), and diastolic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with risk of incident HF hospitalization or death in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at risk for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based samples.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase, Ald4p, is a major component of mitochondrial fluorescent inclusion bodies in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>
<p>When <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> strain 3626 was cultured to the stationary phase in a medium that contained glucose, needle-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es that emitted autofluorescence were observed in almost all cells by fluorescence microscopy under UV excitation. The needle-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es completely overlapped with the profile of straight elongated mitochondria. Therefore, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es were designated as mitochondrial fluorescent inclusion bodies (MFIBs). The MFIB-enriched mitochondrial fractions were successfully isolated and 2D-gel electrophoresis revealed that a protein of 54 kDa was only highly concentrated in the fractions. Determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 54-kDa protein identified it as a mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, Ald4p. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that anti-Ald4p antibody specifically stained MFIBs. Freeze-substitution electron microscopy demonstrated that cells that retained MFIBs had electron-dense filamentous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es with a diameter of 10 nm in straight elongated mitochondria. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that Ald4p was localized to the electron-dense filamentous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es in mitochondria. These results together showed that a major component of MFIBs is Ald4p. In addition, we demonstrate that MFIBs are common features that appear in mitochondria of many species of yeast.</p>

Molecular structure of human P-glycoprotein in the ATP-bound, outward-facing conformation

Mechanically robust, readily repairable polymers via tailored noncovalent cross-linking
<p>Expanding the range of healable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als is an important challenge for sustainable societies. Noncrystalline, high-molecular-weight polymers generally form mechanically robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, which, however, are difficult to repair once they are fractured.

A key was to use thiourea, which anomalously forms a zigzag hydrogen-bonded array that does not induce unfavorable crystallization. Another key was to incorporate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al element for activating the exchange of hydrogen-bonded pairs, which enables the fractured portions to rejoin readily upon compression.</p>

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the cavities. Separate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base’s interactions.</p>

Experimental results and computations enabled us to measure the spatial correlations and strain response of softness, as well as two measures of plasticity: the size of rearrangements and the yield strain. All four quantities maintained remarkable commonality in their values for disordered packings of objects ranging from atoms to grains, spanning seven orders of magnitude in diameter and 13 orders of magnitude in elastic modulus. These commonalities link the spatial correlations and strain response of softness to rearrangement size and yield strain, respectively.</p>

Structural basis of bacterial transcription activation
<p>In bacteria, the activation of gene transcription at many promoters is simple and only involves a single activator. The cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate receptor protein (CAP), a classic activator, is able to activate transcription independently through two different mechanisms. Understanding the class I mechanism requires an intact transcription activation complex (TAC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e at a high resolution. Here we report a high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of an intact <i>Escherichia coli</i> class I TAC containing a CAP dimer, a σ<sup>70</sup>–RNA polymerase (RNAP) holoenzyme, a complete class I CAP-dependent promoter DNA, and a de novo synthesized RNA oligonucleotide. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e shows how CAP wraps the upstream DNA and how the interactions recruit RNAP. Our study provides a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al basis for understanding how activators activate transcription through the class I recruitment mechanism.</p>

Structures of the CRISPR genome integration complex
<p>CRISPR-Cas systems depend on the Cas1-Cas2 integrase to capture and integrate short foreign DNA fragments into the CRISPR locus, enabling adaptation to new viruses. We present crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of Cas1-Cas2 bound to both donor and target DNA in intermediate and product integration complexes, as well as a cryo–electron microscopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the full CRISPR locus integration complex, including the accessory protein IHF (integration host factor). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es show unexpectedly that indirect sequence recognition dictates integration site selection by favoring deformation of the repeat and the flanking sequences. IHF binding bends the DNA sharply, bringing an upstream recognition motif into contact with Cas1 to increase both the specificity and efficiency of integration. These results explain how the Cas1-Cas2 CRISPR integrase recognizes a sequence-dependent DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e to ensure site-selective CRISPR array expansion during the initial step of bacterial adaptive immunity.</p>

Two-dimensional sp<sup>2</sup> carbon–conjugated covalent organic frameworks
<p>We synthesized a two-dimensional (2D) crystalline covalent organic framework (sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF) that was designed to be fully π-conjugated and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed from all sp<sup>2</sup> carbons by C=C condensation reactions of tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene and 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile. The C=C linkages topologically connect pyrene knots at regular intervals into a 2D lattice with π conjugations extended along both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions and develop an eclipsed layer framework rather than the more conventionally obtained disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es. The sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF is a semiconductor with a discrete band gap of 1.9 electron volts and can be chemically oxidized to enhance conductivity by 12 orders of magnitude. The generated radicals are confined on the pyrene knots, enabling the formation of a paramagnetic carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e with high spin density. The sp<sup>2</sup> carbon framework induces ferromagnetic phase transition to develop spin-spin coherence and align spins unidirectionally across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al.</p>

Mechanism of transmembrane signaling by sensor histidine kinases
<p>One of the major and essential classes of transmembrane (TM) receptors, present in all domains of life, is sensor histidine kinases, parts of two-component signaling systems (TCSs). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al mechanisms of TM signaling by these sensors are poorly understood. We present crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of the periplasmic sensor domain, the TM domain, and the cytoplasmic HAMP domain of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> nitrate/nitrite sensor histidine kinase NarQ in the ligand-bound and mutated ligand-free states. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es reveal that the ligand binding induces rearrangements and pistonlike shifts of TM helices. The HAMP domain protomers undergo leverlike motions and convert these pistonlike motions into helical rotations. Our findings provide the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al framework for complete understanding of TM TCS signaling and for development of antimicrobial treatments targeting TCSs.</p>

Clathrate colloidal crystals
<p>DNA-programmable assembly has been used to deliberately synthesize hundreds of different colloidal crystals spanning dozens of symmetries, but the complexity of the achieved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es has so far been limited to small unit cells. We assembled DNA-modified triangular bipyramids (~250-nanometer long edge, 177-nanometer short edge) into clathrate architectures. Electron microscopy images revealed that at least three different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es form as large single-domain architectures or as multidomain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als. Ordered assemblies, iso<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al to clathrates, were identified with the help of molecular simulations and geometric analysis. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es are the most sophisticated architectures made via programmable assembly, and their formation can be understood based on the shape of the nanoparticle building blocks and mode of DNA functionalization.</p>

Hydrogen positions in single nanocrystals revealed by electron diffraction
<p>The localization of hydrogen atoms is an essential part of crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e analysis, but it is difficult because of their small scattering power. We report the direct localization of hydrogen atoms in nanocrystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>als, achieved using the recently developed approach of dynamical refinement of precession electron diffraction tomography data. We used this method to locate hydrogen atoms in both an organic (paracetamol) and an inorganic (framework cobalt aluminophosphate) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al. The results demonstrate that the technique can reliably reveal fine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al details, including the positions of hydrogen atoms in single crystals with micro- to nanosized dimensions.</p>

Cryo-EM structures and atomic model of the HIV-1 strand transfer complex intasome
<p>Like all retroviruses, HIV-1 irreversibly inserts a viral DNA (vDNA) copy of its RNA genome into host target DNA (tDNA). The intasome, a higher-order nucleoprotein complex composed of viral integrase (IN) and the ends of linear vDNA, mediates integration. Productive integration into host chromatin results in the formation of the strand transfer complex (STC) containing catalytically joined vDNA and tDNA. HIV-1 intasomes have been refractory to high-resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al studies. We used a soluble IN fusion protein to facilitate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>al studies, through which we present a high-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of the core tetrameric HIV-1 STC and a higher-order form that adopts carboxyl-terminal domain rearrangements. The distinct STC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es highlight how HIV-1 can use the common retroviral intasome core architecture to accommodate different IN domain modules for assembly.</p>

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions
<p>HIV-1 contains a cone-shaped capsid encasing the viral genome. This capsid is thought to follow fullerene geometry—a curved hexameric lattice of the capsid protein, CA, closed by incorporating 12 CA pentamers. Current models for core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e are based on crystallography of hexameric and cross-linked pentameric CA, electron microscopy of tubular CA arrays, and simulations. Here, we report subnanometer-resolution cryo–electron tomography <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of hexameric and pentameric CA within intact HIV-1 particles. Whereas the hexamer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e is compatible with crystallography studies, the pentamer forms using different interfaces. Determining multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es revealed how CA flexes to form the variably curved core shell. We show that HIV-1 CA assembles both aberrant and perfect fullerene cones, supporting models in which conical cores assemble de novo after maturation.</p>

Zika virus produces noncoding RNAs using a multi-pseudoknot structure that confounds a cellular exonuclease
<p>The outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) and associated fetal microcephaly mandates efforts to understand the molecular processes of infection. Related flaviviruses produce noncoding subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) that are linked to pathogenicity in fetal mice. These viruses make sfRNAs by co-opting a cellular exonuclease via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>ed RNAs called xrRNAs. We found that ZIKV-infected monkey and human epithelial cells, mouse neurons, and mosquito cells produce sfRNAs. The RNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e that is responsible for ZIKV sfRNA production forms a complex fold that is likely found in many pathogenic flaviviruses. Mutations that disrupt the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e affect exonuclease resistance in vitro and sfRNA formation during infection. The complete ZIKV xrRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e clarifies the mechanism of exonuclease resistance and identifies features that may modulate function in diverse flaviviruses.</p>

Gravity field of the Orientale basin from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory Mission
<p>The Orientale basin is the youngest and best-preserved major impact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e on the Moon. We used the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) spacecraft to investigate the gravitational field of Orientale at 3- to 5-kilometer (km) horizontal resolution. A volume of at least (3.4 ± 0.2) × 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>3</sup> of crustal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">materi</span></strong>al was removed and redistributed during basin formation. There is no preserved evidence of the transient crater that would reveal the basin’s maximum volume, but its diameter may now be inferred to be between 320 and 460 km. The gravity field resolves distinctive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>es of Orientale’s three rings and suggests the presence of faults associated with the outer two that penetrate to the mantle. The crustal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">structur</span></strong>e of Orientale provides constraints on the formation of multiring basins.</p>

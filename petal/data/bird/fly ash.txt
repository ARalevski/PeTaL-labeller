Methane production from coal by a single methanogen
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed methane is one of the largest unconventional natural gas resources. Although microbial activity may greatly contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed methane formation, it is unclear whether the complex aromatic organic compounds present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong> can be used for methanogenesis. We show that deep subsurface–derived <i>Methermicoccus</i> methanogens can produce methane from more than 30 types of methoxylated aromatic compounds (MACs) as well as from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>s containing MACs. In contrast to known methanogenesis pathways involving one- and two-carbon compounds, this “methoxydotrophic” mode of methanogenesis couples <i>O</i>-demethylation, CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, and possibly acetyl–coenzyme A metabolism. Because MACs derived from lignin may occur widely in subsurface sediments, methoxydotrophic methanogenesis would play an important role in the formation of natural gas not limited to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed methane and in the global carbon cycle.</p>

The balance between immunity and inflammation
<p>Lungs execute two critical functions that can be at odds with one another: eliminating harmful toxins, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particul</span></strong>ates, and microbes; and exchanging gas through uninflamed structures—alveoli—to collect oxygen and discharge carbon dioxide. Lungs have a multilayered response to unwanted invaders, offering physical barriers as well as arranging immune cells at airway surfaces. Yet, lungs have the “Goldilocks” challenge of deploying this armory with just the right amount of inflammation. Consequently, lung immunity must be choreographed so that invaders are purged quickly, inflammation tempered, and homeostasis preserved. In this issue, two papers reveal how lung immunity handles these tasks and what happens when things go awry. Shlezinger <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) on page 1037 unveil a clever trick that neutrophils play on inhaled fungal spores to resist life-threatening infections. This may reveal new treatment strategies. On page 1014, Sinclair <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report metabolic derangements in dendritic cells (DCs) that reprogram the allergic response to inhaled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particul</span></strong>ates, with implications for asthma.</p>

Particulate methane monooxygenase contains only mononuclear copper centers
<p>Bacteria that oxidize methane to methanol are central to mitigating emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The nature of the copper active site in the primary metabolic enzyme of these bacteria, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particul</span></strong>ate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), has been controversial owing to seemingly contradictory biochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic results. We present biochemical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic characterization most consistent with two monocopper sites within pMMO: one in the soluble PmoB subunit at the previously assigned active site (Cu<sub>B</sub>) and one ~2 nanometers away in the membrane-bound PmoC subunit (Cu<sub>C</sub>). On the basis of these results, we propose that a monocopper site is able to catalyze methane oxidation in pMMO.</p>

Innate immune recognition of glycans targets HIV nanoparticle immunogens to germinal centers
<p>In vaccine design, antigens are often arrayed in a multivalent nanoparticle form, but in vivo mechanisms underlying the enhanced immunity elicited by such vaccines remain poorly understood. We compared the fates of two different heavily glycosylated HIV antigens, a gp120-derived mini-protein and a large, stabilized envelope trimer, in protein nanoparticle or “free” forms after primary immunization. Unlike monomeric antigens, nanoparticles were rapidly shuttled to the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network and then concentrated in germinal centers in a complement-, mannose-binding lectin (MBL)–, and immunogen glycan–dependent manner. Loss of FDC localization in MBL-deficient mice or via immunogen deglycosylation significantly affected antibody responses. These findings identify an innate immune–mediated recognition pathway promoting antibody responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particul</span></strong>ate antigens, with broad implications for humoral immunity and vaccine design.</p>

Collective clog control: Optimizing traffic flow in confined biological and robophysical excavation
<p>Groups of interacting active particles, insects, or humans can form clusters that hinder the goals of the collective; therefore, development of robust strategies for control of such clogs is essential, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particul</span></strong>arly in confined environments. Our biological and robophysical excavation experiments, supported by computational and theoretical models, reveal that digging performance can be robustly optimized within the constraints of narrow tunnels by individual idleness and retreating. Tools from the study of dense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particul</span></strong>ate ensembles elucidate how idleness reduces the frequency of flow-stopping clogs and how selective retreating reduces cluster dissolution time for the rare clusters that still occur. Our results point to strategies by which dense active matter and swarms can become task capable without sophisticated sensing, planning, and global control of the collective.</p>

Volcanic tremor and plume height hysteresis from Pavlof Volcano, Alaska
<p>The March 2016 eruption of Pavlof Volcano, Alaska, produced an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ash</span></strong> plume that caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights in North America. The eruption generated strong tremor that was recorded by seismic and remote low-frequency acoustic (infrasound) stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array. The relationship between the tremor amplitudes and plume height changes considerably between the waxing and waning portions of the eruption. Similar hysteresis has been observed between seismic river noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and erosional processes in both rivers and volcanoes can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in geophysical data. We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the tremor source related to volcanic vent erosion. This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity.</p>

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">air pollut</span></strong>ion have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">air pollut</span></strong>ion exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">air pollut</span></strong>ion and heart disease mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particul</span></strong>ate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract. Proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals between PM<sub>2.5</sub> (per 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup>) and heart disease mortality using the full sample and the sample adults, which have information on additional health variables. Interaction terms were used to examine differences in the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mortality association by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 65 936 of the full sample died during follow-up, and 22 152 died from heart disease. After adjustment for several factors, we found a significant positive association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease mortality (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.25). This association was similar in sample adults with adjustment for smoking and body mass index (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.31). Interaction terms for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic groups compared with the non-Hispanic white group were not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Using a nationally representative sample, the association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease mortality was elevated and similar to previous estimates. Associations for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults were not statistically significantly different from those for non-Hispanic white adults.</p></sec>

Particulate Matter Exposure and Stress Hormone Levels
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Exposure to ambient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particul</span></strong>ate matter (PM) is associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, but potential mechanisms are largely unknown. Metabolomics represents a powerful approach to study global metabolic changes in response to environmental exposures. We therefore conducted this study to investigate changes in serum metabolites in response to the reduction of PM exposure among healthy college students.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized, double-blind crossover trial in 55 healthy college students in Shanghai, China. Real and sham air purifiers were placed in participants’ dormitories in random order for 9 days with a 12-day w<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ash</span></strong>out period. Serum metabolites were quantified by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Between-treatment differences in metabolites were examined using orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis and mixed-effect models. Secondary outcomes include blood pressure, corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, insulin resistance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average personal exposure to PMs with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm was 24.3 μg/m<sup>3</sup> during the real purification and 53.1 μg/m<sup>3</sup> during the sham purification. Metabolomics analysis showed that higher exposure to PMs with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm led to significant increases in cortisol, cortisone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Between-treatment differences were also observed for glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, and lipids. We found significantly higher blood pressure, hormones, insulin resistance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation among individuals exposed to higher PMs with aerodynamic diameters ≤2.5 μm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study suggests that higher PM may induce metabolic alterations that are consistent with activations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axes, adding potential mechanistic insights into the adverse health outcomes associated with PM. Furthermore, our study demonstrated short-term reductions in stress hormone following indoor air purification.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Potential Cardiovascular and Total Mortality Benefits of Air Pollution Control in Urban China
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Outdoor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">air pollut</span></strong>ion ranks fourth among preventable causes of China’s burden of disease. We hypothesized that the magnitude of health gains from air quality improvement in urban China could compare with achieving recommended blood pressure or smoking control goals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model–China projected coronary heart disease, stroke, and all-cause deaths in urban Chinese adults 35 to 84 years of age from 2017 to 2030 if recent air quality (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">particul</span></strong>ate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm, PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and traditional cardiovascular risk factor trends continue. We projected life-years gained if urban China were to reach 1 of 3 air quality goals: Beijing Olympic Games level (mean PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 55 μg/m<sup>3</sup>), China Class II standard (35 μg/m<sup>3</sup>), or World Health Organization standard (10 μg/m<sup>3</sup>). We compared projected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">air pollut</span></strong>ion reduction control benefits with potential benefits of reaching World Health Organization hypertension and tobacco control goals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction to Beijing Olympic levels by 2030 would gain ≈241,000 (95% uncertainty interval, 189 000–293 000) life-years annually. Achieving either the China Class II or World Health Organization PM<sub>2.5</sub> standard would yield greater health benefits (992 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 790 000–1 180 000] or 1 827 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 1 481 00–2 129 000] annual life-years gained, respectively) than World Health Organization–recommended goals of 25% improvement in systolic hypertension control and 30% reduction in smoking combined (928 000 [95% uncertainty interval, 830 000–1 033 000] life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Air quality improvement in different scenarios could lead to graded health benefits ranging from 241 000 life-years gained to much greater benefits equal to or greater than the combined benefits of 25% improvement in systolic hypertension control and 30% smoking reduction.</p></sec>

Plastid Translation Elongation Factor Tu Is Prone to Heat-Induced Aggregation Despite Its Critical Role in Plant Heat Tolerance
<p>Translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is a conserved GTP-binding protein essential for protein translation in prokaryotes and in eukaryotic mitochondria and plastids. EF-Tu also has a GTP/GDP-independent chaperone activity that may function in acclimation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plastid EF-Tu, Rabe1b, rapidly becomes insoluble at temperatures as low as 35°C in vitro and 41°C in vivo, with more than 90% aggregation after 9 h at 45°C in vivo. Based on its established function in protein translation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced aggregation likely inactivates Rabe1b. To determine the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced aggregation, we isolated an Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> knockdown mutant and discovered it to be highly compromised in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. Overexpression of constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant forms of Rabe1b in Arabidopsis and virus-induced silencing of <i>Rabe1b</i> in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) also reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. Compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance in the Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant and in the lines overexpressing constitutive GTP- or GDP-bound mutant Rabe1b proteins was associated with reduced plastid translation under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. The Arabidopsis <i>rabe1b</i> mutant also showed compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced expression of <i>HsfA2</i> and its target genes. Constitutive overexpression of HsfA2 activated its target genes but only partially restored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance of the <i>rabe1b</i> mutant. These results strongly suggest that the plastid protein EF-Tu is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> sensitive and acts as a critical limiting factor in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress responses, primarily functioning in plastid protein translation but also in protein folding and retrograde signaling of nuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-responsive gene expression.</p>

STABILIZED1 Modulates Pre-mRNA Splicing for Thermotolerance
<p>High-temperature stress often leads to differential RNA splicing, thus accumulating different types and/or amounts of mature mRNAs in eukaryotic cells. However, regulatory mechanisms underlying plant precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing in the environmental stress conditions remain elusive. Herein, we describe that a U5-snRNP-interacting protein homolog STABILIZED1 (STA1) has pre-mRNA splicing activity for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-inducible transcripts including <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> STRESS TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</i>s and various <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> SHOCK PROTEIN</i>s for the establishment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our cell-based splicing reporter assay demonstrated STA1 acts on pre-mRNA splicing for specific subsets of stress-related genes. Cellular reconstitution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-inducible transcription cascades supported the view that STA1-dependent pre-mRNA splicing plays a role in DREB2A-dependent <i>HSFA3</i> expression for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-responsive gene expression. Further genetic analysis with a loss-of-function mutant <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>, <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in Col background, and <i>STA1</i>-expressing transgenic plants in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background verified that STA1 is essential in expression of necessary genes including <i>HSFA3</i> for two-step <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress tolerance in plants. However, constitutive overexpression of the cDNA version of <i>HSFA3</i> in the <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i> background is unable to execute plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress tolerance in <i>sta1</i>-<i>1</i>. Consistently our global target analysis of STA1 showed that its splicing activity modulates a rather broad range of gene expression in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> treatment. The findings of this study reveal that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-inducible STA1 activity for pre-mRNA splicing serves as a molecular regulatory mechanism underlying the plant stress tolerance to high-temperature stress.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In addition, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In addition, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG accumulation during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in addition to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

Experimentally realized mechanochemistry distinct from force-accelerated scission of loaded bonds
<p>Stretching polymer chains accelerates dissociation of a variety of internal covalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s, to an extent that correlates well with the force experienced by the scissile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>. Recent theory has also predicted scenarios in which applied force accelerates dissociation of unloaded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s and kinetically strengthens strained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s. We report here unambiguous experimental validation of this hypothesis: Detailed kinetic measurements demonstrate that stretching phosphotriesters accelerates dissociation of the unloaded phosphorus-oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> orthogonal to the pulling axis, whereas stretching organosiloxanes inhibits dissociation of the aligned loaded silicon-oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s. Qualitatively, the outcome is determined by phosphoester elongation and siloxane contraction along the pulling axis in the respective rate-determining transition states. Quantitatively, the results agree with a simple mechanochemical kinetics model.</p>

Organometallic and radical intermediates reveal mechanism of diphthamide biosynthesis
<p>Diphthamide biosynthesis involves a carbon-carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>-forming reaction catalyzed by a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme that cleaves a carbon-sulfur (C–S) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> in SAM to generate a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) radical. Using rapid freezing, we have captured an organometallic intermediate with an iron-carbon (Fe–C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> between ACP and the enzyme’s [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the presence of the substrate protein, elongation factor 2, this intermediate converts to an organic radical, formed by addition of the ACP radical to a histidine side chain. Crystal structures of archaeal diphthamide biosynthetic radical SAM enzymes reveal that the carbon of the SAM C–S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> being cleaved is positioned near the unique cluster Fe, able to react with the cluster. Our results explain how selective C–S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> cleavage is achieved in this radical SAM enzyme.</p>

Metalloprotein entatic control of ligand-metal bonds quantified by ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy
<p>The multifunctional protein cytochrome c (cyt c) plays key roles in electron transport and apoptosis, switching function by modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ing between a heme iron and the sulfur in a methionine residue. This Fe–S(Met) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> is too weak to persist in the absence of protein constraints. We ruptured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> in ferrous cyt c using an optical laser pulse and monitored the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> reformation within the protein active site using ultrafast x-ray pulses from an x-ray free-electron laser, determining that the Fe–S(Met) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> enthalpy is ~4 kcal/mol stronger than in the absence of protein constraints. The 4 kcal/mol is comparable with calculations of stabilization effects in other systems, demonstrating how biological systems use an entatic state for modest yet accessible energetics to modulate chemical function.</p>

Bioorthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) Enables Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein Synthesis in Native Plant Tissue
<p>Proteomic plasticity undergirds stress responses in plants, and understanding such responses requires accurate measurement of the extent to which proteins levels are adjusted to counter external stimuli. Here, we adapt bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to interrogate protein synthesis in vegetative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. BONCAT relies on the translational incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid probe into cellular proteins. In this study, the probe is the Met surrogate azidohomoalanine (Aha), which carries a reactive azide moiety in its amino acid side chain. The azide handle in Aha can be selectively conjugated to dyes and functionalized beads to enable visualization and enrichment of newly synthesized proteins. We show that BONCAT is sensitive enough to detect Arabidopsis proteins synthesized within a 30-min interval defined by an Aha pulse and that the method can be used to detect proteins made under conditions of light stress, osmotic shock, salt stress, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, and recovery from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. We further establish that BONCAT can be coupled to tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins synthesized during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress and recovery from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Our results are consistent with a model in which, upon the onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress, translation is rapidly reprogrammed to enhance the synthesis of stress mitigators and is again altered during recovery. All experiments were carried out with commercially available reagents, highlighting the accessibility of the BONCAT method to researchers interested in stress responses as well as translational and posttranslational regulation in plants.</p>

Evolutionary capacity of upper thermal limits: beyond single trait assessments
<p>Thermal tolerance is an important factor influencing the distribution of ectotherms, but we still have limited understanding of the ability of species to evolve different thermal limits. Recent studies suggest that species may have limited capacity to evolve higher thermal limits in response to slower, more ecologically relevant rates of warming. However, these conclusions are based on univariate estimates of adaptive capacity. To test these findings within an explicitly multivariate context, we used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to estimate the multivariate evolutionary potential for upper thermal limits in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We assessed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance using static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero only for the static measures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. Our <bold>G</bold> matrix analysis revealed that any response to selection for increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance will largely be driven by static basal and hardened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance, with minimal contribution from ramping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance. These results suggest that the capacity to evolve upper thermal limits in nature may depend on the type of thermal stress experienced.</p>

Imaging the halogen bond in self-assembled halogenbenzenes on silver

Vinculin forms a directionally asymmetric catch bond with F-actin
<p>Vinculin is an actin-binding protein thought to reinforce cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. However, how mechanical load affects the vinculin–F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> is unclear. Using a single-molecule optical trap assay, we found that vinculin forms a force-dependent catch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> with F-actin through its tail domain, but with lifetimes that depend strongly on the direction of the applied force. Force toward the pointed (–) end of the actin filament resulted in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> that was maximally stable at 8 piconewtons, with a mean lifetime (12 seconds) 10 times as long as the mean lifetime when force was applied toward the barbed (+) end. A computational model of lamellipodial actin dynamics suggests that the directionality of the vinculin–F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> could establish long-range order in the actin cytoskeleton. The directional and force-stabilized binding of vinculin to F-actin may be a mechanism by which adhesion complexes maintain front-rear asymmetry in migrating cells.</p>

Coordination-induced weakening of ammonia, water, and hydrazine X–H bonds in a molybdenum complex
<p>Although scores of transition metal complexes incorporating ammonia or water ligands have been characterized over the past century, little is known about how coordination influences the strength of the nitrogen-hydrogen and oxygen-hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s.

Glucose-Regulated <i>HLP1</i> Acts as a Key Molecule in Governing Thermomemory
<p>Induction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> shock proteins (HSPs) in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress (HS) is indispensable for conferring thermotolerance. Glc, a fundamental signaling and metabolic molecule, provides energy to stressed seedlings to combat stress. The recovery of stressed plants from detrimental HS in response to Glc is largely mediated by HSPs, but the mechanistic basis of this thermotolerance is not well defined. In this study, we show that Glc has a prominent role in providing thermotolerance. Glc-mediated thermotolerance involves HSP induction via the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR)-E2Fa signaling module. Apart from HSPs, TOR-E2Fa also regulates the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ortholog of human <i>Hikeshi</i>, named <i>HIKESHI</i>-<i>LIKE PROTEIN1</i> (<i>HLP1</i>). Expression of <i>proHLP1</i>::<i>GUS</i> in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) after HS coincides with TOR-E2Fa expression, substantiating a role for TOR-E2Fa-HLP1 in providing thermotolerance. We also demonstrate that Glc along with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> could induce proliferation activity in the SAM after HS recovery, which was arrested by the TOR inhibitor AZD-8055. Molecular and physiological studies suggest that HS-activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress transcription factor A1s also positively regulate <i>HLP1</i> transcription, suggesting convergence of the Glc and HS signaling pathways. Loss of functional HLP1 causes HS hypersensitivity, whereas HLP1 overexpressors display increased thermotolerance. HLP1 binds to the promoters of Glc-regulated HS-responsive genes and promotes chromatin acetylation. In addition, Glc modifies the chromatin landscape at thermomemory-related loci by promoting H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Glc-primed accumulation of H3K4me3 at thermomemory-associated loci is mediated through HLP1. These findings reveal the novel function of Glc-regulated <i>HLP1</i> in mediating thermotolerance/thermomemory response.</p>

The Pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 Sustains Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> Biosynthesis as a Function of Heat Stress<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants sense temperature changes and respond by altering growth and metabolic activity to acclimate to the altered environmental conditions. The B vitamins give rise to vital coenzymes that are indispensable for growth and development but their inherent reactive nature renders them prone to destruction especially under stress conditions. Therefore, plant survival strategies would be expected to include mechanisms to sustain B vitamin supply under demanding circumstances. Here, using the example of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, we investigate the regulation of biosynthesis across eudicot and monocot species under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Most eudicots carry a pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 that is a noncatalytic homolog of the PDX1 subunit of the vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis protein machinery, PYRIDOXINE BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN1. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) as models, we show that <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> is transcriptionally regulated by the HSFA1 transcription factor family. Monocots only carry catalytic <i>PDX1</i> homologs that do not respond to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress as demonstrated for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis across the two lineages. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> transcription reveals two alternative transcriptional start sites, one of which is exclusive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress. Further data suggest that PDX1.2 leads to stabilization of the catalytic PDX1s under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress conditions, which would serve to maintain vitamin B<sub>6</sub> homeostasis in times of need in eudicots that carry this gene. Our analyses indicate an important abiotic stress tolerance strategy in several eudicots, which has not been evolutionarily adapted (or is not required) by monocots such as grasses.</p>

Integrating Omics and Alternative Splicing Reveals Insights into Grape Response to High Temperature
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress is one of the primary abiotic stresses that limit crop production. Grape (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a cultivated fruit with high economic value throughout the world, with its growth and development often influenced by high temperature. Alternative splicing (AS) is a widespread phenomenon increasing transcriptome and proteome diversity. We conducted high-temperature treatments (35°C, 40°C, and 45°C) on grapevines and assessed transcriptomic (especially AS) and proteomic changes in leaves. We found that nearly 70% of the genes were alternatively spliced under high temperature. Intron retention (IR), exon skipping, and alternative donor/acceptor sites were markedly induced under different high temperatures. Among all differential AS events, IR was the most abundant up- and down-regulated event. Moreover, the occurrence frequency of IR events at 40°C and 45°C was far higher than at 35°C. These results indicated that AS, especially IR, is an important posttranscriptional regulatory event during grape leaf responses to high temperature. Proteomic analysis showed that protein levels of the RNA-binding proteins SR45, SR30, and SR34 and the nuclear ribonucleic protein U1A gradually rose as ambient temperature increased, which revealed a reason why AS events occurred more frequently under high temperature. After integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> shock proteins and some important transcription factors such as MULTIPROTEIN BRIDGING FACTOR1c and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A2 were involved mainly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance in grape through up-regulating transcriptional (especially modulated by AS) and translational levels. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence for grape leaf responses to high temperature at simultaneous transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels.</p>

Electrified methane reforming: A compact approach to greener industrial hydrogen production
<p>Electrification of conventionally fired chemical reactors has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and provide flexible and compact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> generation. Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>ed catalytic structure directly into a steam-methane–reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production. Intimate contact between the electric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases catalyst utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated design with small characteristic length scales allows compact reactor designs, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer platforms. Electrification of SMR offers a strong platform for new reactor design, scale, and implementation opportunities. Implemented on a global scale, this could correspond to a reduction of nearly 1% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

<p>Common anionic nucleophiles such as those derived from inorganic salts have not been used for enantioselective catalysis because of their insolubility. Here, we report that merging hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ing and phase-transfer catalysis provides an effective mode of activation for nucleophiles that are insoluble in organic solvents. This catalytic manifold relies on hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ing complexation to render nucleophiles soluble and reactive, while simultaneously inducing asymmetry in the ensuing transformation. We demonstrate the concept using a chiral bis-urea catalyst to form a tridentate hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ing complex with fluoride from its cesium salt, thereby enabling highly efficient enantioselective ring opening of episulfonium ion. This fluorination method is synthetically valuable considering the scarcity of alternative protocols and points the way to wider application of the catalytic approach with diverse anionic nucleophiles.</p>

Mechanically robust, readily repairable polymers via tailored noncovalent cross-linking
<p>Expanding the range of healable materials is an important challenge for sustainable societies. Noncrystalline, high-molecular-weight polymers generally form mechanically robust materials, which, however, are difficult to repair once they are fractured. This is because their polymer chains are heavily entangled and diffuse too sluggishly to unite fractured surfaces within reasonable time scales. Here we report that low-molecular-weight polymers, when cross-linked by dense hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s, yield mechanically robust yet readily repairable materials, despite their extremely slow diffusion dynamics. A key was to use thiourea, which anomalously forms a zigzag hydrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ed array that does not induce unfavorable crystallization. Another key was to incorporate a structural element for activating the exchange of hydrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ed pairs, which enables the fractured portions to rejoin readily upon compression.</p>

Lewis acid enhancement by hydrogen-bond donors for asymmetric catalysis
<p>Small-molecule dual hydrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> (H-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>) donors such as ureas, thioureas, squaramides, and guanidinium ions enjoy widespread use as effective catalysts for promoting a variety of enantioselective reactions. However, these catalysts are only weakly acidic and therefore require highly reactive electrophilic substrates to be effective. We introduce here a mode of catalytic activity with chiral H-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> donors that enables enantioselective reactions of relatively unreactive electrophiles. Squaramides are shown to interact with silyl triflates by binding the triflate counterion to form a stable, yet highly Lewis acidic, complex. The silyl triflate-chiral squaramide combination promotes the generation of oxocarbenium intermediates from acetal substrates at low temperatures. Enantioselectivity in nucleophile additions to the cationic intermediates is then controlled through a network of noncovalent interactions between the squaramide catalyst and the oxocarbenium triflate.</p>

Highly efficient electrocaloric cooling with electrostatic actuation
<p>Solid-state refrigeration offers potential advantages over traditional cooling systems, but few devices offer high specific cooling power with a high coefficient of performance (COP) and the ability to be applied directly to surfaces. We developed a cooling device with a high intrinsic thermodynamic efficiency using a flexible electrocaloric (EC) polymer film and an electrostatic actuation mechanism. Reversible electrostatic forces reduce parasitic power consumption and allow efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> transfer through good thermal contacts with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> source or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> sink. The EC device produced a specific cooling power of 2.8 watts per gram and a COP of 13. The new cooling device is more efficient and compact than existing surface-conformable solid-state cooling technologies, opening a path to using the technology for a variety of practical applications.</p>

Low-temperature activation of methane on the IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface
<p>Methane undergoes highly facile C–H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> cleavage on the stoichiometric IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface. From temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy experiments, we found that methane molecularly adsorbed as a strongly bound σ complex on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) and that a large fraction of the adsorbed complexes underwent C–H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> cleavage at temperatures as low as 150 kelvin (K). The initial dissociation probability of methane on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) decreased from 80 to 20% with increasing surface temperature from 175 to 300 K. We estimate that the activation energy for methane C–H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> cleavage is 9.5 kilojoule per mole (kJ/mol) lower than the binding energy of the adsorbed precursor on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110), and equal to a value of ~28.5 kJ/mol. Low-temperature activation may avoid unwanted side reactions in the development of catalytic processes to selectively convert methane to value-added products.</p>

Spectroscopic snapshots of the proton-transfer mechanism in water
<p>The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high proton mobility in water as a sequence of proton transfers along a hydrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ed (H-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ed) network. However, the vibrational spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk water. Here we report how the much simpler vibrational spectra of cold, composition-selected heavy water clusters, D<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<i><sub>n</sub></i>, can be exploited to capture clear markers that encode the collective reaction coordinate along the proton-transfer event. By complexing the solvated hydronium “Eigen” cluster [D<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(D<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>] with increasingly strong H-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> acceptor molecules (D<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO, and D<sub>2</sub>O), we are able to track the frequency of every O-D stretch vibration in the complex as the transferring hydron is incrementally pulled from the central hydronium to a neighboring water molecule.</p>

Directed evolution of cytochrome c for carbon–silicon bond formation: Bringing silicon to life

The reaction proceeds both in vitro and in vivo, accommodating a broad range of substrates with high chemo- and enantioselectivity. Using directed evolution, we enhanced the catalytic function of cytochrome c from <i>Rhodothermus marinus</i> to achieve more than 15-fold higher turnover than state-of-the-art synthetic catalysts.

An artificial metalloenzyme with the kinetics of native enzymes
<p>Natural enzymes contain highly evolved active sites that lead to fast rates and high selectivities. Although artificial metalloenzymes have been developed that catalyze abiological transformations with high stereoselectivity, the activities of these artificial enzymes are much lower than those of natural enzymes. Here, we report a reconstituted artificial metalloenzyme containing an iridium porphyrin that exhibits kinetic parameters similar to those of natural enzymes. In particular, variants of the P450 enzyme CYP119 containing iridium in place of iron catalyze insertions of carbenes into C–H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s with up to 98% enantiomeric excess, 35,000 turnovers, and 2550 hours<sup>−1</sup> turnover frequency. This activity leads to intramolecular carbene insertions into unactivated C–H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s and intermolecular carbene insertions into C–H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s. These results lift the restrictions on merging chemical catalysis and biocatalysis to create highly active, productive, and selective metalloenzymes for abiological reactions.</p>

Mechanisms of reef coral resistance to future climate change
<p>Reef corals are highly sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>, yet populations resistant to climate change have recently been identified. To determine the mechanisms of temperature tolerance, we reciprocally transplanted corals between reef sites experiencing distinct temperature regimes and tested subsequent physiological and gene expression profiles. Local acclimatization and fixed effects, such as adaptation, contributed about equally to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance and are reflected in patterns of gene expression. In less than 2 years, acclimatization achieves the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance that we would expect from strong natural selection over many generations for these long-lived organisms. Our results show both short-term acclimatory and longer-term adaptive acquisition of climate resistance. Adding these adaptive abilities to ecosystem models is likely to slow predictions of demise for coral reef ecosystems.</p>

Melting of Iron at Earth’s Inner Core Boundary Based on Fast X-ray Diffraction

Alternative Oxidase Capacity of Mitochondria in Microsporophylls May Function in Cycad Thermogenesis
<p>Cone thermogenesis is a widespread phenomenon in cycads and may function to promote volatile emissions that affect pollinator behavior. Given their large population size and intense and durable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-producing effects, cycads are important organisms for comprehensive studies of plant thermogenesis. However, knowledge of mitochondrial morphology and function in cone thermogenesis is limited. Therefore, we investigated these mitochondrial properties in the thermogenic cycad species <i>Cycas revoluta</i>. Male cones generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> even in cool weather conditions. Female cones produced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>, but to a lesser extent than male cones. Ultrastructural analyses of the two major tissues of male cones, microsporophylls and microsporangia, revealed the existence of a population of mitochondria with a distinct morphology in the microsporophylls. In these cells, we observed large mitochondria (cross-sectional area of 2 μm<sup>2</sup> or more) with a uniform matrix density that occupied >10% of the total mitochondrial volume. Despite the size difference, many nonlarge mitochondria (cross-sectional area <2 μm<sup>2</sup>) also exhibited a shape and a matrix density similar to those of large mitochondria. Alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and expression levels in microsporophylls were much higher than those in microsporangia. The <i>AOX</i> genes expressed in male cones revealed two different <i>AOX</i> complementary DNA sequences: <i>CrAOX1</i> and <i>CrAOX2</i>. The expression level of <i>CrAOX1</i> mRNA in the microsporophylls was 100 times greater than that of <i>CrAOX2</i> mRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that distinctive mitochondrial morphology and CrAOX1-mediated respiration in microsporophylls might play a role in cycad cone thermogenesis.</p>

Etiolated Stem Branching Is a Result of Systemic Signaling Associated with Sucrose Level
<p>The potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) tuber is a swollen stem. Sprouts growing from the tuber nodes represent loss of apical dominance and branching. Long cold storage induces loss of tuber apical dominance and results in secondary branching. Here, we show that a similar branching pattern can be induced by short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> treatment of the tubers. Detached sprouts were induced to branch by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> treatment only when attached to a parenchyma cylinder. Grafting experiments showed that the scion branches only when grafted onto <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>- or cold-treated tuber parenchyma, suggesting that the branching signal is transmitted systemically from the bud-base parenchyma to the grafted stem. Exogenous supply of sucrose (Suc), glucose, or fructose solution to detached sprouts induced branching in a dose-responsive manner, and an increase in Suc level was observed in tuber parenchyma upon branching induction, suggesting a role for elevated parenchyma sugars in the regulation of branching. However, sugar analysis of the apex and node after grafting showed no distinct differences in sugar levels between branching and nonbranching stems. Vacuolar invertase is a key enzyme in determining the level of Suc and its cleavage products, glucose and fructose, in potato parenchyma. Silencing of the vacuolar invertase-encoding gene led to increased tuber branching in combination with branching-inducing treatments. These results suggest that Suc in the parenchyma induces branching through signaling and not by excess mobilization from the parenchyma to the stem.</p>

Quantifying Wheat Sensitivities to Environmental Constraints to Dissect Genotype × Environment Interactions in the Field
<p>Yield is subject to strong genotype-by-environment (G × E) interactions in the field, especially under abiotic constraints such as soil water deficit (drought [D]) and high temperature (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> [H]). Since environmental conditions show strong fluctuations during the whole crop cycle, geneticists usually do not consider environmental measures as quantitative variables but rather as factors in multienvironment analyses. Based on 11 experiments in a field platform with contrasting temperature and soil water deficit, we determined the periods of sensitivity to drought and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> constraints in w<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and determined the average sensitivities for major yield components. G × E interactions were separated into their underlying components, constitutive genotypic effect (G), G × D, G × H, and G × H × D, and were analyzed for two genotypes, highlighting contrasting responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> and drought constraints. We then tested the constitutive and responsive behaviors of two strong quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated previously with yield components. This analysis confirmed the constitutive effect of the chromosome 1B QTL and explained the G × E interaction of the chromosome 3B QTL by a benefit of one allele when temperature rises. In addition to the method itself, which can be applied to other data sets and populations, this study will support the cloning of a major yield QTL on chromosome 3B that is highly dependent on environmental conditions and for which the climatic interaction is now quantified.</p>

PECTIN METHYLESTERASE34 Contributes to Heat Tolerance through Its Role in Promoting Stomatal Movement
<p>Pectin, a major component of the primary cell wall, is synthesized in the Golgi apparatus and exported to the cell wall in a highly methylesterified form, then is partially demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; EC 3.1.1.11). PME activity on the status of pectin methylesterification profoundly affects the properties of pectin and, thereby, is critical for plant development and the plant defense response, although the roles of PMEs under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress (HS) are poorly understood. Functional genome annotation predicts that at least 66 potential <i>PME</i> genes are contained in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Thermotolerance assays of <i>PME</i> gene T-DNA insertion lines revealed two null mutant alleles of <i>PME34</i> (At3g49220) that both consistently showed reduced thermotolerance. Nevertheless, their impairment was independently associated with the expression of HS-responsive genes. It was also observed that <i>PME34</i> transcription was induced by abscisic acid and highly expressed in guard cells. We showed that the <i>PME34</i> mutation has a defect in the control of stomatal movement and greatly altered PME and polygalacturonase (EC 3.2.1.15) activity, resulting in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>-sensitive phenotype. <i>PME34</i> has a role in the regulation of transpiration through the control of the stomatal aperture due to its cell wall-modifying enzyme activity during the HS response. Hence, PME34 is required for regulating guard cell wall flexibility to mediate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> response in Arabidopsis.</p>

Lineage-Specific Transcriptional Profiles of <i>Symbiodinium</i> spp. Unaltered by Heat Stress in a Coral Host
<p>Dinoflagellates of the genus <i>Symbiodinium</i> form an endosymbiosis with reef building corals, in which photosynthetically derived nutrients comprise the majority of the coral energy budget. An extraordinary amount of functional and genetic diversity is contained within the coral-associated <i>Symbiodinium,</i> with some phylotypes (i.e., genotypic groupings), conferring enhanced stress tolerance to host corals. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have enabled transcriptome-wide profiling of the stress response of the cnidarian coral host; however, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular response to stress of coral-associated <i>Symbiodinium,</i> as well as differences among physiologically susceptible and tolerant types, remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine the transcriptome-wide response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> stress via RNA-Seq of two types of <i>Symbiodinium,</i> the putatively thermotolerant type D2 and the more susceptible type C3K, resident within the same coral host species, <i>Acropora hyacinthus</i>. Contrary to previous findings with coral hosts, we find no detectable change in gene expression across the dinoflagellate transcriptome after 3 days of elevated thermal exposure, despite physical evidence of symbiosis breakdown. However, hundreds of genes identified as orthologs between the C and D types exhibited significant expression differences within treatments (i.e., attributable solely to type, not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> exposure). These include many genes related to known thermotolerance mechanisms including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> shock proteins and chloroplast membrane components. Additionally, both the between-treatment similarities and between-type differences remained pervasive after 12–18 months of common garden acclimation and in mixed <i>Symbiodinium</i> assemblages within the same coral host colony.</p>

Invasion and adaptation of a warm-adapted species to montane localities: effect of acclimation potential
<p><i>Drosophila ananassae</i> has successfully invaded the cold and dry montane localities of the Western Himalayas in recent years. The ability of this desiccation- and cold-sensitive tropical species to evolve in response to seasonal changes in montane localities is largely unknown. Here, we investigated how this sensitive species adapt to seasonally varying environmental conditions that are lethal to its survival. We observed change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i> in five mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000–2010). We document invasion of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities and increase in frequency of the dark morph. The stress tolerance of morphs (dark and light) remained unaffected of developmental acclimation. However, adult acclimation has shown significant effects on tolerance to various environmental stresses in morphs and effect of this acclimation persist for long durations. Desiccation and cold stress tolerance was increased after adult acclimation for respective stress in the dark morph; while tolerance of the light morph was not affected. Further, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance of the light morph was increased after adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> acclimation with no influence on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> tolerance of the dark morph. Our results suggest a possible role of adult acclimation in successful invasion and adaptation of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities. Future experiments should be carried out to determine whether the survival in adverse conditions of low <i>versus</i> high temperature and humidity during seasonal changes is assisted by different acclimation abilities of the two morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i>.</p>

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The structure reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>ing networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that separate the cavities. Separate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T structure reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base’s interactions.</p>

Results show that although zircons resided in the magmatic system for 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> years, they experienced temperatures >650° to 750°C for only years to centuries. This implies near-solidus long-term crystal storage, punctuated by rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong>ing and cooling. Reconciling these data with existing models of magma storage requires considering multiple small intrusions and multiple spatial scales, and our approach can help to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">heat</span></strong> input to and output from magma reservoirs.</p>

Palladium-catalyzed carbon-sulfur or carbon-phosphorus bond metathesis by reversible arylation
<p>Compounds bearing aryl-sulfur and aryl-phosphorus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s have found numerous applications in drug development, organic materials, polymer science, and homogeneous catalysis. We describe palladium-catalyzed metathesis reactions of both compound classes, each of which proceeds through a reversible arylation manifold. The synthetic power and immediate utility of this approach are demonstrated in several applications that would be challenging to achieve by means of traditional cross-coupling methods. The C(sp<sup>2</sup>)–S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> metathesis protocol was used in the depolymerization of a commercial thermoplastic polymer and in the late-stage derivatization of a drug. The C(sp<sup>2</sup>)–P variant led to the convenient preparation of a variety of phosphorus heterocycles, including a potential chiral ligand and fluorescent organic materials, via a ring-closing transformation.</p>

High-performance vitrimers from commodity thermoplastics through dioxaborolane metathesis
<p>Windmills, cars, and dental restoration demand polymer materials and composites that are easy to process, assemble, and recycle while exhibiting outstanding mechanical, thermal, and chemical resistance. Vitrimers, which are polymer networks able to shuffle chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s through exchange reactions, could address these demands if they were prepared from existing plastics and processed with fast production rates and current equipment. We report the metathesis of dioxaborolanes, which is rapid and thermally robust, and use it to prepare vitrimers from polymers as different as poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, and high-density polyethylene that, although permanently cross-linked, can be processed multiple times by means of extrusion or injection molding. They show superior chemical resistance and dimensional stability and can be efficiently assembled. The strategy is applicable to polymers with backbones made of carbon-carbon single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s.</p>

A general, modular method for the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of alkylboronate esters
<p>Alkylboron compounds are an important family of target molecules, serving as useful intermediates, as well as end points, in fields such as pharmaceutical science and organic chemistry. Facile transformation of carbon-boron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s into a wide variety of carbon-X <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s (where X is, for example, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, or a halogen), with stereochemical fidelity, renders the generation of enantioenriched alkylboronate esters a powerful tool in synthesis. Here we report the use of a chiral nickel catalyst to achieve stereoconvergent alkyl-alkyl couplings of readily available racemic α-haloboronates with organozinc reagents under mild conditions. We demonstrate that this method provides straightforward access to a diverse array of enantioenriched alkylboronate esters, in which boron is bound to a stereogenic carbon, and we highlight the utility of these compounds in synthesis.</p>

Posttranslational mutagenesis: A chemical strategy for exploring protein side-chain diversity
<p>Posttranslational modification of proteins expands their structural and functional capabilities beyond those directly specified by the genetic code. However, the vast diversity of chemically plausible (including unnatural but functionally relevant) side chains is not readily accessible. We describe C (sp<sup>3</sup>)–C (sp<sup>3</sup>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>-forming reactions on proteins under biocompatible conditions, which exploit unusual carbon free-radical chemistry, and use them to form Cβ–Cγ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s with altered side chains. We demonstrate how these transformations enable a wide diversity of natural, unnatural, posttranslationally modified (methylated, glycosylated, phosphorylated, hydroxylated), and labeled (fluorinated, isotopically labeled) side chains to be added to a common, readily accessible dehydroalanine precursor in a range of representative protein types and scaffolds. This approach, outside of the rigid constraints of the ribosome and enzymatic processing, may be modified more generally for access to diverse proteins.</p>

Molecular architecture of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> activated spliceosome
<p>The activated spliceosome (B<sup>act</sup>) is in a catalytically inactive state and is remodeled into a catalytically active machine by the RNA helicase Prp2, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we describe a 3D electron cryomicroscopy structure of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> B<sup>act</sup> complex at 5.8-angstrom resolution. Our model reveals that in B<sup>act</sup>, the catalytic U2/U6 RNA-Prp8 ribonucleoprotein core is already established, and the 5′ splice site (ss) is oriented for step 1 catalysis but occluded by protein. The first-step nucleophile—the branchsite adenosine—is sequestered within the Hsh155 HEAT domain and is held 50 angstroms away from the 5′ss. Our structure suggests that Prp2 adenosine triphosphatase–mediated remodeling leads to conformational changes in Hsh155’s HEAT domain that liberate the first-step reactants for catalysis.</p>

Hydroxystilbenes Are Monomers in Palm Fruit Endocarp Lignins
<p>Lignin, the plant cell wall polymer that binds fibers together but makes processing difficult, is traditionally formed from three monomers, the so-called monolignols (<i>p</i>-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols). Recently, we discovered, in grass lignins, a phenolic monomer that falls outside the canonical lignin biosynthetic pathway, the flavone tricin. As we show here, palm fruit (macaéíéííéíúba [<i>Acrocomia aculeata</i>], carnauba [<i>Copernicia prunifera</i>], and coconut [<i>Cocos nucifera</i>]) endocarps contain lignin polymers derived in part from a previously unconsidered class of lignin monomers, the hydroxystilbenes, including the valuable compounds piceatannol and resveratrol. Piceatannol could be released from these lignins upon derivatization followed by reductive cleavage, a degradative method that cleaves β-ether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s, indicating that at least a fraction is incorporated through labile ether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of products from the copolymerization of piceatannol and monolignols confirms the structures in the natural polymer and demonstrates that piceatannol acts as an authentic monomer participating in coupling and cross-coupling reactions during lignification. Therefore, palm fruit endocarps contain a new class of stilbenolignin polymers, further expanding the definition of lignin and implying that compounds such as piceatannol and resveratrol are potentially available in what is now essentially a waste product.</p>

Heat Shock Protein HSP101 Affects the Release of Ribosomal Protein mRNAs for Recovery after Heat Shock
<p>Heat shock (HS) is known to have a profound impact on gene expression at different levels, such as inhibition of protein synthesis, in which HS blocks translation initiation and induces the sequestration of mRNAs into stress granules (SGs) or P-bodies for storage and/or decay. SGs prevent the degradation of the stored mRNAs, which can be reengaged into translation in the recovery period. However, little is known on the mRNAs stored during the stress, how these mRNAs are released from SGs afterward, and what the functional importance is of this process. In this work, we report that Arabidopsis <i>HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101</i> (<i>HSP101</i>) knockout mutant (<i>hsp101</i>) presented a defect in translation recovery and SG dissociation after HS. Using RNA sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation approaches, we show that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) were preferentially stored during HS and that these mRNAs were released and translated in an HSP101-dependent manner during recovery. By <sup>15</sup>N incorporation and polysome profile analyses, we observed that these released mRNAs contributed to the production of new ribosomes to enhance translation. We propose that, after HS, HSP101 is required for the efficient release of RP mRNAs from SGs resulting in a rapid restoration of the translation machinery by producing new RPs.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation can limit the impact of water stress on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> growth through reduced transpiration demand by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> canopy partly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ated and that (ii) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation and water stress on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> growth under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Chemical responses to modified lignin composition in tension wood of hybrid poplar (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i>)
<p>The effect of altering the expression level of the <i>F5H</i> gene was investigated in three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> tissues (normal, opposite and tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>) in 1-year-old hybrid poplar clone 717 (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i> L.), containing the <i>F5H</i> gene under the control of the <i>C4H</i> promoter. Elevated expression of the <i>F5H</i> gene in poplar has been previously reported to increase the percent syringyl content of lignin. The wild-type and three transgenic lines were inclined 45° for 3 months to induce tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> formation. Tension and opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> from inclined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s, along with normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> from control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s, were analyzed separately for carbohydrates, lignin, cellulose crystallinity and microfibril angle (MFA). In the wild-type poplar, the lignin in tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> contained a significantly higher percentage of syringyl than normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> or opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>. However, there was no significant difference in the percent syringyl content of the three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> types within each of the transgenic lines. Increasing the <i>F5H</i> gene expression caused an increase in the percent syringyl content and a slight decrease in the total lignin in normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>. In tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>, the addition of a gelatinous layer in the fiber walls resulted in a consistently lower percentage of total lignin in the tissue. Acid-soluble lignin was observed to increase by up to 2.3-fold in the transgenic lines. Compared with normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> and opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>, cell wall crystallinity in tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> was higher and the MFA was smaller, as expected, with no evidence of an effect from modifying the syringyl monomer ratio. Tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> in all the lines contained consistently higher total sugar and glucose percentages when compared with normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> within the respective lines. However, both sugar and glucose percentages were lower in the tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> of transgenic lines when compared with the tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> of wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s. Evaluating the response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s with altered syringyl content to gravity will improve our understanding of the changes in cell wall chemistry and ultrastructural properties of normal, opposite and tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> in plants.</p>

Winter drought impairs xylem phenology, anatomy and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine forests
<p>Continental Mediterranean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s face drought but also cold spells and both climate extremes can impair the resilience capacity of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s. Climate warming could amplify the negative effects of cold spells by inducing premature dehardening. Here we capitalize on a winter drought-induced dieback triggered by a cold spell which occurred in December 2001 affecting Scots pine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s in eastern Spain. We assessed post-dieback recovery by quantifying and comparing radial growth and xylem anatomy of non-declining (ND, crown cover >50%) and declining (D, crown cover ≤50%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s in two sites (VP, Villarroya de los Pinares; TO, Torrijas). We also characterized xylogenesis in both sites and aboveground productivity in site VP. Dieback caused legacy effects since needle loss, a 60% reduction in litter fall and radial-growth decline characterized D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s 3 years after dieback symptoms started appearing in spring 2002. D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s formed collapsed tracheids in the 2002-ring, particularly in the most affected VP site where xylogenesis differences between ND and D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s were most noticeable. The lower growth rates of D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s were caused by a shorter duration of their major xylogenesis phases. In site VP the radial-enlargement and wall-thickening of tracheids were significantly reduced in D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s as compared to ND-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s because these xylogenesis phases tended to start earlier and end later in ND-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s. Gompertz models fitted to tracheid production predicted that maximum growth rates occurred 11–12 days earlier in ND than in D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s. The formation of radially-enlarging tracheids was enhanced by longer days in both study sites and also by wetter conditions in the driest TO site, but xylogenesis sensitivity to climate was reduced in D-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s. Winter-drought dieback impairs xylem anatomy and phenology, aboveground productivity, xylogenesis and growth in Mediterranean Scots pine populations. Affected stands show a costly post-dieback recovery challenging their resilience ability.</p>

Tree Physiology
Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conif</span></strong>erous) because each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> species representing three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> types. We measured whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conif</span></strong>erous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s of the other two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conif</span></strong>ers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to summer soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the water supply of all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining soil moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>.</p>

Tree Physiology
Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to plant growth remains poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C allocation to both reproductive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> rings in fruiting and non-fruiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s for 2 years, as well as in fruits. We isolated the effect of reproduction on C allocation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>y tissues in fruiting and non-fruiting specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-fruiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s, fruiting reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no fruiting, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>y tissues even with fruiting burden. In contrast, fruits had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that fruit production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in fruiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s than non-fruiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s, these results indicate that the C limitation due to fruit burden is minimized by fine-tuning of allocation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, fruiting had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C allocation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Systematic Biology
Diversity, Disparity, and Evolutionary Rate Estimation for Unresolved Yule Trees
<p>The branching structure of biological evolution confers statistical dependencies on phenotypic trait values in related organisms. For this reason, comparative macroevolutionary studies usually begin with an inferred phylogeny that describes the evolutionary relationships of the organisms of interest. The probability of the observed trait data can be computed by assuming a model for trait evolution, such as Brownian motion, over the branches of this fixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>. However, the phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> itself contributes statistical uncertainty to estimates of rates of phenotypic evolution, and many comparative evolutionary biologists regard the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> as a nuisance parameter. In this article, we present a framework for analytically integrating over unknown phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s in comparative evolutionary studies by assuming that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> arises from a continuous-time Markov branching model called the Yule process. To do this, we derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of phylogenetic diversity (PD), which is the sum of branch lengths connecting the species in a clade. We then present a generalization of PD which is equivalent to the expected trait disparity in a set of taxa whose evolutionary relationships are generated by a Yule process and whose traits evolve by Brownian motion. We find expressions for the distribution of expected trait disparity under a Yule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>. Given one or more observations of trait disparity in a clade, we perform fast likelihood-based estimation of the Brownian variance for unresolved clades. Our method does not require simulation or a fixed phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>. We conclude with a brief example illustrating Brownian rate estimation for 12 families in the mammalian order Carnivora, in which the phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> for each family is unresolved.

Root diameter variations explained by anatomy and phylogeny of 50 tropical and temperate tree species
<p>Root diameter, a critical indicator of root physiological function, varies greatly among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> species, but the underlying mechanism of this high variability is unclear. Here, we sampled 50 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> species across tropical and temperate zones in China, and measured root morphological and anatomical traits along the first five branch orders in each species. Our objectives were (i) to reveal the relationships between root diameter, cortical thickness and stele diameter among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> species in tropical and temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s, and (ii) to investigate the relationship of both root morphological and anatomical traits with divergence time during species radiation. The results showed that root diameter was strongly affected by cortical thickness but less by stele diameter in both tropical and temperate species. Changes in cortical thickness explained over 90% of variation in root diameter for the first order, and ∼74–87% for the second and third orders. Thicker roots displayed greater cortical thickness and more cortical cell layers than thinner roots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that root diameter, cortical thickness and number of cortical cell layers significantly correlated with divergence time at the family level, showing similar variation trends in geological time. The results also suggested that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s tend to decrease their root cortical thickness rather than stele diameter during species radiation. The close linkage of variations in root morphology and anatomy to phylogeny as demonstrated by the data from the 50 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> species should provide some insights into the mechanism of root diameter variability among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> species.</p>

Ecophysiological variables influencing Aleppo pine seed and cone production: a review
<p>The most interesting factors associated with seed and cone production of Aleppo pine were largely reviewed to identify broad patterns and potential effectiveness of re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation efforts and planning. Aleppo pine cone production and seed yields are relatively variable, with differences between spatial and temporal influences. These differences are considered, mainly between (i) year, (ii) stand characteristics and (iii) individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> measurements. Annual variability among populations was recorded for cone production per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>, based on influencing factors such as genetic characteristics, wetness, nutrient availability, insect pests and disease. In addition, some factors may affect Aleppo pine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> growth directly but may be affecting seed and cone production indirectly. Therefore, reduced stand density results in less competition among Aleppo pine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s and accompanying understory flora, which subsequently increases the stem diameter and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> dimensions, including seed production. This review suggests that re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation planning, particularly thinning, will result in improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> morphology that will increase Aleppo pine seed and cone crops. Wildfire intensity and stand conditions such as light and soil nutrient status are also examined.</p>

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining variations in bunch number, the number of fruits per bunch and oil dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the number of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ation and bunch ablation affected the bunch number and the fruit number per bunch. Variations in bunch number per month were mainly due to variations in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, variations in fruit number per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong></span></strong>ated plants, the decrease in the number of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and oil concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

A 90,000-year record of Afromontane forest responses to climate change
<p>Pollen records from African highlands are scarce; hence, the paleoecology of the Afromontane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> and its responses to glacial cycles are poorly known.

Pollen data and biome reconstructions show a diverging response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s to climate changes; the upper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> line was extremely unstable, shifting substantially in response to glacial-interglacial climate alternation, whereas the transition between the montane and lowland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s remained remarkably stable.

Here, we report an estimate of global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> extent in dryland biomes, based on analyzing more than 210,000 0.5-hectare sample plots through a photo-interpretation approach using large databases of satellite imagery at (i) very high spatial resolution and (ii) very high temporal resolution, which are available through the Google Earth platform. We show that in 2015, 1327 million hectares of drylands had more than 10% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>-cover, and 1079 million hectares comprised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>.

Plant-soil feedbacks and mycorrhizal type influence temperate forest population dynamics
<p>Feedback with soil biota is an important determinant of terrestrial plant diversity. However, the factors regulating plant-soil feedback, which varies from positive to negative among plant species, remain uncertain. In a large-scale study involving 55 species and 550 populations of North American <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s, the type of mycorrhizal association explained much of the variation in plant-soil feedbacks. In soil collected beneath conspecifics, arbuscular mycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s experienced negative feedback, whereas ectomycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s displayed positive feedback. Additionally, arbuscular mycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s exhibited strong conspecific inhibition at multiple spatial scales, whereas ectomycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s exhibited conspecific facilitation locally and less severe conspecific inhibition regionally. These results suggest that mycorrhizal type, through effects on plant-soil feedbacks, could be an important contributor to population regulation and community structure in temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Cellulose Synthase Stoichiometry in Aspen Differs from Arabidopsis and Norway Spruce
<p>Cellulose is synthesized at the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) containing cellulose synthases (CESAs). Genetic analysis and CESA isoform quantification indicate that cellulose in the secondary cell walls of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is synthesized by isoforms CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8 in equimolar amounts. Here, we used quantitative proteomics to investigate whether the CSC model based on Arabidopsis secondary cell wall CESA stoichiometry can be applied to the angiosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i>) and the gymnosperm <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). In the developing xylem of aspen, the secondary cell wall CESA stoichiometry was 3:2:1 for PtCESA8a/b:PtCESA4:PtCESA7a/b, while in Norway spruce, the stoichiometry was 1:1:1, as observed previously in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, in aspen tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>, the secondary cell wall CESA stoichiometry changed to 8:3:1 for PtCESA8a/b:PtCESA4:PtCESA7a/b. PtCESA8b represented 73% of the total secondary cell wall CESA pool, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of CESA transcripts in cryosectioned tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> revealed increased <i>PtCESA8b</i> expression during the formation of the cellulose-enriched gelatinous layer, while the transcripts of <i>PtCESA4</i>, <i>PtCESA7a/b</i>, and <i>PtCESA8a</i> decreased. A wide-angle x-ray scattering analysis showed that the shift in CESA stoichiometry in tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> coincided with an increase in crystalline cellulose microfibril diameter, suggesting that the CSC CESA composition influences microfibril properties. The aspen CESA stoichiometry results raise the possibility of alternative CSC models and suggest that homomeric PtCESA8b complexes are responsible for cellulose biosynthesis in the gelatinous layer in tension <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>.</p>

First insights into the functional role of vasicentric tracheids and parenchyma in eucalyptus species with solitary vessels: do they contribute to xylem efficiency or safety?
<p>The relationship between hydraulic specific conductivity (<i>k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub>) and vulnerability to cavitation (VC) with size and number of vessels has been studied in many angiosperms. However, few of the studies link other cell types (vasicentric tracheids (VT), fibre–tracheids, parenchyma) with these hydraulic functions. <i>Eucalyptus</i> is one of the most important genera in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ry worldwide. It exhibits a complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> anatomy, with solitary vessels surrounded by VT and parenchyma, which could serve as a good model to investigate the functional role of the different cell types in xylem functioning. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> anatomy (several traits of vessels, VT, fibres and parenchyma) in conjunction with maximum <i>k</i><sub><i>s</i></sub> and VC was studied in adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s of commercial species with medium-to-high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> density (<i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> Labill., <i>Eucalyptus viminalis</i> Labill. and <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh.). Traits of cells accompanying vessels presented correlations with functional variables suggesting that they contribute to both increasing connectivity between adjacent vessels—and, therefore, to xylem conduction efficiency—and decreasing the probability of embolism propagation into the tissue, i.e., xylem safety. All three species presented moderate-to-high resistance to cavitation (mean <i>P</i><sub>50</sub> values = −2.4 to −4.2 MPa) with no general trade-off between efficiency and safety at the interspecific level. The results in these species do not support some well-established hypotheses of the functional meaning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> anatomy.</p>

Photoperiod and temperature responses of bud swelling and bud burst in four temperate forest tree species
<p>Spring phenology of temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s is optimized to maximize the length of the growing season while minimizing the risk of freezing damage. The release from winter dormancy is environmentally mediated by species-specific responses to temperature and photoperiod. We investigated the response of early spring phenology to temperature and photoperiod at different stages of dormancy release in cuttings from four temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> species in controlled environments. By tracking bud development, we were able to identify the onset of bud swelling and bud growth in <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L., <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Mattuschka) Liebl. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. At a given early stage of dormancy release, the onset and duration of the bud swelling prior to bud burst are driven by concurrent temperature and photoperiod, while the maximum growth rate is temperature dependent only, except for <i>Fagus</i>, where long photoperiods also increased bud growth rates. Similarly, the later bud burst was controlled by temperature and photoperiod (in the photoperiod sensitive species <i>Fagus, Quercus</i> and <i>Picea</i>). We conclude that photoperiod is involved in the release of dormancy during the ecodormancy phase and may influence bud burst in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s that have experienced sufficient chilling. This study explored and documented the early bud swelling period that precedes and defines later phenological stages such as canopy greening in conventional phenological works. It is the early bud growth resumption that needs to be understood in order to arrive at a causal interpretation and modelling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> phenology at a large scale. Classic spring phenology events mark visible endpoints of a cascade of processes as evidenced here.</p>

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of carbohydrate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low temperatures on the carbohydrate concentrations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large increases in the sorbitol concentration of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-temperature responses. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling accumulation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol accumulation in xylem sap was always higher from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s with sufficient chilling accumulation than from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s regardless of whether their chilling accumulation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different temperature effects more closely, we compared the carbohydrate concentrations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol concentration in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the temperatures when sufficient chilling accumulated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total carbohydrate concentration of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of accumulated chilling. Instead, as chilling accumulated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that carbohydrates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol accumulation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total carbohydrate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature responses on carbohydrate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

Recovery performance in xylem hydraulic conductivity is correlated with cavitation resistance for temperate deciduous tree species
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>y species hydraulically vulnerable to xylem cavitation may experience daily xylem embolism. How such species cope with the possibility of accumulated embolism is unclear. In this study, we examined seven temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>y species to assess the hypothesis that low cavitation resistance (high vulnerability to cavitation) is compensated by high recovery performance via vessel refilling. We also evaluated leaf functional and xylem structural traits. The xylem recovery index (XRI), defined as the ratio of xylem hydraulic conductivity in plants rewatered after soil drought to that in plants under moist conditions, varied among species. The xylem water potential causing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (Ψ<sub>50</sub>) varied among the species studied, whereas only a slight difference was detected with respect to midday xylem water potential (Ψ<sub>min</sub>), indicating smaller hydraulic safety margins (Ψ<sub>min</sub> − Ψ<sub>50</sub>) for species more vulnerable to cavitation. Cavitation resistance (|Ψ<sub>50</sub>|) was negatively correlated with XRI across species, with cavitation-vulnerable species showing a higher performance in xylem recovery. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> density was positively correlated with cavitation resistance and was negatively correlated with XRI. These novel results reveal that coordination exists between cavitation resistance and xylem recovery performance, in association with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> functional traits such as denser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> for cavitation-resistant xylem and less-dense but water-storable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> for refillable xylem. These findings provide insights into long-term maintenance of water transport in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> species growing under variable environmental conditions.</p>

Resolving Ambiguity of Species Limits and Concatenation in Multilocus Sequence Data for the Construction of Phylogenetic Supermatrices
<p>Public DNA databases are becoming too large and too complex for manual methods to generate phylogenetic supermatrices from multiple gene sequences. Delineating the terminals based on taxonomic labels is no longer practical because species identifications are frequently incomplete and gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s are incongruent with Linnaean binomials, which results in uncertainty about how to combine species units among unlinked loci. We developed a procedure that minimizes the problem of forming multilocus species units in a large phylogenetic data set using algorithms from graph theory. An initial step established sequence clusters for each locus that broadly correspond to the species level. These clusters frequently include sequences labeled with various binomials and specimen identifiers that create multiple alternatives for concatenation. To choose among these possibilities, we minimize taxonomic conflict among the species units globally in the data set using a multipartite heuristic algorithm. The procedure was applied to all available GenBank data for Coleoptera (beetles) including > 10 500 taxon labels and > 23 500 sequences of 4 loci, which were grouped into 11 241 clusters or divergent singletons by the BlastClust software. Within each cluster, unidentified sequences could be assigned to a species name through the association with fully identified sequences, resulting in 510 new identifications (13.9% of total unidentified sequences) of which nearly half were “trans-locus” identifications by clustering of sequences at a secondary locus. The limits of DNA-based clusters were inconsistent with the Linnaean binomials for 1518 clusters (13.5%) that contained more than one binomial or split a single binomial among multiple clusters. By applying a scoring scheme for full and partial name matches in pairs of clusters, a maximum weight set of 7366 global species units was produced. Varying the match weights for partial matches had little effect on the number of units, although if partial matches were disallowed, the number increased greatly. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s from the resulting supermatrices generally produced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> topologies in good agreement with the higher taxonomy of Coleoptera, with fewer terminals compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s generated according to standard filtering of sequences using species labels. The study illustrates a strategy for assembling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>-of-life from an ever more complex primary database.

Classifying drivers of global forest loss
<p>Global maps of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss depict the scale and magnitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent conversion (i.e., de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation) from temporary loss from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ry or wildfire. Using satellite imagery, we developed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27% of global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss can be attributed to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ry (26%), shifting agriculture (24%), and wildfire (23%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation has not declined.

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>y tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>’s structure in combination with dispersed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Monitoring of Freezing Dynamics in Trees: A Simple Phase Shift Causes Complexity
<p>During winter, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s have to cope with harsh conditions, including extreme freeze-thaw stress. This study focused on ice nucleation and propagation, related water shifts and xylem cavitation, as well as cell damage and was based on in situ monitoring of xylem (thermocouples) and surface temperatures (infrared imaging), ultrasonic emissions, and dendrometer analysis. Field experiments during late winter on <i>Picea abies</i> growing at the alpine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">timberlin</span></strong>e revealed three distinct freezing patterns: (1) from the top of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> toward the base, (2) from thin branches toward the main stem’s top and base, and (3) from the base toward the top. Infrared imaging showed freezing within branches from their base toward distal parts. Such complex freezing causes dynamic and heterogenous patterns in water potential and probably in cavitation. This study highlights the interaction between environmental conditions upon freezing and thawing and demonstrates the enormous complexity of freezing processes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s. Diameter shrinkage, which indicated water fluxes within the stem, and acoustic emission analysis, which indicated cavitation events near the ice front upon freezing, were both related to minimum temperature and, upon thawing, related to vapor pressure deficit and soil temperature. These complex patterns, emphasizing the common mechanisms between frost and drought stress, shed new light on winter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> physiology.</p>

Ultrafast Approximation for Phylogenetic Bootstrap
<p>Nonparametric bootstrap has been a widely used tool in phylogenetic analysis to assess the clade support of phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s. However, with the rapidly growing amount of data, this task remains a computational bottleneck. Recently, approximation methods such as the RAxML rapid bootstrap (RBS) and the Shimodaira–Hasegawa-like approximate likelihood ratio test have been introduced to speed up the bootstrap. Here, we suggest an ultrafast bootstrap approximation approach (UFBoot) to compute the support of phylogenetic groups in maximum likelihood (ML) based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s. To achieve this, we combine the resampling estimated log-likelihood method with a simple but effective collection scheme of candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s. We also propose a stopping rule that assesses the convergence of branch support values to automatically determine when to stop collecting candidate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s. UFBoot achieves a median speed up of 3.1 (range: 0.66–33.3) to 10.2 (range: 1.32–41.4) compared with RAxML RBS for real DNA and amino acid alignments, respectively. Moreover, our extensive simulations show that UFBoot is robust against moderate model violations and the support values obtained appear to be relatively unbiased compared with the conservative standard bootstrap. This provides a more direct interpretation of the bootstrap support. We offer an efficient and easy-to-use software (available at <ext-link>http://www.cibiv.at/software/iq<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong></ext-link>) to perform the UFBoot analysis with ML <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> inference.</p>

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

Interplay of growth rate and xylem plasticity for optimal coordination of carbon and hydraulic economies in <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> trees
<p>Efficient leaf water supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> growth. Renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing carbon investment while growing taller, and any deficiency of carbon availability may result in increasing hydraulic constraints to water flow. Therefore, plants need to coordinate carbon assimilation and biomass allocation to guarantee an efficient and safe long-distance transport system. We tested the hypothesis that reduced branch elongation rates together with carbon-saving adjustments of xylem anatomy hydraulically compensate for the reduction in biomass allocation to xylem. We measured leaf biomass, hydraulic and anatomical properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing (SG) and 10 fast growing (FG) <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> L. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s. Branches of SG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s had five times slower branch elongation rate (7 vs 35  cm year<sup>–1</sup>), and produced a higher leaf biomass (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). On the contrary, we found no differences between SG and FG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s in terms of leaf-specific conductivity (<i>P</i> > 0.05) and xylem safety (Ψ<sub>50</sub> ≈ −3.2  MPa). Slower elongation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of carbon costs associated with growth, while maintaining similar leaf-specific conductivity and xylem safety.</p>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history transitions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological transitions essential to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the transition from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy transition—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s.</p>

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrochronolog</span></strong>ical methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cotton<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, genetics and ecology. Here we address how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>y perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>y perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the availability of genetic and genomic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>y perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Statistical Inference of Allopolyploid Species Networks in the Presence of Incomplete Lineage Sorting
<p>Polyploidy is an important speciation mechanism, particularly in land plants. Allopolyploid species are formed after hybridization between otherwise intersterile parental species. Recent theoretical progress has led to successful implementation of species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> models that take population genetic parameters into account. However, these models have not included allopolyploid hybridization and the special problems imposed when species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s of allopolyploids are inferred. Here, 2 new models for the statistical inference of the evolutionary history of allopolyploids are evaluated using simulations and demonstrated on 2 empirical data sets. It is assumed that there has been a single hybridization event between 2 diploid species resulting in a genomic allotetraploid. The evolutionary history can be represented as a species network or as a multilabeled species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>, in which some pairs of tips are labeled with the same species. In one of the models (AlloppMUL), the multilabeled species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> is inferred directly. This is the simplest model and the most widely applicable, since fewer assumptions are made. The second model (AlloppNET) incorporates the hybridization event explicitly which means that fewer parameters need to be estimated. Both models are implemented in the BEAST framework. Simulations show that both models are useful and that AlloppNET is more accurate if the assumptions it is based on are valid. The models are demonstrated on previously analyzed data from the genera <i>Pachycladon</i> (Brassicaceae) and <i>Silene</i> (Caryophyllaceae).

Herbivores as drivers of negative density dependence in tropical forest saplings
<p>Ecological theory predicts that the high local diversity observed in tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s is maintained by negative density–dependent interactions within and between closely related plant species. By using long-term data on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> growth and survival for coexisting <i>Inga</i> (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae) congeners, we tested two mechanisms thought to underlie negative density dependence (NDD): competition for resources and attack by herbivores. We quantified the similarity of neighbors in terms of key ecological traits that mediate these interactions, as well as the similarity of herbivore communities. We show that phytochemical similarity and shared herbivore communities are associated with decreased growth and survival at the sapling stage, a key bottleneck in the life cycle of tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s. None of the traits associated with resource acquisition affect plant performance, indicating that competition between neighbors may not shape local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> diversity. These results suggest that herbivore pressure is the primary mechanism driving NDD at the sapling stage.</p>

Tropical forests are a net carbon source based on aboveground measurements of gain and loss
<p>The carbon balance of tropical ecosystems remains uncertain, with top-down atmospheric studies suggesting an overall sink and bottom-up ecological approaches indicating a modest net source. Here we use 12 years (2003 to 2014) of MODIS pantropical satellite data to quantify net annual changes in the aboveground carbon density of tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>y live <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation, providing direct, measurement-based evidence that the world’s tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s are a net carbon source of 425.2<bold> </bold>± 92.0 teragrams of carbon per year (Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). This net release of carbon consists of losses of 861.7 ± 80.2 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup> and gains of 436.5 ± 31.0 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>. Gains result from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> growth; losses result from de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation and from reductions in carbon density within standing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s (degradation or disturbance), with the latter accounting for 68.9% of overall losses.</p>

Cash for carbon: A randomized trial of payments for ecosystem services to reduce deforestation

MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 Enhance Drought Tolerance by Modulating Root Vessels and Cell Walls in Apple
<p>Water deficit is one of the main limiting factors in apple (<i>Malus</i> × <i>domestica</i> Borkh.) cultivation. Root architecture plays an important role in the drought tolerance of plants; however, research efforts to improve drought tolerance of apple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s have focused on aboveground targets. Due to the difficulties associated with visualization and data analysis, there is currently a poor understanding of the genetic players and molecular mechanisms involved in the root architecture of apple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s under drought conditions. We previously observed that MdMYB88 and its paralog MdMYB124 regulate apple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> root morphology. In this study, we found that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 play important roles in maintaining root hydraulic conductivity under long-term drought conditions and therefore contribute toward adaptive drought tolerance. Further investigation revealed that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 regulate root xylem development by directly binding <i>MdVND6</i> and <i>MdMYB46</i> promoters and thus influence expression of their target genes under drought conditions. In addition, MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 were shown to regulate the deposition of cellulose and lignin root cell walls in response to drought. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the importance of MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 in root architecture, root xylem development, and secondary cell wall deposition in response to drought in apple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s.</p>

Multi-Omics Driven Assembly and Annotation of the Sandalwood (<i>Santalum album</i>) Genome
<p>Indian sandal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> (<i>Santalum album</i>) is an important tropical evergreen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> known for its fragrant heart<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>-derived essential oil and its valuable carving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>. Here, we applied an integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approach to assemble and annotate the Indian sandal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> genome. Our genome sequencing resulted in the establishment of a draft map of the smallest genome for any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>y <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> species to date (221 Mb). The genome annotation predicted 38,119 protein-coding genes and 27.42% repetitive DNA elements. In-depth proteome analysis revealed the identities of 72,325 unique peptides, which confirmed 10,076 of the predicted genes. The addition of transcriptomic and proteogenomic approaches resulted in the identification of 53 novel proteins and 34 gene-correction events that were missed by genomic approaches. Proteogenomic analysis also helped in reassigning 1,348 potential noncoding RNAs as bona fide protein-coding messenger RNAs. Gene expression patterns at the RNA and protein levels indicated that peptide sequencing was useful in capturing proteins encoded by nuclear and organellar genomes alike. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic evidence provided an unbiased approach toward the identification of proteins encoded by organellar genomes. Such proteins are often missed in transcriptome data sets due to the enrichment of only messenger RNAs that contain poly(A) tails. Overall, the use of integrated omic approaches enhanced the quality of the assembly and annotation of this nonmodel plant genome. The availability of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data will enhance genomics-assisted breeding, germplasm characterization, and conservation of sandal<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s.</p>

Gene Regulatory Networks for the Haploid-to-Diploid Transition of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>The sexual cycle of the unicellular <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> culminates in the formation of diploid zygotes that differentiate into dormant spores that eventually undergo meiosis. Mating between gametes induces rapid cell wall shedding via the enzyme g-lysin; cell fusion is followed by heterodimerization of sex-specific homeobox transcription factors, GSM1 and GSP1, and initiation of zygote-specific gene expression. To investigate the genetic underpinnings of the zygote developmental pathway, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis of both pre- and post-fertilization samples. We identified 253 transcripts specifically enriched in early zygotes, 82% of which were not up-regulated in <i>gsp1</i> null zygotes. We also found that the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer negatively regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative wall program at the posttranscriptional level, enabling prompt transition from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative wall to zygotic wall assembly. Annotation of the g-lysin-induced and early zygote genes reveals distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative and zygotic wall programs, supported by concerted up-regulation of genes encoding cell wall-modifying enzymes and proteins involved in nucleotide-sugar metabolism. The haploid-to-diploid transition in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> is masterfully controlled by the GSM1/GSP1 heterodimer, translating fertilization and gamete coalescence into a bona fide differentiation program. The fertilization-triggered integration of genes required to make related, but structurally and functionally distinct organelles—the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative versus zygote cell wall—presents a likely scenario for the evolution of complex developmental gene regulatory networks.</p>

SDG2-Mediated H3K4me3 Is Crucial for Chromatin Condensation and Mitotic Division during Male Gametogenesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Epigenetic reprogramming occurring during reproduction is crucial for both animal and plant development. Histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic mark of transcriptional active euchromatin. While much has been learned in somatic cells, H3K4me3 deposition and function in gametophyte is poorly studied. Here, we demonstrate that SET DOMAIN GROUP2 (SDG2)-mediated H3K4me3 deposition participates in epigenetic reprogramming during Arabidopsis male gametogenesis. We show that loss of SDG2 barely affects meiosis and cell fate establishment of haploid cells. However, we found that SDG2 is critical for postmeiotic microspore development. Mitotic cell division progression is partly impaired in the loss-of-function <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant, particularly at the second mitosis setting up the two sperm cells. We demonstrate that SDG2 is involved in promoting chromatin decondensation in the pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative nucleus, likely through its role in H3K4me3 deposition, which prevents ectopic heterochromatic H3K9me2 speckle formation. Moreover, we found that derepression of the LTR retrotransposon <i>ATLANTYS1</i> is compromised in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell of the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant pollen. Consistent with chromatin condensation and compromised transcription activity, pollen germination and pollen tube elongation, representing the key function of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell in transporting sperm cells during fertilization, are inhibited in the <i>sdg2-1</i> mutant. Taken together, we conclude that SDG2-mediated H3K4me3 is an essential epigenetic mark of the gametophyte chromatin landscape, playing critical roles in gamete mitotic cell cycle progression and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative cell function during male gametogenesis and beyond.</p>

Regulation of Vegetative Phase Change by SWI2/SNF2 Chromatin Remodeling ATPase BRAHMA
<p>Plants progress from a juvenile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase of development to an adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase of development before they enter the reproductive phase. miR156 has been shown to be the master regulator of the juvenile-to-adult transition in plants. However, the mechanism of how miR156 is transcriptionally regulated still remains elusive. In a forward genetic screen, we identified that a mutation in the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) exhibited an accelerated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase change phenotype by reducing the expression of miR156, which in turn caused a corresponding increase in the levels of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> genes. BRM regulates miR156 expression by directly binding to the <i>MIR156A</i> promoter. Mutations in <i>BRM</i> not only increased occupancy of the −2 and +1 nucleosomes proximal to the transcription start site at the <i>MIR156A</i> locus but also the levels of trimethylated histone H3 at Lys 27. The precocious phenotype of <i>brm</i> mutant was partially suppressed by a second mutation in <i>SWINGER</i> (<i>SWN</i>), but not by a mutation in <i>CURLEY LEAF</i>, both of which are key components of the Polycomb Group Repressive Complex 2 in plants. Our results indicate that BRM and SWN act antagonistically at the nucleosome level to fine-tune the temporal expression of miR156 to regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ative phase change in Arabidopsis.</p>

Gene Tree Discordance Can Generate Patterns of Diminishing Convergence over Time
<p>Phenotypic convergence is an exciting outcome of adaptive evolution, occurring when different species find similar solutions to the same problem. Unraveling the molecular basis of convergence provides a way to link genotype to adaptive phenotypes, but can also shed light on the extent to which molecular evolution is repeatable and predictable. Many recent genome-wide studies have uncovered a striking pattern of diminishing convergence over time, ascribing this pattern to the presence of intramolecular epistatic interactions. Here, we consider gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> discordance as an alternative cause of changes in convergence levels over time in a primate dataset. We demonstrate that gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> discordance can produce patterns of diminishing convergence by itself, and that controlling for discordance as a cause of apparent convergence makes the pattern disappear. We also show that synonymous substitutions, where neither selection nor epistasis should be prevalent, have the same diminishing pattern of molecular convergence in primates. Finally, we demonstrate that even in situations where biological discordance is not possible, discordance due to errors in species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> inference can drive similar patterns. Though intramolecular epistasis could in principle create a pattern of declining convergence over time, our results suggest a possible alternative explanation for this widespread pattern. These results contribute to a growing appreciation not just of the presence of gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> discordance, but of the unpredictable effects this discordance can have on analyses of molecular evolution.</p>

Comparative Genomics of the Pine Pathogens and Beetle Symbionts in the Genus <i>Grosmannia</i>
<p>Studies on beetle/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> fungal symbionts typically characterize the ecological and geographic distributions of the fungal populations. There is limited understanding of the genome-wide evolutionary processes that act within and between species as such fungi adapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess genomic evidence for such evolutionary processes by extending our recent work on <i>Grosmannia clavigera</i>, which is vectored by the mountain pine beetle and jeffrey pine beetle. We report the genome sequences of an additional 11 <i>G. clavigera</i> (Gc) sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species, <i>Grosmannia</i> sp. (Gs) and Gc. The 12 fungal genomes are structurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between species. We identified 103,430 single-nucleotide variations that separated the <i>Grosmannia</i> strains into divergent Gs and Gc clades, and further divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which may represent an additional species. Comparing variable genes between these lineages, we identified truncated genes and potential pseudogenes, as well as seven genes that show evidence of positive selection. As these variable genes are involved in secondary metabolism and in detoxifying or utilizing host-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> defense chemicals (e.g., polyketide synthases, oxidoreductases, and mono-oxygenases), their variants may reflect adaptation to the specific chemistries of the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s <i>Pinus contorta</i>, <i>P. ponderosa</i>, and <i>P. jeffreyi</i>. This work provides a comprehensive resource for developing informative markers for landscape population genomics of these ecologically and economically important fungi, and an approach that could be extended to other beetle–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>-associated fungi.</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from <ext-link>www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>.</p>

Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ values ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ measurement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to measure air samples from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with samples from 36 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of measuring ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sensors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> measurement proved to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar measurements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field samples (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable sensors measurement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the sensors’ methods enable accurate ARQ measurements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation
<p>Wind and solar farms offer a major pathway to clean, renewable energies.

In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation to show that large-scale installations of wind and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold precipitation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface friction and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation further enhances precipitation, creating a positive albedo–precipitation–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">veget</span></strong>ation feedback that contributes ~80% of the precipitation increase for wind farms.

Plant diversity increases with the strength of negative density dependence at the global scale
<p>Theory predicts that higher biodiversity in the tropics is maintained by specialized interactions among plants and their natural enemies that result in conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD). By using more than 3000 species and nearly 2.4 million <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong>s across 24 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> plots worldwide, we show that global patterns in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tree</span></strong> species diversity reflect not only stronger CNDD at tropical versus temperate latitudes but also a latitudinal shift in the relationship between CNDD and species abundance. CNDD was stronger for rare species at tropical versus temperate latitudes, potentially causing the persistence of greater numbers of rare species in the tropics. Our study reveals fundamental differences in the nature of local-scale biotic interactions that contribute to the maintenance of species diversity across temperate and tropical communities.</p>

Clustering of canopy traits yielded a map of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> beta functional diversity for land-use analysis. Up to 53% of each mapped, functionally distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> presents an opportunity for new conservation action. Mapping functional diversity advances our understanding of the biosphere to conserve more biodiversity in the face of land use and climate change.</p>

Positive biodiversity-productivity relationship predominant in global forests
<p>The biodiversity-productivity relationship (BPR) is foundational to our understanding of the global extinction crisis and its impacts on ecosystem functioning. Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and effective conservation of biodiversity. Using ground-sourced data from 777,126 permanent plots, spanning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> productivity worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> productivity alone—US$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our estimation—is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global conservation. This highlights the need for a worldwide reassessment of biodiversity values, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> management strategies, and conservation priorities.</p>

Plant diversity patterns in neotropical dry forests and their conservation implications
<p>Seasonally dry tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s are distributed across Latin America and the Caribbean and are highly threatened, with less than 10% of their original extent remaining in many countries. Using 835 inventories covering 4660 species of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wood</span></strong>y plants, we show marked floristic turnover among inventories and regions, which may be higher than in other neotropical biomes, such as savanna. Such high floristic turnover indicates that numerous conservation areas across many countries will be needed to protect the full diversity of tropical dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s. Our results provide a scientific framework within which national decision-makers can contextualize the floristic significance of their dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> at a regional and continental scale.</p>

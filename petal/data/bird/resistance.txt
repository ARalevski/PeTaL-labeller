Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic efficiency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and water use efficiencies. To improve water use efficiency, mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance, water use efficiency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance among cultivars apparently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">imped</span></strong>es positive scaling between mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance and water use efficiency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing water use efficiency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izing selection on stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance.</p>

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>able, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>able, with the pressure inducing 50% loss of stem hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% loss of hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (change in percentage loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability segmentation provides significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ion of the perennial stem.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing). We show that the frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high bandwidths, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low bandwidths, notably, increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing leads to better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz bandwidth. These results open the door to high-performance ultra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity.</p>

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The influence of the dynamics of leaf hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) diurnally and during dehydration on stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance and photosynthesis remains unclear. Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during dehydration; (2) its basis in the hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem pathways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its dynamics on irradiance; (4) its impact on diurnal patterns of stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas exchange and survival under simulated drought regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability to dehydration diurnally in both gas exchange and hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to dehydration. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher irradiance in well-hydrated leaves across the full range of water potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability was observed. Modeling indicated that responses to dehydration and irradiance are likely attributable to changes in membrane permeability and that a dynamic <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> would contribute strongly to stomatal closure, improving performance, survival, and efficient water use during drought. These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in hydraulic traits and their influence on gas exchange during dehydration.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion from actin-mediated transport and measured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth. This model predicts that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Genetic and phenotypically flexible components of seasonal variation in immune function
<p>Animals cope with seasonal variation in environmental factors by adjustments of physiology and life history. When seasonal variation is partly predictable, such adjustments can be based on a genetic component or be phenotypically flexible. Animals have to allocate limited resources over different demands, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e function. Accordingly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e traits could change seasonally, and such changes could have a genetic component that differs between environments. We tested this hypothesis in genotypically distinct groups of a widespread songbird, the stonechat (<i>Saxicola torquata</i>). We compared variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity during 1 year in long-distance migrants, short-distance migrants, tropical residents and hybrids in a common garden environment. Additionally, we investigated phenotypically flexible responses to temperature by applying different temperature regimes to one group. We assessed constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity by measuring hemagglutination, hemolysis, haptoglobin and bactericidal ability against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. Genotypic groups differed in patterns of variation of all measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e indices except haptoglobin. Hybrids differed from, but were rarely intermediate to, parental subspecies. Temperature treatment only influenced patterns of hemolysis and bactericidal ability against <i>E. coli.</i> We conclude that seasonal variation in constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity has a genetic component, that heredity does not follow simple Mendelian rules, and that some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e measures are relatively rigid while others are more flexible. Furthermore, our results support the idea that seasonal variability in constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity is associated with variability in environment and annual-cycle demands. This study stresses the importance of considering seasonal variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e function in relation to the ecology and life history of the organism of interest.</p>

Immunity as a continuum of archetypes
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system has long been recognized for its importance in eliminating pathogens. Recently, it has become appreciated for additional distinct roles in normal tissue biology, contributing to tissue development and maintenance. Further, it is being revealed as a major force in diseases as diverse as fibrosis, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cancer. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system is exquisitely selective; more than a billion different adaptive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) survey the body. These can individually be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ized to antigens—for example, by vaccination—leading to their expansion and to a rapid and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response that destroys antigen-bearing cells upon reexposure. Alternatively, the system can become “tolerant” when antigen-specific T cells and/or B cells are deleted or inactivated. Historically, activation versus inaction (tolerance) have dominated views of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system. These, however, should be considered the extremes of a continuum of “archetypal” response states that collections of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells can take, many of which serve to accommodate dynamic tissue function.</p>

Analysis of the ZAR1 Immune Complex Reveals Determinants for Immunity and Molecular Interactions<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants depend on innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong> disease. Plant pathogenic bacteria, like <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>, use the type III secretion system as a molecular syringe to inject type III secreted effector (T3SE) proteins in plants. The primary function of most T3SEs is to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity; however, the plant can evolve nucleotide-binding domain-leucine-rich repeat domain-containing proteins to recognize specific T3SEs. The AtZAR1 NLR induces strong defense responses against <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>X. campestris</i>. The <i>P. syringae</i> T3SE HopZ1a is an acetyltransferase that acetylates the pseudokinase AtZED1 and triggers recognition by AtZAR1. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that lead to AtZAR1-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in response to HopZ1a. We established a transient expression system in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> to study detailed interactions among HopZ1a, AtZED1, and AtZAR1. We show that the AtZAR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e pathway is conserved in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and identify AtZAR1 domains, and residues in AtZAR1 and AtZED1, that are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and protein-protein interactions in planta and in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>). We show that the coiled-coil domain of AtZAR1 oligomerizes, and this domain acts as a signal to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. This detailed analysis of the AtZAR1-AtZED1 protein complex provides a better understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling hub controlled by AtZAR1.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>e light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

A Subset of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes Is Essential for Plant Immunity
<p>Of the three classes of enzymes involved in ubiquitination, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) have been often incorrectly considered to play merely an auxiliary role in the process, and few E2 enzymes have been investigated in plants. To reveal the role of E2 in plant innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, we identified and cloned 40 tomato genes encoding ubiquitin E2 proteins. Thioester assays indicated that the majority of the genes encode enzymatically active E2. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 40 tomato E2 enzymes into 13 groups, of which members of group III were found to interact and act specifically with AvrPtoB, a <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> effector that uses its ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity to suppress host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Knocking down the expression of group III E2 genes in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> diminished the AvrPtoB-promoted degradation of the Fen kinase and the AvrPtoB suppression of host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity-associated programmed cell death. Importantly, silencing group III E2 genes also resulted in reduced pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (PTI). By contrast, programmed cell death induced by several effector-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity elicitors was not affected on group III-silenced plants. Functional characterization suggested redundancy among group III members for their role in the suppression of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity by AvrPtoB and in PTI and identified UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING11 (UBC11), UBC28, UBC29, UBC39, and UBC40 as playing a more significant role in PTI than other group III members. Our work builds a foundation for the further characterization of E2s in plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and reveals that AvrPtoB has evolved a strategy for suppressing host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity that is difficult for the plant to thwart.</p>

One PAH antigen linked to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured monocytes and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and lung studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control lungs. Elevated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control lungs (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were elevated in PAH versus control lungs (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating monocytes, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an interleukin 6-independent manner. Furthermore, 3 weekly injections of HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced hemodynamic and vascular changes of pulmonary hypertension in rats (n=8) and elevated interleukin 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study reveals that upregulation of the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K could both initiate and sustain activation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system and cause vascular changes associated with PAH.</p></sec>

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statins are effective in the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline expands recommended statin use, but its cost-effectiveness has not been compared with other guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the ACC/AHA guideline relative to current use, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and universal statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age over a 10-year horizon from 2016 to 2025. Sensitivity analyses varied costs, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and numbers needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net cost savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than women. Results vary moderately with different risk thresholds for instituting statins and statin toxicity estimates but depend greatly on the disutility caused by daily medication use (pill burden).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>At a population level, the ACC/AHA guideline for expanded statin use for primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion is projected to treat more people, to save more lives, and to cost less compared with Adult Treatment Panel III in both men and women. Whether individuals benefit from long-term statin use for primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>ion depends more on the disutility associated with pill burden than their degree of cardiovascular risk.</p></sec>

miR-183 cluster scales mechanical pain sensitivity by regulating basal and neuropathic pain genes
<p>Nociception is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prevent</span></strong>s tissue damage but can also facilitate chronic pain. Whether a general principle governs these two types of pain is unknown. Here, we show that both basal mechanical and neuropathic pain are controlled by the microRNA-183 (miR-183) cluster in mice. This single cluster controls more than 80% of neuropathic pain–regulated genes and scales basal mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and mechanical allodynia by regulating auxiliary voltage-gated calcium channel subunits α2δ-1 and α2δ-2. Basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity is controlled in nociceptors, and allodynia involves TrkB<sup>+</sup> light-touch mechanoreceptors. These light-touch–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive neurons, which normally do not elicit pain, produce pain during neuropathy that is reversed by gabapentin. Thus, a single microRNA cluster continuously scales acute noxious mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity in nociceptive neurons and suppresses neuropathic pain transduction in a specific, light-touch–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive neuronal type recruited during mechanical allodynia.</p>

BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 Associates with Immune Receptors and Is Required for Immune Responses
<p>Plants utilize cell surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMP/DAMPs) and initiate pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (PTI). Here, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 (BSK5), a member of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily XII, in PRR-initiated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. BSK5 localized to the plant cell periphery, interacted in yeast and in planta with multiple receptor-like kinases, including the ELONGATION FACTOR-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and PEP1 RECEPTOR1 (PEPR1) PRRs, and was phosphorylated in vitro by PEPR1 and EFR in the kinase activation loop. Consistent with a role in PTI, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants displayed enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and to the fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Furthermore, <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants were impaired in several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses induced by the elf18, pep1, and flg22 PAMP/DAMPs, including resistance to <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>B. cinerea</i>, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition at the cell wall, and enhanced <i>PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1</i> gene expression. However, <i>bsk5</i> plants were not affected in PAMP/DAMP activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and expression of the <i>FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> or the WRKY domain-containing gene <i>WRKY29</i>. BSK5 variants mutated in the BSK5 myristoylation site, ATP-binding site, and kinase activation loop failed to complement defective PTI phenotypes of <i>bsk5</i> mutant plants, suggesting that localization to the cell periphery, kinase activity, and phosphorylation by PRRs are critical for the function of BSK5 in PTI. These findings demonstrate that BSK5 plays a role in PTI by interacting with multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e receptors.</p>

Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (γ) of xylem sap plays a key role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izing air-water interfaces at the pits between water- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low water potentials. We studied seasonal changes in xylem sap γ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine timberline. We analyzed their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability to drought-induced embolism using solutions of different γ and estimated the potential effect of seasonal changes in γ on hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability. In both species, xylem sap γ showed distinct seasonal courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. Solutions with low γ caused higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability to drought-induced xylem embolism. The water potential at 50% loss of hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was −3.35 and −3.86 MPa at γ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup> but −2.11 and −2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa seasonal variation in 50% loss of hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity. The results revealed pronounced effects of changes in xylem sap γ on the hydraulic safety of trees in situ. These effects also are relevant in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability analyses, where the use of standard solutions with high γ overestimates hydraulic safety. Thus, γ should be considered carefully in hydraulic studies.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf hydraulic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During drought-induced dehydration, the leaf hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant water transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild water stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf water transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong> the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of water transport under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant water transport during progressive drought.</p>

SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 Aides in Resilience to Salt and Drought in Freezing-Sensitive Tomato
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>IVE TO FREEZING2 (SFR2) is crucial for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ing chloroplast membranes following freezing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). It has been shown that SFR2 homologs are present in all land plants, including freezing-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive species, raising the question of SFR2 function beyond freezing tolerance. Similar to freezing, salt and drought can cause dehydration. Thus, it is hypothesized that in freezing-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive plants SFR2 may play roles in their resilience to salt or drought. To test this hypothesis, <i>SlSFR2</i> RNAi lines were generated in the cold/freezing-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive species tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> [M82 <i>cv</i>]). Hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity to salt and drought of <i>SlSFR2</i>-RNAi lines was observed. Higher tolerance of wild-type tomatoes was correlated with the production of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol, a product of SFR2 activity. Tomato SFR2 in vitro activity is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and its optimal pH is 7.5, similar to that of Arabidopsis SFR2, but the specific activity of tomato SFR2 in vitro is almost double that of Arabidopsis SFR2. When salt and drought stress were applied to Arabidopsis, no conditions could be identified at which SFR2 was induced prior to irreversibly impacting plant growth, suggesting that SFR2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>s Arabidopsis primarily against freezing. Discovery of tomato SFR2 function in drought and salt resilience provides further insights into general membrane lipid remodeling-based stress tolerance mechanisms and together with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ion against freezing in freezing-resistant plants such as Arabidopsis, it adds lipid remodeling as a possible target for the engineering of abiotic stress-resilient crops.</p>

Immunogene and viral transcript dynamics during parasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite infection of developing honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) pupae
<p>The ectoparasitic <i>Varroa destructor</i> mite is a major contributor to the ongoing honey bee health crisis. <i>Varroa</i> interacts with honey bee viruses, exacerbating their pathogenicity. In addition to vectoring viruses, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression of the developing honey bee hosts by <i>Varroa</i> has been proposed to explain the synergy between viruses and mites. However, the evidence for honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e suppression by <i>V. destructor</i> is contentious. We systematically studied the quantitative effects of experimentally introduced <i>V. destructor</i> mites on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e gene expression at five specific time points during the development of the honey bee hosts. Mites reproduced normally and were associated with increased titers of deformed wing virus in the developing bees. Our data on different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes show little evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression of honey bees by <i>V. destructor</i>. Experimental wounding of developing bees increases relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e gene expression and deformed wing virus titers. Combined, these results suggest that mite feeding activity itself and not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>osuppression may contribute to the synergy between viruses and mites. However, our results also suggest that increased expression of honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes decreases mite reproductive success, which may be explored to enhance mite control strategies. Finally, our expression data for multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes across developmental time and different experimental treatments indicates co-regulation of several of these genes and thus improves our understanding of the understudied honey bee <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e system.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Functional analysis of a zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant identifies key transcriptional components of the innate immune system
<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an important class of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize microbial and danger signals. Their downstream signaling upon ligand binding is vital for initiation of the innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response. In human and mammalian models, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) is known for its central role as an adaptor molecule in interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) and TLR signaling. The zebrafish is increasingly used as a complementary model system for disease research and drug screening. Here, we describe a zebrafish line with a truncated version of MyD88 as the first zebrafish mutant for a TLR signaling component. We show that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e-compromised mutant has a lower survival rate under standard rearing conditions and is more susceptible to challenge with the acute bacterial pathogens <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. Microarray and quantitative PCR analysis revealed that expression of genes for transcription factors central to innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (including NF-ĸB and AP-1) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b, is dependent on MyD88 signaling during these bacterial infections. Nevertheless, expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e genes independent of MyD88 in the <i>myd88</i> mutant line was sufficient to limit growth of an attenuated <i>S. typhimurium</i> strain. In the case of infection with the chronic bacterial pathogen <i>Mycobacterium marinum</i>, we show that MyD88 signaling has an important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ive role during early pathogenesis. During mycobacterial infection, the <i>myd88</i> mutant shows accelerated formation of granuloma-like aggregates and increased bacterial burden, with associated lower induction of genes central to innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. This zebrafish <i>myd88</i> mutant will be a valuable tool for further study of the role of IL1R and TLR signaling in the innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity processes underlying infectious diseases, inflammatory disorders and cancer.</p>

Recovery performance in xylem hydraulic conductivity is correlated with cavitation resistance for temperate deciduous tree species
<p>Woody species hydraulically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>able to xylem cavitation may experience daily xylem embolism. How such species cope with the possibility of accumulated embolism is unclear. In this study, we examined seven temperate woody species to assess the hypothesis that low cavitation resistance (high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability to cavitation) is compensated by high recovery performance via vessel refilling. We also evaluated leaf functional and xylem structural traits. The xylem recovery index (XRI), defined as the ratio of xylem hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity in plants rewatered after soil drought to that in plants under moist conditions, varied among species. The xylem water potential causing 50% loss of hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity (Ψ<sub>50</sub>) varied among the species studied, whereas only a slight difference was detected with respect to midday xylem water potential (Ψ<sub>min</sub>), indicating smaller hydraulic safety margins (Ψ<sub>min</sub> − Ψ<sub>50</sub>) for species more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>able to cavitation. Cavitation resistance (|Ψ<sub>50</sub>|) was negatively correlated with XRI across species, with cavitation-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>able species showing a higher performance in xylem recovery. Wood density was positively correlated with cavitation resistance and was negatively correlated with XRI. These novel results reveal that coordination exists between cavitation resistance and xylem recovery performance, in association with wood functional traits such as denser wood for cavitation-resistant xylem and less-dense but water-storable wood for refillable xylem. These findings provide insights into long-term maintenance of water transport in tree species growing under variable environmental conditions.</p>

The uncertain future of protected lands and waters
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ed areas are intended to safeguard biodiversity in perpetuity, yet evidence suggests that widespread legal changes undermine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ed area durability and efficacy. We documented these legal changes—<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ed area downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD) events—in the United States and Amazonian countries and compiled available data globally. Governments of the United States and Amazonian countries enacted 269 and 440 PADDD events, respectively. Between 1892 and 2018, 73 countries enacted 3749 PADDD events, removing 519,857 square kilometers from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ion and tempering regulations in an additional 1,659,972 square kilometers; 78% of events were enacted since 2000.

Sensitivity to “sunk costs” in mice, rats, and humans
<p>Sunk costs are irrecoverable investments that should not influence decisions, because decisions should be made on the basis of expected future consequences. Both human and nonhuman animals can show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity to sunk costs, but reports from across species are inconsistent. In a temporal context, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity to sunk costs arises when an individual resists ending an activity, even if it seems unproductive, because of the time already invested. In two parallel foraging tasks that we designed, we found that mice, rats, and humans show similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivities to sunk costs in their decision-making. Unexpectedly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity to time invested accrued only after an initial decision had been made. These findings suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity to temporal sunk costs lies in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability distinct from deliberation processes and that this distinction is present across species.</p>

One-third of global protected land is under intense human pressure
<p>In an era of massive biodiversity loss, the greatest conservation success story has been the growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ed land globally. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ed areas are the primary defense against biodiversity loss, but extensive human activity within their boundaries can undermine this. Using the most comprehensive global map of human pressure, we show that 6 million square kilometers (32.8%) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ed land is under intense human pressure. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ed areas designated before the Convention on Biological Diversity was ratified in 1992, 55% have since experienced human pressure increases. These increases were lowest in large, strict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ed areas, showing that they are potentially effective, at least in some nations. Transparent reporting on human pressure within <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ed areas is now critical, as are global targets aimed at efforts required to halt biodiversity loss.</p>

Incomplete host immunity favors the evolution of virulence in an emergent pathogen
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e memory evolved to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong> hosts from reinfection, but incomplete responses that allow future reinfection may inadvertently select for more-harmful pathogens. We present empirical and modeling evidence that incomplete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity promotes the evolution of higher virulence in a natural host-pathogen system. We performed sequential infections of house finches with <i>Mycoplasma gallisepticum</i> strains of various levels of virulence. Virulent bacterial strains generated stronger host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ion against reinfection than less virulent strains and thus excluded less virulent strains from infecting previously exposed hosts. In a two-strain model, the resulting fitness advantage selected for an almost twofold increase in pathogen virulence. Thus, the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e systems that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong> hosts from infection can concomitantly drive the evolution of more-harmful pathogens in nature.</p>

Genome-wide identification of interferon-sensitive mutations enables influenza vaccine design
<p>In conventional attenuated viral vaccines, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ogenicity is often suboptimal. Here we present a systematic approach for vaccine development that eliminates interferon (IFN)–modulating functions genome-wide while maintaining virus replication fitness. We applied a quantitative high-throughput genomics system to influenza A virus that simultaneously measured the replication fitness and IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of mutations across the entire genome. By incorporating eight IFN-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive mutations, we generated a hyper–interferon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive (HIS) virus as a vaccine candidate. HIS virus is highly attenuated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses, elicits robust humoral and cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses, and provides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ion against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our approach, which attenuates the virus and promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses concurrently, is broadly applicable for vaccine development against other pathogens.</p>

Escaping the traps of your own hunters
<p>During the first days of an infection, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ion is almost entirely provided by innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, a large part of which consists of one type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cell—the neutrophil. Neutrophils form the largest group of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cells in the body [humans produce ∼10<sup>11</sup> neutrophils daily (<i>1</i>)], and they carry out a number of defense mechanisms, including pathogen ingestion (phagocytosis) and the production of toxic chemicals that kill intruders directly. They can also cause severe hyperinflammatory diseases, such as lethal influenza-associated lung destruction (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). In 2004, another neutrophil defense system was discovered. In a final act of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ion, dying neutrophils mix their nuclear DNA with toxic components from their cytosolic granules and release it explosively to form a neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in the surrounding environment. This process is called NETosis (<i>4</i>). In addition to carrying genetic information, DNA is a very long (each nucleus contains ∼2 m of DNA) and sticky polyanionic molecule. Hence, DNA binds to surfaces such as bacterial cell walls by means of charge interactions (<i>5</i>). Through this immobilization on NETs, pathogens are brought into direct contact with cytotoxic molecules on the NET-DNA complex. However, free extracellular DNA is also a potent trigger of severe side effects in the body, for example, by forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complexes with anti nuclear antibodies (antibodies that can bind to DNA) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (<i>6</i>) or by directly clogging blood vessels and establishing vessel-blocking thrombi (<i>7</i>). Consequently, finding mechanisms that mediate the degradation of NETs has been a matter of intense research. On page 1202 of this issue, Jiménez-Alcéázar <i>et al.</i> (<i>8</i>) describe two deoxyribonucleases (DNases) [DNase1 and DNase1-like 3 (DNase1L3)], which cleave DNA and together degrade freshly formed NETs. By doing so, they inhibit otherwise lethal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>opathologies such as thrombus-mediated organ failure.</p>

Reovirus infection triggers inflammatory responses to dietary antigens and development of celiac disease
<p>Viral infections have been proposed to elicit pathological processes leading to the initiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity against dietary gluten and celiac disease (CeD). To test this hypothesis and gain insights into mechanisms underlying virus-induced loss of tolerance to dietary antigens, we developed a viral infection model that makes use of two reovirus strains that infect the intestine but differ in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>opathological outcomes. Reovirus is an avirulent pathogen that elicits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, but we discovered that it can nonetheless disrupt intestinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e homeostasis at inductive and effector sites of oral tolerance by suppressing peripheral regulatory T cell (pT<sub>reg</sub>) conversion and promoting T<sub>H</sub>1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to dietary antigen. Initiation of T<sub>H</sub>1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity to dietary antigen was dependent on interferon regulatory factor 1 and dissociated from suppression of pT<sub>reg</sub> conversion, which was mediated by type-1 interferon. Last, our study in humans supports a role for infection with reovirus, a seemingly innocuous virus, in triggering the development of CeD.</p>

Roles of Receptor-Like Cytoplasmic Kinase VII Members in Pattern-Triggered Immune Signaling
<p>Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which consist of receptor kinases (RKs) and receptor-like proteins, sense microbe- and host-derived molecular patterns associated with pathogen infection to trigger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses in plants. Several kinases of the 46-member Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK) subfamily VII play important roles in pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, but it is unclear whether different RLCK VII members act specifically or redundantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling. Here, we constructed nine higher order mutants of this subfamily (named <i>rlck vii-1</i> to <i>rlck vii-9</i>) and systematically characterized their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e phenotypes. The mutants <i>rlck vii-5</i>, -<i>7</i>, and -<i>8</i> had compromised reactive oxygen species production in response to all patterns tested, indicating that the corresponding members are broadly required for the signaling of multiple PRRs. However, <i>rlck vii-4</i> was defective specifically in chitin-induced reactive oxygen species production, suggesting that RCLK VII-4 members mediate the signaling of specific PRRs. Furthermore, RLCK VII-4 members were required for the chitin-triggered activation of MAPK, demonstrating that these kinases link a PRR to MAPK activation. Moreover, we found that RLCK VII-6 and -8 also were required for RK-mediated root growth. Together, these results show that numerous RLCK VII members are involved in pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling and uncover both common and specific roles of these kinases in plant development and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity mediated by various RKs.</p>

Modulation of Plant Salicylic Acid-Associated Immune Responses via Glycosylation of Dihydroxybenzoic Acids
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) plays a crucial role in plant innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. The deployment of SA-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses is primarily affected by SA concentration, which is determined by a balance between SA biosynthesis and catabolism. However, the mechanisms regulating SA homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we characterized a unique UDP-glycosyltransferase, UGT76D1, which plays an important role in SA homeostasis and associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Expression of <i>UGT76D1</i> was induced by treatment with both the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000 and SA. Overexpression of <i>UGT76D1</i> resulted in high SA accumulation, significant up-regulation of pathogen-related genes, and a hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive response (HR)-like lesion mimic phenotype. This HR-like phenotype was not observed following <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression in SA-deficient <i>NahG</i> transgenic or <i>sid2</i> plants, suggesting that the phenotype is SA dependent. Biochemical assays showed that UGT76D1 glycosylated 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA), the major catabolic forms of SA, to their Glc and Xyl conjugates in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in a mutant background blocked in the formation of 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA, <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression did not cause a HR-like lesion mimic phenotype. Following infection with <i>Pst</i> DC3000, <i>UGT76D1</i> knockout mutants displayed a delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response, with reduced levels of DHBA glycosides and SA, and down-regulated SA synthase expression. By contrast, <i>UGT76D1</i> overexpression lines showed an enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response and increased SA biosynthesis before and after pathogen infection. Thus, we propose that UGT76D1 plays an important role in SA homeostasis and plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses by facilitating glycosylation of dihydroxybenzoic acids.</p>

RXLR Effector AVR2 Up-Regulates a Brassinosteroid-Responsive bHLH Transcription Factor to Suppress Immunity
<p>An emerging area in plant research focuses on antagonism between regulatory systems governing growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Such cross talk represents a point of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vulner</span></strong>ability for pathogens to exploit. AVR2, an RXLR effector secreted by the potato blight pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>, interacts with potato BSL1, a putative phosphatase implicated in growth-promoting brassinosteroid (BR) hormone signaling. Transgenic potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) plants expressing the effector exhibit transcriptional and phenotypic hallmarks of overactive BR signaling and show enhanced susceptibility to <i>P. infestans</i>. Microarray analysis was used to identify a set of BR-responsive marker genes in potato, all of which are constitutively expressed to BR-induced levels in AVR2 transgenic lines. One of these genes was a bHLH transcription factor, designated <i>StCHL1</i>, homologous to <i>AtCIB1</i> and <i>AtHBI1</i>, which are known to facilitate antagonism between BR and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses. Transient expression of either AVR2 or CHL1 enhanced leaf colonization by <i>P. infestans</i> and compromised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e cell death activated by perception of the elicitin Infestin1 (INF1). Knockdown of <i>CHL1</i> transcript using Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) reduced colonization of <i>P. infestans</i> on <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Moreover, the ability of AVR2 to suppress INF1-triggered cell death was attenuated in <i>NbCHL1</i>-silenced plants, indicating that NbCHL1 was important for this effector activity. Thus, AVR2 exploits cross talk between BR signaling and innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in <i>Solanum</i> species, representing a novel, indirect mode of innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e suppression by a filamentous pathogen effector.</p>

An E3 Ligase Affects the NLR Receptor Stability and Immunity to Powdery Mildew
<p>Following the detection of pathogen cognate effectors, plant Nod-like receptors (NLRs) trigger isolate-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity that is generally associated with cell death. The regulation of NLR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity is important to ensure effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. In barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the allelic Mildew locus A (MLA) receptors mediate isolate-specific disease resistance against powdery mildew fungus (<i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>). Currently, how MLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity is controlled remains unknown. Here, we identified an MLA-interacting RING-type E3 ligase, MIR1, that interacts with several MLAs. We showed that the carboxyl-terminal TPR domain of MIR1 mediates the interaction with the coiled-coil domain-containing region of functional MLAs, such as MLA1, MLA6, and MLA10, but not with that of the nonfunctional MLA18-1. MIR1 can ubiquitinate the amino-terminal region of MLAs in vitro and promotes the proteasomal degradation of MLAs in vitro and in planta. Both proteasome inhibitor treatment and virus-induced gene silencing-mediated <i>MIR1</i> silencing significantly increased MLA abundance in barley transgenic lines. Furthermore, overexpression of MIR1 specifically compromised MLA-mediated disease resistance in barley, while coexpression of MIR1 and MLA10 attenuated MLA10-induced cell death signaling in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Together, our data reveal a mechanism for the control of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of MLA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e receptors and for the attenuation of MLA-triggered defense signaling by a RING-type E3 ligase via the ubiquitin proteasome system.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Low Water Potential and At14a-Like1 (AFL1) Effects on Endocytosis and Actin Filament Organization
<p>At14a-Like1 (AFL1) is a stress-induced protein of unknown function that promotes growth during low water potential stress and drought. Previous analysis indicated that AFL1 may have functions related to endocytosis and regulation of actin filament organization, processes for which the effects of low water potential are little known. We found that low water potential led to a decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the membrane-im<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">permeabl</span></strong>e dye FM4-64. Ectopic expression of AFL1 reversed the decrease in FM4-64 uptake seen in wild type, while reduced AFL1 expression led to further inhibition of FM4-64 uptake. Increased AFL1 also made FM4-64 uptake less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive to the actin filament disruptor Latrunculin B (LatB). LatB decreased AFL1-Clathrin Light Chain colocalization, further indicating that effects of AFL1 on endocytosis may be related to actin filament organization or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic AFL1 expression made actin filaments less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive to disruption by LatB or Cytochalasin D and led to increased actin filament skewness and decreased occupancy, indicative of more bundled actin filaments. This latter effect could be partially mimicked by the actin filament <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izer Jasplakinolide (JASP). However, AFL1 did not substantially inhibit actin filament dynamics, indicating that AFL1 acts via a different mechanism than JASP-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ization. AFL1 partially colocalized with actin filaments but not with microtubules, further indicating actin-filament–related function of AFL1. These data provide insight into endocytosis and actin filament responses to low water potential stress and demonstrate an involvement of AFL1 in these key cellular processes.</p>

However, the identity of proteins and the residues <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive to oxidation during the plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response remain largely unknown. Previous studies of the thimet oligopeptidases TOP1 and TOP2 placed them in the salicylic acid dependent branch of ETI, with a current model wherein TOPs sustain interconnected organellar and cytosolic pathways that modulate the oxidative burst and development of cell death. Herein, we characterized the ETI redoxomes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) wild-type Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> mutant plants using a differential alkylation-based enrichment technique coupled with label-free mass spectrometry-based quantification. We identified cysteines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive to oxidation in a wide range of protein families at multiple time points after pathogen infection. Differences were detected between Col-0 and <i>top1top2</i> redoxomes regarding the identity and number of oxidized cysteines, and the amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in protein oxidation. Our results support a determining role for TOPs in maintaining the proper level and dynamics of proteome oxidation during ETI. This study significantly expands the repertoire of oxidation-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive plant proteins and can guide future mechanistic studies.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As water often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant water capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of water across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root water transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of water pathways and root radial hydraulic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream hydraulic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the convection-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffus</span></strong>ion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of water-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conduct</span></strong>ivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of water flow across roots. The explicit root hydraulic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root water relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root hydraulics.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry seeds are highly resilient plant structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protect</span></strong>ed and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. Seed viability is heavily dependent on the seed coat’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the seed coat, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during seed development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature seed’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived seed coat pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of seed coat development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high seed coat permeability, resulting in lower seed viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the seed’s physiological properties.</p>

BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE1 Phosphorylates MAPKKK5 to Regulate Immunity in Arabidopsis
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e receptor FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2) rapidly forms a complex to activate pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity (PTI) upon perception of the bacterial protein flagellin. The receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALINGKINASE1 (BSK1) interacts with FLS2 and is critical for the activation of PTI. However, it is unknown how BSK1 transduces signals to activate downstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses. We identified MEK Kinase5 (MAPKKK5) as a potential substrate of BSK1 by whole-genome phosphorylation analysis. In addition, we demonstrated that BSK1 interacts with and phosphorylates MAPKKK5. In the <i>bsk1</i>-<i>1</i> mutant, the Ser-289 residue of MAPKKK5 was not phosphorylated as it was in the wild type. Similar to the <i>bsk1</i> mutant, the <i>mapkkk5</i> mutant displayed enhanced susceptibility to virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000, and to the fungal powdery mildew pathogen <i>Golovinomyces cichoracearum</i>. Phosphorylation of the Ser-289 residue is not involved in MAPKKK5-triggered cell death but is critical for MAPKKK5-mediated resistance to both bacterial and fungal pathogens. Furthermore, MAPKKK5 interacts with multiple MAPK kinases, including MKK1, MKK2, MKK4, MKK5, and MKK6. Overall, these results indicate that BSK1 regulates plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity by phosphorylating MAPKKK5 and suggest a direct regulatory mode of signaling from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e complex to the MAPK cascade.</p>

Different Modes of Negative Regulation of Plant Immunity by Calmodulin-Related Genes
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses activated through the perception of microbe-associated molecular patterns, leading to pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity, are tightly regulated. This results in low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e responses in the absence of pathogens and a rapid return to the resting state following an activation event. Here, we show that two <i>CALMODULIN-LIKE</i> genes, <i>CML46</i> and <i>CML47</i>, negatively regulate salicylic acid accumulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The double mutant <i>cml46 cml47</i> is highly resistant to the pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> (<i>Pma</i>). The effects of <i>cml46 cml47</i> on <i>Pma</i> growth are genetically additive to that of <i>cbp60a</i>, a known negative regulator in the <i>CALMODULIN-BINDING PROTEIN60</i> (<i>CBP60</i>) family. Transcriptome profiling revealed the effects of <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> on both common and separate sets of genes, with the majorities of these differentially expressed genes being <i>Pma</i> responsive. <i>CBP60g</i>, a positive regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in the <i>CBP60</i> family, was found to be transcriptionally regulated by <i>CBP60a</i>, <i>CML46</i>, and <i>CML47</i>. Analysis of the flg22-induced mRNA levels of <i>CBP60g</i> in <i>cbp60a</i> and <i>cml46 cml47</i> revealed that <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants have higher induced expression while <i>cbp60a</i> plants retain elevated levels longer than wild-type plants. Assays for the effect of flg22 treatment on <i>Pma</i> growth showed that the effect is stronger in <i>cml46 cml47</i> plants and lasts longer in <i>cbp60a</i> plants. Thus, the expression pattern of <i>CBP60g</i> is reflected in flg22-induced resistance to <i>Pma</i>.</p>

The Kinase OsCPK4 Regulates a Buffering Mechanism That Fine-Tunes Innate Immunity
<p>The calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 has been demonstrated to play important roles in salt and drought tolerance, plant growth, and development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying OsCPK4 function in rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. In this study, we demonstrated that the generation of oxidative burst and pathogenesis-related gene expression triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns were significantly enhanced in the <i>oscpk4</i> mutants. These mutant lines are more resistant to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases than the wild-type plants, indicating that OsCPK4 negatively regulates innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in rice. OsCPK4 was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176. OsRLCK176 accumulation is negatively regulated by OsCPK4. Interestingly, the kinase-dead OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation more strongly than the wild-type protein. OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 mutually phosphorylate each other and form a feedback loop. Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 contribute to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of OsRLCK176. These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation and restricts plant defenses, whereas the activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 degradation machinery, thus enhancing plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Collectively, the study proposes a novel defense buffering mechanism mediated by OsCPK4, which fine-tunes microbe-associated molecular pattern-triggered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity in rice.</p>

Capping Protein Modulates Actin Remodeling in Response to Reactive Oxygen Species during Plant Innate Immunity
<p>Plants perceive microbe-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns to activate innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling events, such as bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The actin cytoskeleton remodels during the first 5 min of innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signaling in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) epidermal cells; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e signals that impinge on actin cytoskeleton and its response regulators remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that rapid actin remodeling upon elicitation with diverse microbe-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns represent a conserved plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>e response. Actin remodeling requires ROS generated by the defense-associated NADPH oxidase, RBOHD. Moreover, perception of flg22 by its cognate receptor complex triggers actin remodeling through the activation of RBOHD-dependent ROS production. Our genetic studies reveal that the ubiquitous heterodimeric capping protein transduces ROS signaling to the actin cytoskeleton during innate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">immun</span></strong>ity. Additionally, we uncover a negative feedback loop between actin remodeling and flg22-induced ROS production.</p>

Clinical Outcomes and Cost-Effectiveness of Fractional Flow Reserve–Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies found that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not improve outcome compared with medical therapy (MT) in patients with stable coronary artery disease, but PCI was guided by angiography alone. FAME 2 trial (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) compared PCI guided by fractional flow reserve with best MT in patients with stable coronary artery disease to assess clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 888 patients with stable single-vessel or multivessel coronary artery disease with reduced fractional flow reserve were randomly assigned to PCI plus MT (n=447) or MT alone (n=441). Major adverse cardiac events included death, myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization. Costs were calculated on the basis of resource use and Medicare reimbursement rates. Changes in quality-adjusted life-years were assessed with utilities determined by the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions health survey at baseline and over follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Major adverse cardiac events at 3 years were significantly lower in the PCI group compared with the MT group (10.1% versus 22.0%; <i>P</i><0.001), primarily as a result of a lower rate of urgent revascularization (4.3% versus 17.2%; <i>P</i><0.001). Death and myocardial infarction were numerically lower in the PCI group (8.3% versus 10.4%; <i>P</i>=0.28). Angina was significantly less severe in the PCI group at all follow-up points to 3 years. Mean initial costs were higher in the PCI group ($9944 versus $4440; <i>P</i><0.001) but by 3 years were similar between the 2 groups ($16 792 versus $16 737; <i>P</i>=0.94). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PCI compared with MT was $17 300 per quality-adjusted life-year at 2 years and $1600 per quality-adjusted life-year at 3 years. The above findings were robust in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>ConclusionS:</title><p>PCI of lesions with reduced fractional flow reserve improves long-term outcome and is economically attractive compared with MT alone in patients with stable coronary artery disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

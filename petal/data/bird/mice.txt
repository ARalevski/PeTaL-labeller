Elabela/Toddler Is an Endogenous Agonist of the Apelin APJ Receptor in the Adult Cardiovascular System, and Exogenous Administration of the Peptide Compensates for the Downregulation of Its Expression in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elabela/toddler (ELA) is a critical cardiac developmental peptide that acts through the G-protein–coupled apelin receptor, despite lack of sequence similarity to the established ligand apelin. Our aim was to investigate the receptor pharmacology, expression pattern, and in vivo function of ELA peptides in the adult cardiovascular system, to seek evidence for alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in which apelin signaling is downregulated, and to demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e attenuation of PAH severity with exogenous administ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion of ELA in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p><i>In silico</i> docking analysis, competition binding experiments, and downstream assays were used to characterize ELA receptor binding in human heart and signaling in cells expressing the apelin receptor. ELA expression in human cardiovascular tissues and plasma was determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, dual-labeling immunofluorescent staining, and immunoassays. Acute cardiac effects of ELA-32 and [Pyr<sup>1</sup>]apelin-13 were assessed by MRI and cardiac catheterization in anesthetized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s. Cardiopulmonary human and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> tissues from PAH patients and monocrotaline- and Sugen/hypoxia-exposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s were used to show changes in ELA expression in PAH. The effect of ELA treatment on cardiopulmonary remodeling in PAH was investigated in the monocrotaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>ELA competed for binding of apelin in human heart with overlap for the 2 peptides indicated by <i>in silico</i> modeling. ELA activated G-protein– and β-arrestin–dependent pathways. We detected ELA expression in human vascular endothelium and plasma. Comparable to apelin, ELA increased cardiac contractility, ejection fraction, and cardiac output and elicited vasodilatation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> in vivo. ELA expression was reduced in cardiopulmonary tissues from PAH patients and PAH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> models, respectively. ELA treatment significantly attenuated elevation of right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular remodeling in monocrotaline-exposed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results show that ELA is an endogenous agonist of the human apelin receptor, exhibits a cardiovascular profile comparable to apelin, and is downregulated in human disease and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rodent</span></strong> PAH models, and exogenous peptide can reduce the severity of cardiopulmonary remodeling and function in PAH in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s. This study provides additional proof of principle that an apelin receptor agonist may be of therapeutic use in PAH in humans.</p></sec>

Delayed Repolarization Underlies Ventricular Arrhythmias in Rats With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents approximately half of heart failure, and its incidence continues to increase. The leading cause of mortality in HFpEF is sudden death, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Dahl salt-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s were fed a high-salt diet (8% NaCl) from 7 weeks of age to induce HFpEF (n=38). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s fed a normal-salt diet (0.3% NaCl) served as controls (n=13). Echocardiograms were performed to assess systolic and diastolic function from 14 weeks of age. HFpEF-verified and control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s underwent programmed electrical stimulation. Corrected QT interval was measured by surface ECG. The mechanisms of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) were probed by optical mapping, whole-cell patch clamp to measure action potential du<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion and ionic currents, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to investigate changes in ion channel expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After 7 weeks of a high-salt diet, 31 of 38 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s showed diastolic dysfunction and preserved ejection fraction along with signs of heart failure and hence were diagnosed with HFpEF. Programmed electric stimulation demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed increased susceptibility to VA in HFpEF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s (<i>P</i><0.001 versus controls). The arrhythmogenicity index was increased (<i>P</i><0.001) and the corrected QT interval on ECG was prolonged (<i>P</i><0.001) in HFpEF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s. Optical mapping of HFpEF hearts demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed prolonged action potentials (<i>P</i><0.05) and multiple reentry circuits during induced VA. Single-cell recordings of cardiomyocytes isolated from HFpEF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s confirmed a delay of repolarization (<i>P</i>=0.001) and revealed downregulation of transient outward potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>; <i>P</i><0.05). The rapid components of the delayed rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>Kr</sub>) and the inward rectifier potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>K1</sub>) were also downregulated (<i>P</i><0.05), but the current densities were much lower than for <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>. In accordance with the reduction of <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>, both <i>Kcnd3</i> transcript and Kv4.3 protein levels were decreased in HFpEF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Susceptibility to VA was markedly increased in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s with HFpEF. Underlying abnormalities include QT prolongation, delayed repolarization from downregulation of potassium currents, and multiple reentry circuits during VA. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that potassium current downregulation leads to abnormal repolarization in HFpEF, which in turn predisposes to VA and sudden cardiac death.</p></sec>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Pharmacological preconditioning with erythropoietin attenuates the organ injury and dysfunction induced in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock
<p>Pre-treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) has been demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed to exert tissue-protective effects against ‘ischemia-reperfusion’-type injuries. This protection might be mediated by mobilization of bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are thought to secrete paracrine factors. These effects could be exploited to protect against tissue injury induced in cases where hemorrhage is foreseeable, for example, prior to major surgery. Here, we investigate the effects of EPO pre-treatment on the organ injury and dysfunction induced by hemorrhagic shock (HS). Recombinant human EPO (1000 IU/kg/day i.p.) was administered to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s for 3 days. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s were subjected to HS on day 4 (pre-treatment protocol). Mean arterial pressure was reduced to 35±5 mmHg for 90 minutes, followed by resuscitation with 20 ml/kg Ringer’s lactate for 10 minutes and 50% of the shed blood for 50 minutes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s were sacrificed 4 hours after the onset of resuscitation. EPC (CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cell) mobilization was measured following the 3-day pre-treatment with EPO and was significantly increased compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s pre-treated with phosphate-buffered saline. EPO pre-treatment significantly attenuated organ injury and dysfunction (renal, hepatic and neuromuscular) caused by HS. In livers from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s subjected to HS, EPO enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt (activation), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β; inhibition) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; activation). In the liver, HS also caused an increase in nuclear translocation of p65 (activation of NF-κB), which was attenuated by EPO. This data suggests that repetitive dosing with EPO prior to injury might protect against the organ injury and dysfunction induced by HS, by a mechanism that might involve mobilization of CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cells, resulting in the activation of the Akt-eNOS survival pathway and inhibition of activation of GSK-3β and NF-κB.</p>

Platelets Express Activated P2Y<sub>12</sub> Receptor in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Platelets from patients with diabetes mellitus are hyperactive.

The antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects of AR-C78511 and cangrelor were compared in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s. Finally, we explored the role of the nuclear factor-κB pathway in regulating P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor expression in megakaryocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> levels are 4-fold higher in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with healthy subjects. P2Y<sub>12</sub> expression correlates with ADP-induced platelet aggregation (r=0.89, <i>P</i><0.01). P2Y<sub>12</sub> in platelets from patients with diabetes mellitus is constitutively activated. Although both AR-C78511, a potent P2Y<sub>12</sub> inverse agonist, and cangrelor have similar antiplatelet efficacy on platelets from healthy subjects, AR-C78511 exhibits more powerful antiplatelet effects on diabetic platelets than cangrelor (aggregation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>io 36±3% versus 49±5%, respectively, <i>P</i><0.05).

The microRNA miR-7a-5p ameliorates ischemic brain damage by repressing α-synuclein
<p>Ischemic stroke, which is caused by a clot that blocks blood flow to the brain, can be severely disabling and sometimes fatal. We previously showed that transient focal ischemia in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> model induces extensive temporal changes in the expression of cerebral microRNAs, with a sustained decrease in the abundance of miR-7a-5p (miR-7). Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of a miR-7 mimic oligonucleotide after cerebral ischemia in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rodent</span></strong>s according to the Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) criteria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rodent</span></strong>s were injected locally or systemically with miR-7 mimic before or after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Decreased miR-7 expression was observed in both young and aged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s of both sexes after cerebral ischemia. Pre- or postischemic treatment with miR-7 mimic decreased the lesion volume in both sexes and ages studied. Furthermore, systemic injection of miR-7 mimic into mice at 30 min (but not 2 hours) after cerebral ischemia substantially decreased the lesion volume and improved motor and cognitive functional recovery with minimal peripheral toxicity. The miR-7 mimic treatment substantially reduced the postischemic induction of α-synuclein (α-Syn), a protein that induces mitochondrial fragmentation, oxidative stress, and autophagy that promote neuronal cell death. Deletion of the gene encoding α-Syn abolished miR-7 mimic–dependent neuroprotection and functional recovery in young male mice. Further analysis confirmed that the transcript encoding α-Syn was bound and repressed by miR-7. Our findings suggest that miR-7 mimics may therapeutically minimize stroke-induced brain damage and disability.</p>

Sphingosine 1-phosphate stimulates eyelid closure in the developing rat by stimulating EGFR signaling
<p>In many mammals, the eyelids mig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e over the eye and fuse during embryogenesis to protect the cornea from damage during birth and early life. Loss-of-function mutations affecting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway cause an eyes-open-at-birth (EOB) phenotype in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rodent</span></strong>s. We identified an insertional mutation in <i>Spinster homolog 2</i> (<i>Spns2</i>) in a strain of transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s exhibiting the EOB phenotype. Spns2, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) transporter that releases S1P from cells, was enriched at the tip of developing eyelids in wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> embryos. <i>Spns2</i> expression or treatment with S1P or any one of several EGFR ligands rescued the EOB <i>Spns2</i> mutant phenotype in vivo and in tissue explants in vitro and rescued the formation of stress fibers in primary ke<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>inocytes from mutants. S1P signaled through the receptors S1PR1, S1PR2, and S1PR3 to activate extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and EGFR-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1)–c-Jun signaling. S1P also induced the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor MAL in a manner dependent on EGFR signaling. MAL and c-Jun stimulated the expression of the microRNAs <i>miR-21</i> and <i>miR-222</i>, both of which target the metalloprotease inhibitor TIMP3, thus promoting metalloprotease activity. The metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 stimulated EGFR signaling by cleaving a membrane-anchored form of EGF to release the ligand. Our results outline a network by which S1P transactivates EGFR signaling through a complex mechanism involving feedback between several intra- and extracellular molecules to promote eyelid fusion in the developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>.</p>

Decreased abundance of TRESK two-pore domain potassium channels in sensory neurons underlies the pain associated with bone metastasis
<p>Cancer-associated pain is debilitating. Understanding the mechanisms that cause it can inform drug development that may improve quality of life in patients. Here, we found that the reduced abundance of potassium channels called TRESK in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons sensitized nociceptive sensory neurons and cancer-associated pain. Overexpressing TRESK in DRG neurons suppressed tumor-induced neuronal hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in bone metastasis model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s, whereas knocking down TRESK increased neuronal hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity in normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s. Mechanistically, tumor-associated production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activated the receptor VEGFR2 on DRGs, which increased the abundance of the calcineurin inhibitor DSCR1, which, in turn, decreased calcineurin-mediated activation of the transcription factor NFAT, thereby reducing the transcription of the gene encoding TRESK. Int<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>hecal application of exogenous calcineurin to tumor-bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s rescued TRESK abundance and abrogated both DRG hyperexcitability and pain hypersensitivity, whereas either inhibition or knockdown of calcineurin in normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s reduced TRESK abundance and increased DRG excitability and pain sensitivity. These findings identify a potentially targetable mechanism that may cause bone metastasis–associated pain in cancer patients.</p>

Nigeria hit by unprecedented Lassa fever outbreak
<p>In the first 2 months of this year, Nigeria has had more confirmed cases of Lassa fever, a hemorrhagic disease that kills 20% to 30% of those it sickens, than in any previous year. As of 11 March, the toll from this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rodent</span></strong>-borne virus stood at 365 confirmed cases, 16 of those among vulnerable health care workers, and 114 deaths. And those figures are widely considered an underestimate. As the government and its international partners scramble to set up isolation wards and deliver protective gear to health workers, researchers on three continents are racing to figure out what is driving the unprecedented outbreak and what it portends for the future. Is it simply better disease surveillance in the wake of Ebola, the similar but more deadly disease that began its rampage across West Africa in 2014? Has the virus changed in some way? Are there more of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s that carry it, or are more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s infected with it? Or is another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> capable of spreading the virus as well?

Palmitoylation of δ-catenin promotes kinesin-mediated membrane trafficking of Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 in sensory neurons to promote neuropathic pain
<p>Palmitoylation of δ-catenin is critical to synapse plasticity and memory formation. We found that δ-catenin palmitoylation is also instrumental in the development of neuropathic pain. The abundances of palmitoylated δ-catenin and the palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC3 were increased in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> models of neuropathic pain. Inhibiting palmitoyl acyltransferases or decreasing δ-catenin abundance in the DRG by int<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>hecal injection of 2-bromopalmitate or shRNA, respectively, alleviated oxaliplatin or nerve injury–induced neuropathic pain in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s. The palmitoylation of δ-catenin, which was induced by the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, facilitated its interaction with the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 and the kinesin motor protein KIF3A, which promoted the trafficking of Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 to the plasma membrane in DRG neurons and contributed to mechanical hypersensitivity and allodynia in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s. These findings suggest that a palmitoylation-mediated KIF3A/δ-catenin/Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 complex enhances the transmission of mechanical and nociceptive signals; thus, blocking this mechanism may be therapeutic in patients with neuropathic pain.</p>

A systems approach for discovering linoleic acid derivatives that potentially mediate pain and itch
<p>Chronic pain and itch are common hypersensitivity syndromes that are affected by endogenous mediators. We applied a systems-based, translational approach to predict, discover, and characterize mediators of pain and itch that are regulated by diet and inflammation. Profiling of tissue-specific precursor abundance and biosynthetic gene expression predicted that inflamed skin would be abundant in four previously unknown 11-hydroxy-epoxy- or 11-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic acid derivatives and four previously identified 9- or 13-hydroxy-epoxy- or 9- or 13-keto-epoxy-octadecenoate linoleic acid derivatives. All of these mediators were confirmed to be abundant in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> and human skin by mass spectrometry. However, only the two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates sensitized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> dorsal root ganglion neurons to release more calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP), which is involved in pain transmission, in response to low pH (which mimics an inflammatory state) or capsaicin (which activates ion channels involved in nociception). The two 11-hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoates share a 3-hydroxy-<i>Z</i>-pentenyl-<i>E</i>-epoxide moiety, thus suggesting that this substructure could mediate nociceptor sensitization. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s, intradermal hind paw injection of 11-hydroxy-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(9<i>Z</i>)-octadecenoate elicited C-fiber–mediated sensitivity to thermal pain. In a randomized trial testing adjunctive st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>egies to manage refractory chronic headaches, reducing the dietary intake of linoleic acid was associated with decreases in plasma 11-hydroxy-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(9<i>Z</i>)-octadecenoate, which correlated with clinical pain reduction. Human psoriatic skin had 30-fold higher 9-keto-12,13-<i>trans</i>-epoxy-(10<i>E</i>)-octadecenoate compared to control skin, and intradermal injection of this compound induced itch-related sc<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ching behavior in mice. Collectively, these findings define a family of endogenous mediators with potential roles in pain and itch.</p>

A molecular mechanism for choosing alcohol over an alternative reward
<p>Alcohol addiction leads to increased choice of alcohol over healthy rewards. We established an exclusive choice procedure in which ~15% of outbred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s chose alcohol over a high-value reward. These animals displayed addiction-like traits, including high motivation to obtain alcohol and pursuit of this drug despite adverse consequences. Expression of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter GAT-3 was selectively decreased within the amygdala of alcohol-choosing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s, whereas a knockdown of this transcript reversed choice preference of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s that originally chose a sweet solution over alcohol. GAT-3 expression was selectively decreased in the central amygdala of alcohol-dependent people compared to those who died of unrelated causes. Impaired GABA clearance within the amygdala contributes to alcohol addiction, appears to translate between species, and may offer targets for new pharmacotherapies for treating this disorder.</p>

A small-molecule inhibitor of TRPC5 ion channels suppresses progressive kidney disease in animal models
<p>Progressive kidney diseases are often associated with scarring of the kidney’s filt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion unit, a condition called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). This scarring is due to loss of podocytes, cells critical for glomerular filt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion, and leads to proteinuria and kidney failure. Inherited forms of FSGS are caused by Rac1-activating mutations, and Rac1 induces TRPC5 ion channel activity and cytoskeletal remodeling in podocytes. Whether TRPC5 activity mediates FSGS onset and progression is unknown. We identified a small molecule, AC1903, that specifically blocks TRPC5 channel activity in glomeruli of proteinuric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s. Chronic administ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion of AC1903 suppressed severe proteinuria and prevented podocyte loss in a transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> model of FSGS. AC1903 also provided therapeutic benefit in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> model of hypertensive proteinuric kidney disease.

Neural correlates of ticklishness in the rat somatosensory cortex
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s emit ultrasonic vocalizations in response to tickling by humans. Tickling is rewarding through dopaminergic mechanisms, but the function and neural correlates of ticklishness are unknown. We confirmed that tickling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s evoked vocalizations, approach, and unsolicited jumps (Freudensprünge). Recordings in the trunk region of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> somatosensory cortex showed intense tickling-evoked activity in most neurons, whereas a minority of cells were suppressed by tickling. Tickling responses predicted nontactile neural responses to play behaviors, which suggests a neuronal link between tickling and play. Anxiogenic conditions suppressed tickling-evoked vocalizations and trunk cortex activity.

Targeting Chondroitin Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis in Pathological Remodeling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and the search for novel therapeutic approaches continues. In the monogenic disease mucopolysaccharidosis VI, loss-of-function mutations in arylsulfatase B lead to myocardial accumulation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans, manifesting as myriad cardiac symptoms. Here, we studied changes in myocardial CS in nonmucopolysaccharidosis failing hearts and assessed its generic role in pathological cardiac remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Healthy and diseased human and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> left ventricles were subjected to histological and immunostaining methods to analyze glycosaminoglycan distribution. Glycosaminoglycans were extracted and analyzed for quantitative and compositional changes with Alcian blue assay and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Expression changes in 20 CS-related genes were studied in 3 primary human cardiac cell types and THP-1–derived macrophages under each of 9 in vitro stimulatory conditions. In 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> models of pathological remodeling induced by transverse aortic constriction or isoprenaline infusion, recombinant human arylsulfatase B (rhASB), clinically used as enzyme replacement therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis VI, was administered intravenously for 7 or 5 weeks, respectively. Cardiac function, myocardial fibrosis, and inflammation were assessed by echocardiography and histology. CS-interacting molecules were assessed with surface plasmon resonance, and a mechanism of action was verified in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Failing human hearts displayed significant perivascular and interstitial CS accumulation, particularly in regions of intense fibrosis. Relative composition of CS disaccharides remained unchanged. Transforming growth factor–β induced CS upregulation in cardiac fibroblasts. CS accumulation was also observed in both the pressure-overload and the isoprenaline models of pathological remodeling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s. Early treatment with rhASB in the transverse aortic constriction model and delayed treatment in the isoprenaline model proved rhASB to be effective at preventing cardiac deterio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion and augmenting functional recovery. Functional improvement was accompanied by reduced myocardial inflammation and overall fibrosis. Tumor necrosis factor–α was identified as a direct binding partner of CS glycosaminoglycan chains, and rhASB reduced tumor necrosis factor–α—induced inflammatory gene activation in vitro in endothelial cells and macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CS glycosaminoglycans accumulate during cardiac pathological remodeling and mediate myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. rhASB targets CS effectively as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of heart failure.</p></sec>

Dedifferentiation, Proliferation, and Redifferentiation of Adult Mammalian Cardiomyocytes After Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Adult mammalian hearts have a limited ability to gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e new cardiomyocytes. Prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion of existing adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs) is a potential source of new cardiomyocytes. Understanding the fundamental biology of ACM prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion could be of great clinical significance for treating myocardial infarction (MI). We aim to understand the process and regulation of ACM prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion and its role in new cardiomyocyte formation of post-MI mouse hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>β-Actin-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice and fate-mapping Myh6-MerCreMer-tdTomato/lacZ mice were used to trace the fate of ACMs. In a coculture system with neonatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> ventricular myocytes, ACM prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion was documented with clear evidence of cytokinesis observed with time-lapse imaging. Cardiomyocyte prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion in the adult mouse post-MI heart was detected by cell cycle markers and 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine incorpo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion analysis. Echocardiography was used to measure cardiac function, and histology was performed to determine infarction size.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vitro, mononucleated and bi/multinucleated ACMs were able to prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e at a similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e (7.0%) in the coculture. Dedifferentiation proceeded ACM prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion, which was followed by redifferentiation. Redifferentiation was essential to endow the daughter cells with cardiomyocyte contractile function. Intercellular propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from contracting neonatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> ventricular myocytes into ACM daughter cells was required to activate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cell signaling pathway to induce ACM redifferentiation. The properties of neonatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> ventricular myocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients influenced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e of ACM redifferentiation. Hypoxia impaired the function of gap junctions by dephosphorylating its component protein connexin 43, the major mediator of intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation between cardiomyocytes, thereby impairing ACM redifferentiation. In vivo, ACM prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion was found primarily in the MI border zone. An ischemia-resistant connexin 43 mutant enhanced the redifferentiation of ACM-derived new cardiomyocytes after MI and improved cardiac function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Mature ACMs can reenter the cell cycle and form new cardiomyocytes through a 3-step process: dedifferentiation, prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion, and redifferentiation. Intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal from neighboring functioning cardiomyocytes through gap junctions induces the redifferentiation process. This novel mechanism contributes to new cardiomyocyte formation in post-MI hearts in mammals.</p></sec>

Existence, Functional Impairment, and Lung Repair Potential of Endothelial Colony-Forming Cells in Oxygen-Induced Arrested Alveolar Growth
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and emphysema are life-threatening diseases resulting from impaired alveolar development or alveolar destruction. Both conditions lack effective therapies. Angiogenic growth factors promote alveolar growth and contribute to alveolar maintenance. Endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) represent a subset of circulating and resident endothelial cells capable of self-renewal and de novo vessel formation. We hypothesized that resident ECFCs exist in the developing lung, that they are impaired during arrested alveolar growth in experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and that exogenous ECFCs restore disrupted alveolar growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Human fetal and neonatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> lungs contain ECFCs with robust prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ive potential, secondary colony formation on replating, and de novo blood vessel formation in vivo when transplanted into immunodeficient mice.

YAP-mediated mechanotransduction determines the podocyte’s response to damage
<p>Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells of the kidney filt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion barrier. They are subjected to physiological filt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion pressure and considerable mechanical strain, which can be further increased in various kidney diseases. When injury causes cytoskeletal reorganization and morphological alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ions of these cells, the filt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion barrier may become compromised and allow proteins to leak into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Using time-resolved proteomics, we showed that podocyte injury stimulated the activity of the transcriptional coactivator YAP and the expression of YAP target genes in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> model of glomerular disease before the development of proteinuria. Although the activities of YAP and its ortholog TAZ are activated by mechanical stress in most cell types, injury reduced YAP and TAZ activity in cultured human and mouse podocyte cell lines grown on stiff subst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>es. Culturing these cells on soft matrix or inhibiting stress fiber formation recapitulated the damage-induced YAP up-regulation observed in vivo, indicating a mechanotransduction-dependent mechanism of YAP activation in podocytes. YAP overexpression in cultured podocytes increased the abundance of extracellular matrix–related proteins that can contribute to fibrosis. YAP activity was increased in mouse models of diabetic nephropathy, and the YAP target <i>CTGF</i> was highly expressed in renal biopsies from glomerular disease patients. Although overexpression of human YAP in mice induced mild proteinuria, pharmacological inhibition of the interaction between YAP and its partner TEAD in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s amelio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed glomerular disease and reduced damage-induced mechanosignaling in the glomeruli.

An adipo-biliary-uridine axis that regulates energy homeostasis
<p>Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside present at high levels in the plasma of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rodent</span></strong>s and humans, is critical for RNA synthesis, glycogen deposition, and many other essential cellular processes. It also contributes to systemic metabolism, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We found that plasma uridine levels are regulated by fasting and refeeding in mice, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s, and humans. Fasting increases plasma uridine levels, and this increase relies largely on adipocytes. In contrast, refeeding reduces plasma uridine levels through biliary clearance. Elevation of plasma uridine is required for the drop in body tempe<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ure that occurs during fasting. Further, feeding-induced clearance of plasma uridine improves glucose metabolism. We also present findings that implicate leptin signaling in uridine homeostasis and consequent metabolic control and thermoregulation. Our results indicate that plasma uridine governs energy homeostasis and thermoregulation in a mechanism involving adipocyte-dependent uridine biosynthesis and leptin signaling.</p>

Novel Adipokine, FAM19A5, Inhibits Neointima Formation After Injury Through Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 2
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Obesity plays crucial roles in the development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanisms that link obesity and cardiovascular diseases remain elusive. Compelling evidence indicates that adipokines play an important role in obesity-related cardiovascular diseases. Here, we found a new adipokine-named family with sequence similarity 19, member A5 (FAM19A5), a protein with unknown function that was predicted to be distantly related to the CC-chemokine family. We aimed to test whether adipose-derived FAM19A5 regulates vascular pathology on injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>DNA cloning, protein expression, purification, and N-terminal sequencing were applied to characterize FAM19A5.

Balloon and wire injury were performed in vivo on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> carotid arteries and mouse femoral arteries, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis, radioactive ligand-receptor binding assays, receptor internalization, and calcium mobilization assays were used to identify the functional receptor for FAM19A5.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We first characterized FAM19A5 as a secreted protein, and the first 43 N-terminal amino acids were the signal peptides. Both FAM19A5 mRNA and protein were abundantly expressed in the adipose tissue but were downregulated in obese mice. Overexpression of FAM19A5 markedly inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion and mig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion and neointima formation in the carotid arteries of balloon-injured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s.

Adipose-specific FAM19A5 transgenic mice showed greater attenuation of neointima formation compared with wild-type littermates fed with or without Western-style diet. We further revealed that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 was the functional receptor for FAM19A5, with a dissociation constant (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) of 0.634 nmol/L.

Specific treatments for PAH exist, mostly targeting endothelial dysfunction, but high pulmonary arterial pressure still causes heart failure and death. Pulmonary vascular remodeling may be driven by metabolic reprogramming of vascular cells to increase glutaminolysis and glutamate production. The <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), a major neuronal glutamate receptor, is also expressed on vascular cells, but its role in PAH is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed the status of the glutamate-NMDAR axis in the pulmonary arteries of patients with PAH and controls through mass spectrometry imaging, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. We measured the glutamate release from cultured pulmonary vascular cells using enzymatic assays and analyzed NMDAR regulation/phosphorylation through Western blot experiments. The effect of NMDAR blockade on human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion was determined using a BrdU incorpo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion assay. We assessed the role of NMDARs in vascular remodeling associated to pulmonary hypertension, in both smooth muscle-specific NMDAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">knockout mic</span></strong>e exposed to chronic hypoxia and the monocrotaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> model of pulmonary hypertension using NMDAR blockers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We report glutamate accumulation, upregulation of the NMDAR, and NMDAR engagement reflected by increases in GluN1-subunit phosphorylation in the pulmonary arteries of human patients with PAH. K<sub>v</sub> channel inhibition and type A-selective endothelin receptor activation amplified calcium-dependent glutamate release from human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell, and type A-selective endothelin receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor activation led to NMDAR engagement, highlighting crosstalk between the glutamate-NMDAR axis and major PAH-associated pathways. The platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion of human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells involved NMDAR activation and phosphorylated GluN1 subunit localization to cell-cell contacts, consistent with glutamatergic communication between prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ing human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells via NMDARs. Smooth-muscle NMDAR deficiency in mice attenuated the vascular remodeling triggered by chronic hypoxia, highlighting the role of vascular NMDARs in pulmonary hypertension. Pharmacological NMDAR blockade in the monocrotaline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> model of pulmonary hypertension had beneficial effects on cardiac and vascular remodeling, decreasing endothelial dysfunction, cell prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion, and apoptosis resistance while disrupting the glutamate-NMDAR pathway in pulmonary arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results reveal a dysregulation of the glutamate-NMDAR axis in the pulmonary arteries of patients with PAH and identify vascular NMDARs as targets for antiremodeling treatments in PAH.</p></sec>

Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K Is Linked to Immunity and Inflammation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Immune dysregulation has been linked to occlusive vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is hereditary, idiopathic, or associated with other conditions. Circulating autoantibodies, lung perivascular lymphoid tissue, and elevated cytokines have been related to PAH pathogenesis but without a clear understanding of how these abnormalities are initiated, perpetuated, and connected in the progression of disease. We therefore set out to identify specific target antigens in PAH lung immune complexes as a starting point toward resolving these issues to better inform future application of immunomodulatory therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lung immune complexes were isolated and PAH target antigens were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and localized by confocal microscopy. One PAH antigen linked to immunity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion sequencing, functional studies in cultured monocytes and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and lung studies in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate immune factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in immune complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control lungs. Elevated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control lungs (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were elevated in PAH versus control lungs (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating monocytes, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an interleukin 6-independent manner. Furthermore, 3 weekly injections of HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced hemodynamic and vascular changes of pulmonary hypertension in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s (n=8) and elevated interleukin 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study reveals that upregulation of the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K could both initiate and sustain activation of the immune system and cause vascular changes associated with PAH.</p></sec>

Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 Inhibits Neointima Formation by Engaging Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying neointima formation remain unclear. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which are key innate immune regulators, play important roles in cardiometabolic diseases. However, the function of IRF4 in arterial restenosis is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>IRF4 expression was first detected in human and mouse restenotic arteries. Then, the effects of IRF4 on neointima formation were evaluated with universal IRF4-deficient mouse and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> carotid artery injury models. We performed immunostaining to identify IRF4-expressing cells in the lesions. Smooth muscle cell (SMC)–specific IRF4-knockout (KO) and -transgenic (TG) mice were gene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ed to evaluate the effects of SMC-IRF4 on neointima formation. We used microarray, bioinformatics analysis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to identify the downstream signals of IRF4 and to verify the targets in vitro. We compared SMC-IRF4-KO/Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)–TG mice with SMC-IRF4-KO mice and SMC-specific IRF4-TG/KLF4-KO mice with SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice to investigate whether the effect of IRF4 on neointima formation is KLF4-dependent. The effect of IRF4 on SMC phenotype switching was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>IRF4 expression in both the human and mouse restenotic arteries is eventually downregulated. Universal IRF4 ablation potentiates neointima formation in both mice and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s. Immunostaining indicated that IRF4 was expressed primarily in SMCs in restenotic arteries. After injury, SMC-IRF4-KO mice developed a thicker neointima than control mice. This change was accompanied by increased SMC prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion and mig<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion. However, SMC-specific IRF4-TG mice exhibited the opposite phenotype, demonst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ing that IRF4 exerts protective effects against neointima formation. The mechanistic study indicated that IRF4 promotes KLF4 expression by directly binding to its promoter. Genetic overexpression of KLF4 in SMCs largely reversed the neointima-promoting effect of IRF4 ablation, whereas ablation of KLF4 abolished the protective function of IRF4, indicating that the protective effects of IRF4 against neointima formation are KLF4-dependent. In addition, IRF4 promoted SMC dedifferentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>IRF4 protects arteries against neointima formation by promoting the expression of KLF4 by directly binding to its promoter. Our findings suggest that this previously undiscovered IRF4-KLF4 axis plays a key role in vasculoprolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ive pathology and may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arterial restenosis.</p></sec>

Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase-C Suppresses cAMP Formation in Human Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Chronic heart failure (HF) is associated with altered signal transduction via β-adrenoceptors and G proteins and with reduced cAMP formation. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are enriched at the plasma membrane of patients with end-stage HF, but the functional consequences of this are largely unknown, particularly for NDPK-C. Here, we investigated the potential role of NDPK-C in cardiac cAMP formation and contractility.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Real-time polymerase chain reaction, (far) Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry were used to study the expression, interaction with G proteins, and localization of NDPKs. cAMP levels were determined with immunoassays or fluorescent resonance energy transfer, and contractility was determined in cardiomyocytes (cell shortening) and in vivo (fractional shortening).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>NDPK-C was essential for the formation of an NDPK-B/G protein complex. Protein and mRNA levels of NDPK-C were upregulated in end-stage human HF, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>s after long-term isoprenaline stimulation through osmotic minipumps, and after incubation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> neonatal cardiomyocytes with isoprenaline. Isoprenaline also promoted translocation of NDPK-C to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of NDPK-C in cardiomyocytes increased cAMP levels and sensitized cardiomyocytes to isoprenaline-induced augmentation of contractility, whereas NDPK-C knockdown decreased cAMP levels. In vivo, depletion of NDPK-C in zebrafish embryos caused cardiac edema and ventricular dysfunction. NDPK-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">knockout mic</span></strong>e had unaltered NDPK-C expression but showed contractile dysfunction and exacerbated cardiac remodeling during long-term isoprenaline stimulation. In human end-stage HF, the complex formation between NDPK-C and Gα<sub>i2</sub> was increased whereas the NDPK-C/Gα<sub>s</sub> interaction was decreased, producing a switch that may contribute to an NDPK-C–dependent cAMP reduction in HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings identify NDPK-C as an essential requirement for both the interaction between NDPK isoforms and between NDPK isoforms and G proteins. NDPK-C is a novel critical regulator of β-adrenoceptor/cAMP signaling and cardiac contractility. By switching from Gα<sub>s</sub> to Gα<sub>i2</sub> activation, NDPK-C may contribute to lower cAMP levels and the related contractile dysfunction in HF.</p></sec>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Motor neurons and glia exhibit specific individualized responses to TDP-43 expression in a <i>Drosophila</i> model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by complex neuronal and glial phenotypes. Recently, RNA-based mechanisms have been linked to ALS via RNA-binding proteins such as TDP-43, which has been studied <i>in vivo</i> using models ranging from yeast to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rodent</span></strong>s. We have developed a <i>Drosophila</i> model of ALS based on TDP-43 that recapitulates several aspects of pathology, including motor neuron loss, locomotor dysfunction and reduced survival. Here we report the phenotypic consequences of expressing wild-type and four different ALS-linked TDP-43 mutations in neurons and glia. We show that TDP-43-driven neurodegene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion phenotypes are dose- and age-dependent. In motor neurons, TDP-43 appears restricted to nuclei, which are significantly misshapen due to mutant but not wild-type protein expression. In glia and in the developing neuroepithelium, TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic puncta. TDP-43-containing RNA granules are motile in cultured motor neurons, although wild-type and mutant variants exhibit different kinetic properties. At the neuromuscular junction, the expression of TDP-43 in motor neurons versus glia leads to seemingly opposite synaptic phenotypes that, surprisingly, translate into comparable locomotor defects. Finally, we explore sleep as a behavioral readout of TDP-43 expression and find evidence of sleep fragmentation consistent with hyperexcitability, a suggested mechanism in ALS. These findings support the notion that although motor neurons and glia are both involved in ALS pathology, at the cellular level they can exhibit different responses to TDP-43. In addition, our data suggest that individual TDP-43 alleles utilize distinct molecular mechanisms, which will be important for developing therapeutic st<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>egies.</p>

Nicotinamide Riboside Preserves Cardiac Function in a Mouse Model of Dilated Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial metabolic impairment is a major feature in chronic heart failure. As the major coenzyme in fuel oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation and a subst<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>e for enzymes signaling energy stress and oxidative stress response, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is emerging as a metabolic target in a number of diseases including heart failure. Little is known on the mechanisms regulating homeostasis of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the failing heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To explore possible alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ions of NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in the failing heart, we quantified the expression of NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzymes in the human failing heart and in the heart of a mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) triggered by Serum Response Factor transcription factor depletion in the heart (SRF<sup>HKO</sup>) or of cardiac hypertrophy triggered by transverse aorta constriction. We studied the impact of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor supplementation on cardiac function in both mouse models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed a 30% loss in levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the murine failing heart of both DCM and transverse aorta constriction mice that was accompanied by a decrease in expression of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme that recycles the nicotinamide precursor, whereas the nicotinamide riboside kinase 2 (NMRK2) that phosphorylates the nicotinamide riboside precursor is increased, to a higher level in the DCM (40-fold) than in transverse aorta constriction (4-fold). This shift was also observed in human failing heart biopsies in comparison with nonfailing controls. We show that the <i>Nmrk2</i> gene is an AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>or-activated receptor α responsive gene that is activated by energy stress and NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion in isolated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong> cardiomyocytes. Nicotinamide riboside efficiently rescues NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis in response to FK866-mediated inhibition of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and stimulates glycolysis in cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, we show that nicotinamide riboside supplementation in food attenuates the development of heart failure in mice, more robustly in DCM, and partially after transverse aorta constriction, by stabilizing myocardial NAD<sup>+</sup> levels in the failing heart. Nicotinamide riboside treatment also robustly increases the myocardial levels of 3 metabolites, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide, methylnicotinamide, and N1-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, that can be used as validation biomarkers for the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data show that nicotinamide riboside, the most energy-efficient among NAD precursors, could be useful for treatment of heart failure, notably in the context of DCM, a disease with few therapeutic options.</p></sec>

MicroRNA-195 Regulates Metabolism in Failing Myocardium Via Alterations in Sirtuin 3 Expression and Mitochondrial Protein Acetylation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities of the failing myocardium coupled with an energy-depleted state and cardiac remodeling. The mitochondrial deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of mitochondrial function through regulating the mitochondrial acetylome. It is interesting to note that unique cardiac and systemic microRNAs have been shown to play an important role in cardiac remodeling by modulating key signaling elements in the myocardium.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cellular signaling was analyzed in human cardiomyocyte-like AC16 cells, and acetylation levels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rodent</span></strong> models of SIRT3<sup>–/–</sup>and transgenic microRNA-195 (miR-195) overexpression were compared with wild type. Luciferase assays, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation assays, and echocardiographic analysis were performed. Enzymatic activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and ATP synthase were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In failing human myocardium, we observed induction of miR-195 along with decreased expression of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 that was associated with increased global protein acetylation. We further investigated the role of miR-195 in SIRT3-mediated metabolic processes and its impact on regulating enzymes involved in deacetylation. Proteomic analysis of the total acetylome showed increased overall acetylation, and specific lysine acetylation of 2 central mitochondrial metabolic enzymes, PDH and ATP synthase, as well. miR-195 downregulates SIRT3 expression through direct 3′-untranslated region targeting. Treatments with either sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide, small interfering RNA–mediated SIRT3 knockdown or miR-195 overexpression enhanced acetylation of PDH complex and ATP synthase. This effect diminished PDH and ATP synthase activity and impaired mitochondrial respi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rat</span></strong>ion.SIRT3<sup>–/–</sup> and miR-195 transgenic mice consistently showed enhanced global protein acetylation, including PDH complex and ATP synthase, associated with decreased enzymatic activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Altogether, these data suggest that increased levels of miR-195 in failing myocardium regulate a novel pathway that involves direct SIRT3 suppression and enzymatic inhibition via increased acetylation of PDH and ATP synthase that are essential for cardiac energy metabolism.</p></sec>

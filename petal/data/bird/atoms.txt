CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart disease is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV disease (MVD), the cellular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally deleted critical inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhes<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart disease valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es including arginase-1 and resistin-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 product<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of vascular cell adhes<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–1. Condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ally deleting the vascular cell adhes<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart disease. We define key inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that drive MVD in this model, including Syk, TNF, interleukin-6, very late antigen–4, and vascular cell adhes<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–1.</p></sec>

Probing and imaging spin interactions with a magnetic single-molecule sensor
<p>Magnetic single atoms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are receiving intensifying research focus because of their potential as the smallest possible memory, spintronic, and qubit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s. Scanning probe microscopes used to study these systems have benefited greatly from new techniques that use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e-funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>alized tips to enhance spatial and spectroscopic resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and enable new sensing capabilities. We demonstrate a microscopy technique that uses a magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e, Ni(cyclopentadienyl)<sub>2</sub>, adsorbed at the apex of a scanning probe tip, to sense exchange interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e adsorbed on a Ag(110) surface in a continuously tunable fash<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in all three spatial direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. We further used the probe to image contours of exchange interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> strength, revealing angstrom-scale reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s where the quantum states of two magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es strongly mix. Our results pave the way for new nanoscale imaging capabilities based on magnetic single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e sensors.</p>

Mid-term changes in blood metal ion levels after Articular Surface Replacement arthroplasty of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our first aim was to determine whether there are significant   changes in the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood at mid-term follow-up,   in patients with an Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) arthroplasty.   Secondly, we sought to identify risk factors for any increases.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 435 patients who underwent unilateral, metal-on-metal   (MoM) hip resurfacing (HRA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). These   patients all had one measurement of the level of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the   blood before seven years had passed post-operatively (early evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>)   and one after seven years had passed post-operatively (mid-term evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>).   Changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> levels were tested using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.   We identified subgroups at the highest risk of increase using a   multivariable linear logistic regress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were significant increases in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s   for patients who underwent both MoM HRA (Chromium (Cr): 0.5 parts   per bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (ppb); Cobalt (Co): 1.1 ppb) and MoM THA (Cr: 0.5 ppb;   Co: 0.7 ppb). In a multivariable model considering MoM HRAs, the   change in the levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s was influenced by female gender   (Co: Odds Ratio (OR) 1.42; p = 0.002 and Cr: OR 1.08; p = 0.006).   The change was found to be irrespective of the initial level for   the MoM HRAs, whereas there was a negative relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between   the initial level and the change in the level for those with a MoM   THA (Co: OR -0.43; p < 0.001 and Cr: OR -0.14; p = 0.033).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></title><p>The levels of metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the blood increase significantly   over the period until mid-term follow-up in patients with both a   MoM HRA and those with a MoM THA. We recommend that the levels of   metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s be measured most frequently for women with a MoM HRA.

Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> batteries are potential “next-generat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at high temperatures because suitable fluoride <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state.

A maternal-effect selfish genetic element in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong> is made up of <i>sup-35</i>, a maternal-effect toxin that kills developing embryos, and <i>pha-1</i>, its zygotically expressed antidote. <i>pha-1</i> has long been considered essential for pharynx development on the basis of its mutant phenotype, but this phenotype arises from a loss of suppress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>sup-35</i> toxicity. Inactive copies of the <i>sup-35/pha-1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong> show high sequence divergence from active copies, and phylogenetic reconstruct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggests that they represent ancestral stages in the evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>.

Risk factors for wear-related failures after hip resurfacing in patients with a low contact patch to rim distance
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A contact patch to rim (CPR) distance of < 10 mm has been   associated with edge-loading and excessive wear.

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of downstream signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Our single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e imaging analysis, we found that the diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration

We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of atomically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es while blocking solute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es to enable size-selective separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>.

An evolutionarily conserved gene family encodes proton-selective ion channels
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels form the basis for cellular electrical signaling. Despite the scores of genetically identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels selective for other monatomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, only one type of proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel has been found in eukaryotic cells. By comparative transcriptome analysis of mouse taste receptor cells, we identified Otopetrin1 (OTOP1), a protein required for development of gravity-sensing otoconia in the vestibular system, as forming a proton-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel. We found that murine OTOP1 is enriched in acid-detecting taste receptor cells and is required for their zinc-sensitive proton conductance. Two related murine genes, <i>Otop2</i> and <i>Otop3</i>, and a <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog also encode proton channels. Evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ary conservat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the gene family and its widespread tissue distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> suggest a broad role for proton channels in physiology and pathophysiology.</p>

<p>Copper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s exchanged into zeolites are active for the selective catalytic reduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (SCR) of nitrogen oxides (NO<i><sub>x</sub></i>) with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but the low-temperature rate dependence on copper (Cu) volumetric density is inconsistent with react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> at single sites. We combine steady-state and transient kinetic measurements, x-ray absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> spectroscopy, and first-principles calculat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to demonstrate that under react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, mobilized Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s can travel through zeolite windows and form transient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pairs that participate in an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)–mediated Cu<sup>I</sup>→Cu<sup>II</sup> redox step integral to SCR. Electrostatic tethering to framework aluminum centers limits the volume that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> can explore and thus its capacity to form an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pair. The dynamic, reversible format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of multinuclear sites from mobilized single atoms represents a distinct phenomenon that falls outside the convent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al boundaries of a heterogeneous or homogeneous catalyst.</p>

Transcription Factors VND1-VND3 Contribute to Cotyledon Xylem Vessel Formation
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN1</i> (<i>VND1</i>) to <i>VND7</i> encode a group of NAC domain transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factors that funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> as master regulators of xylem vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong> differentiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. These transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factors activate the transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of genes required for secondary cell wall format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and programmed cell death, key events in xylem vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong> differentiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Because constitutive overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of VND6 and VND7 induces ectopic xylem vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong> differentiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al studies of VND proteins have largely focused on these two proteins. Here, we report the roles of VND1, VND2, and VND3 in xylem vessel format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in cotyledons. Using our newly established in vitro system in which excised Arabidopsis cotyledons are stimulated to undergo xylem cell differentiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> by cytokinin, auxin, and brassinosteroid treatment, we found that ectopic xylem vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong> differentiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> required VND1, VND2, and VND3 but not VND6 or VND7. The importance of VND1, VND2, and VND3 also was indicated in vivo; in the <i>vnd1 vnd2 vnd3</i> seedlings, xylem vessel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong> differentiat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of secondary veins in cotyledons was inhibited under dark condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Furthermore, the light responsiveness of <i>VND</i> gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was disturbed in the <i>vnd1 vnd2 vnd3</i> mutant, and <i>vnd1 vnd2 vnd3</i> failed to recover lateral root development in response to the change of light condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. These findings suggest that VND1 to VND3 have specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, possibly linking light condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s to xylem vessel format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, during seedling development.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a biological system with small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es to specifically perturb cellular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s is commonly referred to as chemical biology. Small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e effectors of various cellular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es identified in screens designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain valuable informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> about natural select<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, but this informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s such as transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>elect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural select<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> on such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and divergence in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> from many short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s in a manner that accounts for variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> among loci in mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of weak negative, strong negative, and positive select<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and divergence. It obtains informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> about divergence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> maximizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> algorithm. Using simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and divergence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.</p>

The ion channel TRPM7 is required for B cell lymphopoiesis
<p>The transient receptor potential (TRP) family is a large family of widely expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels that regulate the intracellular concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and metals and respond to various chemical and physical stimuli. TRP subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) is unusual in that it contains both an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 is a divalent cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel with preference for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. It is required for the survival of DT40 cells, a B cell line; however, delet<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 in T cells does not impair their development. We found that express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of TRPM7 was required for B cell development in mice. Mice that lacked TRPM7 in B cells failed to generate peripheral B cells because of a developmental block at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of TRPM7 kinase activity alone did not affect the proport<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of peripheral mature B cells or the development of B cells in the bone marrow. However, supplementat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> with a high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> partially rescued the development of TRPM7-deficient B cells in vitro. Thus, our findings identify a critical role for TRPM7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channel activity in B cell development.</p>

Electrofluorochromism at the single-molecule level
<p>The interplay between the oxidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> state and the optical properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es is important for applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in displays, sensors, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar-based memories. The fundamental mechanisms occurring at the level of a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e have been difficult to probe. We used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to characterize and control the fluorescence of a single zinc-phthalocyanine radical cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> adsorbed on a sodium chloride–covered gold (111) sample. The neutral and oxidized states of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e were identified on the basis of their fluorescence spectra, which revealed very different emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> energies and vibronic fingerprints. The emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the charged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e was controlled by tuning the thickness of the insulator and the plasmons localized at the apex of the STM tip. In addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, subnanometric variat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the tip posit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> were used to investigate the charging and electroluminescence mechanisms.</p>

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms
<p>Chemical react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s typically proceed via stochastic encounters between reactants. Going beyond this paradigm, we combined exactly two atoms in a single, controlled react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. The experimental apparatus traps two individual laser-cooled atoms [one sodium (Na) and one cesium (Cs)] in separate optical tweezers and then merges them into one optical dipole trap. Subsequently, photoassociat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> forms an excited-state NaCs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e.

Detection of the aromatic molecule benzonitrile (<i>c</i>-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CN) in the interstellar medium
<p>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic nitrogen heterocycles are thought to be widespread throughout the universe, because these classes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are probably responsible for the unidentified infrared bands, a set of emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> features seen in numerous Galactic and extragalactic sources. Despite their expected ubiquity, astronomical identificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of specific aromatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es has proven elusive.

Synthetic transcription elongation factors license transcription across repressive chromatin
<p>The release of paused RNA polymerase II into productive elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is highly regulated, especially at genes that affect human development and disease. To exert control over this rate-limiting step, we designed sequence-specific synthetic transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factors (Syn-TEFs). These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are composed of programmable DNA-binding ligands flexibly tethered to a small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e that engages the transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> elongat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> machinery. By limiting activity to targeted loci, Syn-TEFs convert constituent modules from broad-spectrum inhibitors of transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> into gene-specific stimulators. Here we present Syn-TEF1, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e that actively enables transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> across repressive GAA repeats that silence frataxin express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in Friedreich’s ataxia, a terminal neurodegenerative disease with no effective therapy.

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits
<p>In the field of nanofluidics, it has been an ultimate but seemingly distant goal to controllably fabricate capillaries with dimens<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s approaching the size of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es. We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> transport through ultimately narrow slits that are fabricated by effectively removing a single atomic plane from a bulk crystal. The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the role of steric effects. We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with hydrated diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between an<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s and cat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the same diameter. Our results provide a platform for studying the effects of angstrom-scale confinement, which is important for the development of nanofluidics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar separat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and other nanoscale technologies.</p>

Single-cell methylomes identify neuronal subtypes and regulatory elements in mammalian cortex
<p>The mammalian brain contains diverse neuronal types, yet we lack single-cell epigenomic assays that are able to identify and characterize them. DNA methylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is a stable epigenetic mark that distinguishes cell types and marks regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s. We generated >6000 methylomes from single neuronal nuclei and used them to identify 16 mouse and 21 human neuronal subpopulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the frontal cortex. CG and non-CG methylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> exhibited cell type–specific distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, and we identified regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s with differential methylat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> across neuron types.

Quantum and isotope effects in lithium metal

For decades it has been believed that lithium, the simplest metallic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>, has a complicated ground-state crystal structure. Using synchrotron x-ray diffract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in diamond anvil cells and multiscale simulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s with density funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al theory and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar dynamics, we show that the previously accepted martensitic ground state is metastable.

We find that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>es of lithium, under similar thermal paths, exhibit a considerable difference in martensitic transit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> temperature. Lithium exhibits nuclear quantum mechanical effects, serving as a metallic intermediate between helium, with its quantum effect–dominated structures, and the higher-mass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s.

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals

Because other iron-transport proteins remain active, labile iron gradients build up across the corresponding protein-deficient membranes. Here we report that a small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e natural product, hinokitiol, can harness such gradients to restore iron transport into, within, and/or out of cells. The same compound promotes gut iron absorpt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in DMT1-deficient rats and ferroportin-deficient mice, as well as hemoglobinizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in DMT1- and mitoferrin-deficient zebrafish.

Predicting human olfactory perception from chemical features of odor molecules

We therefore organized the crowd-sourced DREAM Olfact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Predict<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Challenge. Using a large olfactory psychophysical data set, teams developed machine-learning algorithms to predict sensory attributes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es based on their chemoinformatic features. The resulting models accurately predicted odor intensity and pleasantness and also successfully predicted 8 among 19 rated semantic descriptors (“garlic,” “fish,” “sweet,” “fruit,” “burnt,” “spices,” “flower,” and “sour”). Regularized linear models performed nearly as well as random forest–based ones, with a predictive accuracy that closely approaches a key theoretical limit. These models help to predict the perceptual qualities of virtually any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e with high accuracy and also reverse-engineer the smell of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire

Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different act<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s on their neuron targets, including directly opening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> channels or acting through signal transduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s on transpirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e composit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fract<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpirat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> but also by photosynthetic react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, probably as a consequence of NADPH format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e can be used to assess plant performance under different growing condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

An Efficient System for <i>Ds</i> Transposon Tagging in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Transposon tagging is a powerful tool that has been widely applied in several species for insert<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al mutagenesis in plants. Several efforts have aimed to create transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insert<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al mutant populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot plant used as a model system to study temperate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at using transposon strategies. Here, we describe the applicat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong></i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging system in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong> were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> plants. The <i>Ds</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong> was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synapsis, recombinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, and segregat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, the <i>Ds</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong> separated from the <i>Ac</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only plants using G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> lines, some of which were highly efficient at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only plants. Furthermore, we identified a large collect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of mutants with visible developmental phenotypes via this transposon tagging system. The system is relatively simple and rapid in comparison to tradit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al T-DNA insert<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> strategies, because once efficiency lines are obtained they can be reused to generate more lines from nontransposed plants without the use of time-consuming tissue culture steps.</p>

Transcription Factors PvERF15 and PvMTF-1 Form a Cadmium Stress Transcriptional Pathway
<p>In plants, cadmium (Cd)-responsive transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> factors are key downstream effectors of Cd stress transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al pathways, which are capable of converging Cd stress signals through triggering the express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of Cd detoxificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> genes. However, the upstream transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulatory pathways that modulate their responses to Cd are less clear. Previously, we identified the bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) METAL RESPONSE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>-BINDING TRANSCRIPT<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> FACTOR1 (PvMTF-1) that responds to Cd and confers Cd tolerance in planta. Here, we demonstrate an upstream transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <i>PvMTF-1</i> response to Cd. Using a yeast one-hybrid system, we cloned the bean ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR15 (PvERF15) that binds to the <i>PvMTF-1</i> promoter. <i>PvERF15</i> was strongly induced by Cd stress, and its overexpress<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> resulted in the up-regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>PvMTF-1</i>. DNA-protein interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> assays further revealed that PvERF15 binds directly to a 19-bp AC-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong> in the <i>PvMTF-1</i> promoter. The AC-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong> serves as a positive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong> bound by PvERF15 to activate gene express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. More importantly, knockdown of <i>PvERF15</i> by RNA interference resulted in reduced Cd-induced express<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <i>PvMTF-1</i>. <i>PvERF15</i> seems to be involved in Cd tolerance, since knockdown of <i>PvERF15</i> by RNA interference in bean leaf discs decreased Cd tolerance in a transient assay. Since PvERF15 is a component of the Cd stress transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al pathway in beans and <i>PvMTF-1</i> is one of its downstream targets, our findings provide a PvERF15/PvMTF-1 transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al pathway and thereby contribute to the understanding of Cd stress transcript<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al regulatory pathways in plants.</p>

Structure-Activity Relation of AMOR Sugar Molecule That Activates Pollen-Tubes for Ovular Guidance
<p>Successful fertilizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in flowering plants depends on the precise direct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al growth control of pollen tube through the female pistil tissue toward the female gametophyte contained in the ovule for delivery of nonmotile sperm cells. Cys-rich peptides LUREs secreted from the synergid cells on either side of the egg cell act as ovular attractants of pollen tubes. Competency control by the pistil is crucial for the response of pollen tubes to these ovular attractants. We recently reported that ovular 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl arabinogalactan (AMOR) induces competency of the pollen tube to respond to ovular attractant LURE peptides in <i>Torenia fournieri.</i> The beta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>er of the terminal disaccharide 4-<i>O</i>-methyl-glucuronosyl galactose was essential and sufficient for the competency induct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. However, critical and noncritical structures in the disaccharide have not been dissected deeply. Herein, we report the synthesis of new AMOR analogs and the structure-activity relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ships for AMOR activity in the presence of these synthesized analogs. Removal of 4-<i>O</i>-methyl group or –COOH from the glucuronosyl residue of the disaccharide dramatically reduces AMOR activity. The pyranose backbone of the second sugar of disaccharide is essential for the activity but not hydroxy groups. The role of beta <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isom</span></strong>er of the disaccharide 4-Me-GlcA-β(1,6)-Gal is very specific for competency control, as there was no difference in effect among the sugar analogs tested for pollen germinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. This study represents the first structure-activity relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship study, to our knowledge, of a sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e involved in plant reproduct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, which opens a way for modificat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e without loss of activity.</p>

Rapid cold hardening improves recovery of ion homeostasis and chill coma recovery time in the migratory locust, <i>Locusta migratoria</i>
<p>Chill tolerance of insects is defined as the ability to tolerate low temperature under circumstances not involving freezing of intracellular or extracellular fluids. For many insects chill tolerance is crucial for their ability to persist in cold environments and mounting evidence indicates that chill tolerance is associated with the ability to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and water homeostasis, thereby ensuring muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and preventing chill injury at low temperature. The present study describes the relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship between muscle and haemolymph <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis and time to regain posture following cold shock (CS, 2 h at −4°C) in the chill-susceptible locust <i>Locusta migratoria</i>. This relat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>ship was examined in animals with and without a prior rapid cold-hardening treatment (RCH, 2 h at 0°C) to investigate the physiological underpinnings of RCH. CS elicited a doubling of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>] and this disturbance was greater in locusts pre-exposed to RCH. Recovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis was, however, markedly faster in RCH-treated animals, which correlated well with whole-organism performance as hardened individuals regained posture faster than non-hardened individuals following CS. The present study indicates that loss and recovery of muscular funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> are associated with the resting membrane potential of excitable membranes as attested by the changes in the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup> (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>) following CS. Both hardened and non-hardened animals regained movement once K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis had recovered to a fixed level (<i>E</i><sub>K</sub>≈−41 mV). RCH is therefore not associated with altered sensitivity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> disturbance but instead is correlated to a faster recovery of haemolymph [K<sup>+</sup>].</p>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or funct<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>al change in glomerular filtrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimizat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> Strategies Evaluat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients.

Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the populat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22).

Spindle asymmetry drives non-Mendelian chromosome segregation
<p>Genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s compete for transmiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> through meiosis, when haploid gametes are created from a diploid parent. Selfish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s can enhance their transmiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> through a process known as meiotic drive. In female meiosis, selfish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s drive by preferentially attaching to the egg side of the spindle. This implies some asymmetry between the two sides of the spindle, but the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar mechanisms underlying spindle asymmetry are unknown. Here we found that CDC42 signaling from the cell cortex regulated microtubule tyrosinat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to induce spindle asymmetry and that non-Mendelian segregat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> depended on this asymmetry.

Remobilization of crustal carbon may dominate volcanic arc emissions

Poisons, antidotes, and selfish genes
<p>Selfish genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s are parasitic replicators that are specialists in ensuring their own transmiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> despite conferring no benefit, or even exacting a cost, on their bearers. They come in many flavors, such as transposable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s, segregat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> distorters, female meiotic drivers, and so-called B chromosomes (or accessory chromosomes) (<i>1</i>). Such selfish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">element</span></strong>s provide the strongest support for the gene-centric view of evolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>, as popularized by Richard Dawkins in <i>The Selfish Gene</i> (<i>2</i>). On page 1051 of this issue, Ben-David <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) chase down a serendipitous observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of an anomaly in genetic crosses to unmask a toxin-antidote type of selfish system in worms.</p>

ATP as a biological hydrotrope
<p>Hydrotropes are small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that solubilize hydrophobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in aqueous solut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es and differ from classical surfactants in that they have low cooperativity of aggregat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> and work at molar concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s. Here, we show that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has properties of a biological hydrotrope. It can both prevent the format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of and dissolve previously formed protein aggregates. This chemical property is manifested at physiological concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between 5 and 10 millimolar. Therefore, in addit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> to being an energy source for biological react<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s, for which micromolar concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s are sufficient, we propose that millimolar concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s of ATP may act to keep proteins soluble. This may in part explain why ATP is maintained in such high concentrat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in cells.</p>

Tungsten-182 heterogeneity in modern ocean island basalts
<p>New tungsten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e data for modern ocean island basalts (OIB) from Hawaii, Samoa, and Iceland reveal variable <sup>182</sup>W/<sup>184</sup>W, ranging from that of the ambient upper mantle to ratios as much as 18 parts per mill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> lower. The tungsten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic data negatively correlate with <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He. These data indicate that each OIB system accesses domains within Earth that formed within the first 60 mill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> years of solar system history. Combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic and chemical characteristics projected for these ancient domains indicate that they contain metal and are repositories of noble gases. We suggest that the most likely source candidates are mega–ultralow-velocity zones, which lie beneath Hawaii, Samoa, and Iceland but not beneath hot spots whose OIB yield normal <sup>182</sup>W and homogeneously low <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He.</p>

Reversion of antibiotic resistance in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> by spiroisoxazoline SMARt-420
<p>Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to human health globally. Alarmingly, multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> have now spread worldwide. Some key antituberculosis antibiotics are prodrugs, for which resistance mechanisms are mainly driven by mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s in the bacterial enzymatic pathway required for their bioactivat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>. We have developed drug-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that activate a cryptic alternative bioactivat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathway of eth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>amide in <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, circumventing the classic activat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> pathway in which resistance mutat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s have now been observed. The first-of-its-kind <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e, named SMARt-420 (Small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e Aborting Resistance), not only fully reverses eth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>amide-acquired resistance and clears eth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>amide-resistant infect<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in mice, it also increases the basal sensitivity of bacteria to eth<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>amide.</p>

A peptide hormone required for Casparian strip diffusion barrier formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots
<p>Plants achieve mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis by means of a hydrophobic barrier on endodermal cells called the Casparian strip, which restricts lateral diffus<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s between the root vascular bundles and the soil. We identified a family of sulfated peptides required for contiguous Casparian strip format<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> roots. These peptide hormones, which we named Casparian strip integrity factor 1 (CIF1) and CIF2, are expressed in the root stele and specifically bind the endodermis-expressed leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase GASSHO1 (GSO1)/SCHENGEN3 and its homolog, GSO2. A mutant devoid of CIF peptides is defective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> homeostasis in the xylem. <i>CIF</i> genes are environmentally responsive. Casparian strip regulat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong> is not merely a passive process driven by root developmental cues; it also serves as an active strategy to cope with adverse soil condit<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ion</span></strong>s.</p>

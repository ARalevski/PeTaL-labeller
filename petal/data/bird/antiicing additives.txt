A unique type of GSK-3 inhibitor brings new opportunities to the clinic
<p>Development of protein kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s is a focus of many drug discovery programs. A major problem, however, is the limited specificity of the commonly used adenosine triphosphate–competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s and the weak inhibition of the more selective substrate-competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Glycogen synthase kinase–3 (GSK-3) is a promising drug target for treating neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but most GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have not reached the clinic. We describe a new type of GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>, L807mts, that acts through a substrate-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> conversion mechanism that occurs within the catalytic site of the enzyme. We determined that L807mts was a potent and highly selective GSK-3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> with reasonable pharmacological and safety properties when tested in rodents. Treatment with L807mts enhanced the clearance of β-amyloid loads, reduced inflammation, enhanced autophagic flux, and improved cognitive and social skills in the 5XFAD AD mouse model. This new modality of GSK-3 inhibition may be therapeutic in patients with AD or other central nervous system disorders associated with dysregulated GSK-3.</p>

Androgen receptor inhibitor–induced “BRCAness” and PARP inhibition are synthetically lethal for castration-resistant prostate cancer
<p>Cancers with loss-of-function mutations in <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> are deficient in the DNA damage repair pathway called homologous recombination (HR), rendering these cancers exquisitely vulnerable to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. This functional state and therapeutic sensitivity is referred to as “BRCAness” and is most commonly associated with some breast cancer types. Pharmaceutical induction of BRCAness could expand the use of PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s to other tumor types. For example, <i>BRCA</i> mutations are present in only ~20% of prostate cancer patients. We found that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells showed increased expression of a set of HR-associated genes, including <i>BRCA1</i>, <i>RAD54L</i>, and <i>RMI2</i>. Although androgen-targeted therapy is typically not effective in CRPC patients, the androgen receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> enzalutamide suppressed the expression of those HR genes in CRPC cells, thus creating HR deficiency and BRCAness. A “lead-in” treatment strategy, in which enzalutamide was followed by the PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> olaparib, promoted DNA damage–induced cell death and inhibited clonal proliferation of prostate cancer cells in culture and suppressed the growth of prostate cancer xenografts in mice. Thus, antiandrogen and PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> combination therapy may be effective for CRPC patients and suggests that pharmaceutically inducing BRCAness may expand the clinical use of PARP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s.</p>

Targeting NOTCH activation in small cell lung cancer through LSD1 inhibition
<p>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recalcitrant, aggressive neuroendocrine-type cancer for which little change to first-line standard-of-care treatment has occurred within the last few decades. Unlike nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SCLC harbors few actionable mutations for therapeutic intervention. Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1 also known as KDM1A) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s were previously shown to have selective activity in SCLC models, but the underlying mechanism was elusive. Here, we found that exposure to the selective LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> ORY-1001 activated the NOTCH pathway, resulting in the suppression of the transcription factor ASCL1 and the repression of SCLC tumorigenesis. Our analyses revealed that LSD1 bound to the <i>NOTCH1</i> locus, thereby suppressing NOTCH1 expression and downstream signaling. Reactivation of NOTCH signaling with the LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> reduced the expression of ASCL1 and neuroendocrine cell lineage genes. Knockdown studies confirmed the pharmacological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>-based results. In vivo, sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition in SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models correlated with the extent of consequential NOTCH pathway activation and repression of a neuroendocrine phenotype. Complete and durable tumor regression occurred with ORY-1001–induced NOTCH activation in a chemoresistant PDX model. Our findings reveal how LSD1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s function in this tumor and support their potential as a new and targeted therapy for SCLC.</p>

Skp2-dependent reactivation of AKT drives resistance to PI3K inhibitors
<p>The PI3K-AKT kinase signaling pathway is frequently deregulated in human cancers, particularly breast cancer, where amplification and somatic mutations of <i>PIK3CA</i> occur with high frequency in patients. Numerous small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s targeting both PI3K and AKT are under clinical evaluation, but dose-limiting toxicities and the emergence of resistance limit therapeutic efficacy. Various resistance mechanisms to PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have been identified, including de novo mutations, feedback activation of AKT, or cross-talk pathways. We found a previously unknown resistance mechanism to PI3K pathway inhibition that results in AKT rebound activation. In a subset of triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, treatment with a PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> or depletion of <i>PIK3CA</i> expression ultimately promoted AKT reactivation in a manner dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp2, the kinases IGF-1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1), and the cell growth and metabolism-regulating complex mTORC2 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2), but was independent of PI3K activity or PIP<sub>3</sub> production. Resistance to PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s correlated with the increased abundance of Skp2, ubiquitylation of AKT, cell proliferation in culture, and xenograft tumor growth in mice. These findings reveal a ubiquitin signaling feedback mechanism by which PI3K <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> resistance may emerge in aggressive breast cancer cells.</p>

Developmental phosphoproteomics identifies the kinase CK2 as a driver of Hedgehog signaling and a therapeutic target in medulloblastoma
<p>A major limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of drug resistance, which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the drug target or through intrinsic resistance of subpopulations of tumor cells. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain tumor, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and drug-resistant. To find new drug targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to common resistance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins commonly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB tumors that were resistant to currently available Hh <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, thereby extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this drug may avoid at least one common mode of acquired resistance. These findings suggest that CK2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.</p>

Inflammatory but not mitogenic contexts prime synovial fibroblasts for compensatory signaling responses to p38 inhibition
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that causes joint pain, swelling, and loss of function. Development of effective new drugs has proven challenging in part because of the complexities and interconnected nature of intracellular signaling networks that complicate the effects of pharmacological interventions. We characterized the kinase signaling pathways that are activated in RA and evaluated the multivariate effects of targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Synovial fluids from RA patients activated the kinase signaling pathways JAK, JNK, p38, and MEK in synovial fibroblasts (SFs), a stromal cell type that promotes RA progression. Kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s enhanced signaling of “off-target” pathways in a manner dependent on stimulatory context. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of p38, which have been widely explored in clinical trials for RA, resulted in undesirable increases in nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), JNK, and MEK signaling in SFs in inflammatory, but not mitogenic, contexts. This was mediated by the transcription factor CREB, which functions in part within a negative feedback loop in MAPK signaling. CREB activation was induced predominately by p38 in response to inflammatory stimuli, but by MEK in response to mitogenic stimuli; hence, the effects of drugs targeting p38 or MEK were markedly different in SFs cultured under mitogenic or inflammatory conditions. Together, these findings illustrate how stimulatory context can alter dominance in pathway cross-talk even for a fixed network topology, thereby providing a rationale for why p38 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s deliver limited benefits in RA and demonstrating the need for careful consideration of p38-targeted drugs in inflammation-related disorders.</p>

MEK inhibitor trametinib does not prevent the growth of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)–addicted neuroblastomas
<p>Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is implicated in driving the initiation and progression of multiple cancers. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s targeting the RAS-MAPK pathway are clinically approved as single- or polyagent therapies for patients with specific types of cancer. One example is the MEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> trametinib, which is included as a rational polytherapy strategy for treating EML4-ALK–positive, EGFR-activated, or KRAS-mutant lung cancers and neuroblastomas that also contain activating mutations in the RAS-MAPK pathway. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, in neuroblastoma, a heterogeneous disease, relapse cases display an increased rate of mutations in <i>ALK</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, and <i>NF1</i>, leading to increased activation of RAS-MAPK signaling. Co-targeting ALK and the RAS-MAPK pathway is an attractive option, because monotherapies have not yet produced effective results in ALK-addicted neuroblastoma patients. We evaluated the response of neuroblastoma cell lines to MEK-ERK pathway inhibition by trametinib. In contrast to RAS-MAPK pathway-mutated neuroblastoma cell lines, ALK-addicted neuroblastoma cells treated with trametinib showed increased activation (inferred by phosphorylation) of the kinases AKT and ERK5. This feedback response was mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2–associated protein SIN1, resulting in increased survival and proliferation that depended on AKT signaling. In xenografts in mice, trametinib inhibited the growth of EML4-ALK–positive non–small cell lung cancer and RAS-mutant neuroblastoma but not ALK-addicted neuroblastoma. Thus, our results advise against the seemingly rational option of using MEK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s to treat ALK-addicted neuroblastoma.</p>

Differential abundance of CK1α provides selectivity for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-dependent tumors
<p>Constitutive WNT activity drives the growth of various human tumors, including nearly all colorectal cancers (CRCs). Despite this prominence in cancer, no WNT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> is currently approved for use in the clinic largely due to the small number of druggable signaling components in the WNT pathway and the substantial toxicity to normal gastrointestinal tissue. We have shown that pyrvinium, which activates casein kinase 1α (CK1α), is a potent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> of WNT signaling. However, its poor bioavailability limited the ability to test this first-in-class WNT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> in vivo. We characterized a novel small-molecule CK1α activator called SSTC3, which has better pharmacokinetic properties than pyrvinium, and found that it inhibited the growth of CRC xenografts in mice. SSTC3 also attenuated the growth of a patient-derived metastatic CRC xenograft, for which few therapies exist. SSTC3 exhibited minimal gastrointestinal toxicity compared to other classes of WNT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Consistent with this observation, we showed that the abundance of the SSTC3 target, CK1α, was decreased in WNT-driven tumors relative to normal gastrointestinal tissue, and knocking down CK1α increased cellular sensitivity to SSTC3. Thus, we propose that distinct CK1α abundance provides an enhanced therapeutic index for pharmacological CK1α activators to target WNT-driven tumors.</p>

Identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of type 1 adenylyl cyclase activity with analgesic properties
<p>Adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) belongs to a group of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) that are stimulated by calcium in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Studies with AC1 knockout mice suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of AC1 may be useful for treating pain and opioid dependence. However, nonselective inhibition of AC isoforms could result in substantial adverse effects. We used chemical library screening to identify a selective AC1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> with a chromone core structure that may represent a new analgesic agent. After demonstrating that the compound (ST034307) inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably transfected with AC1 (HEK-AC1 cells), we confirmed selectivity for AC1 by testing against all isoforms of membrane-bound ACs. ST034307 also inhibited AC1 activity stimulated by forskolin- and Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors in HEK-AC1 cells and showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>y activity in multiple AC1-containing membrane preparations and mouse hippocampal homogenates. ST034307 enhanced μ-opioid receptor (MOR)–mediated inhibition of AC1 in short-term inhibition assays in HEK-AC1 cells stably transfected with MOR; however, the compound blocked heterologous sensitization of AC1 caused by chronic MOR activation in these cells. ST034307 reduced pain responses in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. Our data indicate that ST034307 is a selective small-molecule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> of AC1 and suggest that selective AC1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s may be useful for managing pain.</p>

Activity-based protein profiling reveals off-target proteins of the FAAH inhibitor BIA 10-2474
<p>A recent phase 1 trial of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> BIA 10-2474 led to the death of one volunteer and produced mild-to-severe neurological symptoms in four others. Although the cause of the clinical neurotoxicity is unknown, it has been postulated, given the clinical safety profile of other tested FAAH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, that off-target activities of BIA 10-2474 may have played a role.

BIA 10-2474, but not PF04457845, produced substantial alterations in lipid networks in human cortical neurons, suggesting that promiscuous lipase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have the potential to cause metabolic dysregulation in the nervous system.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Inhibits Auxin-Induced Lateral Rooting Independently of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 Receptor
<p>Plant root systems are indispensable for water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and anchoring plants in the soil. Previous studies using auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s definitively established that auxin plays a central role regulating root growth and development. Most auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s affect all auxin signaling at the same time, which obscures an understanding of individual events. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a lateral root (LR)-preferential auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in a manner that is independent of the JA receptor, CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1). Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with either (−)-JA or (+)-JA reduced primary root length and LR number; the reduction of LR number was also observed in <i>coi1</i> mutants. Treatment of seedlings with (−)-JA or (+)-JA suppressed auxin-inducible genes related to LR formation, diminished accumulation of the auxin reporter <i>DR5::GUS</i>, and inhibited auxin-dependent DII-VENUS degradation. A structural mimic of (−)-JA and (+)-coronafacic acid also inhibited LR formation and stabilized DII-VENUS protein. COI1-independent activity was retained in the double mutant of <i>transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> response1</i> and <i>auxin signaling f-box protein2</i> (<i>tir1 afb2</i>) but reduced in the <i>afb5</i> single mutant. These results reveal JAs and (+)-coronafacic acid to be selective counter-auxins, a finding that could lead to new approaches for studying the mechanisms of LR formation.</p>

Functional Analysis of Short Linear Motifs in the Plant Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor SIAMESE
<p>Endoreplication, a modified cell cycle in which DNA is replicated without subsequent cell division, plays an important but poorly understood role in plant growth and in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SIAMESE</i> (<i>SIM</i>) gene encodes the first identified member of the SIAMESE-RELATED (SMR) family of cyclin-dependent kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. <i>SIM</i> controls endoreplication during trichome development, and <i>sim</i> mutant trichomes divide several times instead of endoreplicating their DNA. The SMR family is defined by several short linear amino acid sequence motifs of largely unknown function, and family members have little sequence similarity to any known protein functional domains. Here, we investigated the roles of the conserved motifs in <i>SIM</i> site-directed Arabidopsis mutants using several functional assays. We identified a potential cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-binding site, which bears no resemblance to other known CDK interaction motifs. We also identified a potential site of phosphorylation and two redundant nuclear localization sequences. Surprisingly, the only motif with similarity to the other family of plant CDK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>/INTERACTOR OF CDC2 KINASE/KIP-RELATED PROTEIN proteins, is not required for <i>SIM</i> function in vivo. Because even highly divergent members of the <i>SMR</i> family are able to replace <i>SIM</i> function in Arabidopsis trichomes, it is likely that the results obtained here for <i>SIM</i> will apply to other members of this plant-specific family of CDK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s.</p>

Extracellular ATP Acts on Jasmonate Signaling to Reinforce Plant Defense
<p>Damaged cells send various signals to stimulate defense responses. Recent identification and genetic studies of the plant purinoceptor, P2K1 (also known as DORN1), have demonstrated that extracellular ATP is a signal involved in plant stress responses, including wounding, perhaps to evoke plant defense. However, it remains largely unknown how extracellular ATP induces plant defense responses. Here, we demonstrate that extracellular ATP induces plant defense mediated through activation of the intracellular signaling of jasmonate (JA), a well-characterized defense hormone. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves, ATP pretreatment induced resistance against the necrotrophic fungus, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The induced resistance was enhanced in the P2K1 receptor overexpression line, but reduced in the receptor mutant, <i>dorn1</i>-<i>3</i>. Mining the transcriptome data revealed that ATP induces a set of JA-induced genes. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the P2K1-associated coexpression network contains defense-related genes, including those encoding jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins, which play key roles as repressors of JA signaling. We examined whether extracellular ATP impacts the stability of JAZ1 in Arabidopsis. The results showed that the JAZ1 stability decreased in response to ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion in a proteasome-dependent manner. This reduction required intracellular signaling via second messengers—cytosolic calcium, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide. Interestingly, the ATP-induced JAZ1 degradation was attenuated in the JA receptor mutant, <i>coi1</i>, but not in the JA biosynthesis mutant, <i>aos</i>, or upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of JA biosynthesis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ATP increases the interaction between COI1 and JAZ1, suggesting direct cross talk between extracellular ATP and JA in intracellular signaling events. Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular ATP signaling directly impacts the JA signaling pathway to maximize plant defense responses.</p>

Mode of action of a <i>Drosophila</i> FMRFamide in inducing muscle contraction
<p><i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is a model system for examining the mechanisms of action of neuropeptides. DPKQDFMRFamide was previously shown to induce contractions in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscle fibres in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. The present study examined the possible involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor and second messengers in mediating this myotropic effect after removal of the central nervous system. DPKQDFMRFamide-induced contractions were reduced by 70% and 90%, respectively, in larvae with reduced expression of the <i>Drosophila Fmrf</i> receptor (FR) either ubiquitously or specifically in muscle tissue, compared with the response in control larvae in which expression was not manipulated. No such effect occurred in larvae with reduced expression of this gene only in neurons. The myogenic effects of DPKQDFMRFamide do not appear to be mediated through either of the two <i>Drosophila</i> myosuppressin receptors (<i>DmsR-1</i> and <i>DmsR-2</i>). DPKQDFMRFamide-induced contractions were not reduced in Ala1 transgenic flies lacking activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CamKII), and were not affected by the CaMKII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> KN-93. Peptide-induced contractions in the mutants of the phospholipase C-β (<i>PLC</i>β) gene (<i>norpA</i> larvae) and in IP<sub>3</sub> receptor mutants were similar to contractions elicited in control larvae. The peptide failed to increase cAMP and cGMP levels in <i>Drosophila</i> body wall muscles. Peptide-induced contractions were not potentiated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>, and were not antagonized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s of cAMP-dependent or cGMP-dependent protein kinases. Additionally, exogenous application of arachidonic acid failed to induce myogenic contractions. Thus, DPKQDFMRFamide induces contractions via a G-protein coupled FMRFamide receptor in muscle cells but does not appear to act via cAMP, cGMP, IP<sub>3</sub>, PLC, CaMKII or arachidonic acid.</p>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Urinary glucose excretion with empagliflozin decreases with declining renal function, resulting in less potency for glucose lowering in patients with kidney disease. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to standard of care. We analyzed cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in patients with prevalent kidney disease (defined as eGFR <60 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> and/or urine albumin-creatinine ratio >300 mg/g) at baseline. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional analyses were performed in subgroups by baseline eGFR (<45, 45–<60, 60–<90, ≥90 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>) and baseline urine albumin-creatinine ratio (>300, 30–≤300, <30 mg/g).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 7020 patients treated, 2250 patients had prevalent kidney disease at baseline, of whom 67% had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for >10 years, 58% were receiving insulin, and 84% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s or angiotensin receptor blockers. In patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 29% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–0.98), the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99), the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 39% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.87), and the risk of all-cause hospitalization by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.92). Effects of empagliflozin on these outcomes were consistent across categories of eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine ratio at baseline and across the 2 doses studied.

Transcatheter Treatment of Severe Tricuspid Regurgitation With the Edge-to-Edge MitraClip Technique
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current surgical and medical treatment options for severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) are limited, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional interventional approaches are required. In the present observational study, the safety and feasibility of transcatheter repair of chronic severe TR with the MitraClip system were evaluated. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, the effects on clinical symptoms were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with heart failure symptoms and severe TR on optimal medical treatment were treated with the MitraClip system. Safety, defined as periprocedural adverse events such as death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiac tamponade, and feasibility, defined as successful implantation of 1 or more MitraClip devices and reduction of TR by at least 1 grade, were evaluated before discharge and after 30 days. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, functional outcome, defined as changes in New York Heart Assocation class and 6-minute walking distance, were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 64 consecutive patients (mean age 76.6±10 years) deemed unsuitable for surgery who underwent MitraClip treatment for chronic, severe TR for compassionate use. Functional TR was present in 88%; in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, 22 patients were also treated with the MitraClip system for mitral regurgitation as a combined procedure. The degree of TR was severe or massive in 88% of patients before the procedure. The MitraClip device was successfully implanted in the tricuspid valve in 97% of the cases. After the procedure, TR was reduced by at least 1 grade in 91% of the patients, thereof 4% that were reduced from massive to severe. In 13% of patients, TR remained severe after the procedure. Significant reductions in effective regurgitant orifice area (0.9±0.3cm<sup>2</sup> versus 0.4±0.2cm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.001), vena contracta width (1.1±0.5 cm versus 0.6±0.3 cm; <i>P</i>=0.001), and regurgitant volume (57.2±12.8 mL/beat versus 30.8±6.9 mL/beat; <i>P</i><0.001) were observed. No intraprocedural deaths, cardiac tamponade, emergency surgery, stroke, myocardial infarction, or major vascular complications occurred. Three (5%) in-hospital deaths occurred. New York Heart Association class was significantly improved (<i>P</i><0.001), and 6-minute walking distance increased significantly (165.9±102.5 m versus 193.5±115.9 m; <i>P</i>=0.007).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Transcatheter treatment of TR with the MitraClip system seems to be safe and feasible in this cohort of preselected patients.

Medical Therapy for Secondary Prevention and Long-Term Outcome in Patients With Myocardial Infarction With Nonobstructive Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 5% to 10% of all patients with myocardial infarction. Clinical trials of secondary prevention treatment in MINOCA patients are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between treatment with statins, renin-angiotensin system blockers, β-blockers, dual antiplatelet therapy, and long-term cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This is an observational study of MINOCA patients recorded in the SWEDEHEART registry (the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapy) between July 2003 and June 2013 and followed until December 2013 for outcome events in the Swedish Cause of Death Register and National Patient Register. Of 199 162 myocardial infarction admissions, 9466 consecutive unique patients with MINOCA were identified. Among those, the 9136 patients surviving the first 30 days after discharge constituted the study population. Mean age was 65.3 years, and 61% were women. No patient was lost to follow-up. A stratified propensity score analysis was performed to match treated and untreated groups. The association between treatment and outcome was estimated by comparing between treated and untreated groups by using Cox proportional hazards models. The exposures were treatment at discharge with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac events defined as all-cause mortality, hospitalization for myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and heart failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At discharge, 84.5%, 64.1%, 83.4%, and 66.4% of the patients were on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers, β-blockers, and dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively. During the follow-up of a mean of 4.1 years, 2183 (23.9%) patients experienced a major adverse cardiac event. The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for major adverse cardiac events were 0.77 (0.68–0.87), 0.82 (0.73–0.93), and 0.86 (0.74–1.01) in patients on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers, and β-blockers, respectively. For patients on dual antiplatelet therapy followed for 1 year, the hazard ratio was 0.90 (0.74–1.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The results indicate long-term beneficial effects of treatment with statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s/angiotensin receptor blockers on outcome in patients with MINOCA, a trend toward a positive effect of β-blocker treatment, and a neutral effect of dual antiplatelet therapy. Properly powered randomized clinical trials to confirm these results are warranted.</p></sec>

KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibition produces a driver-limited state revealing collateral dependencies
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s targeting KRAS<sup>G12C</sup>, a mutant form of the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) KRAS, are a promising new class of oncogene-specific therapeutics for the treatment of tumors driven by the mutant protein.

Our data revealed genes that were selectively essential in this oncogenic driver–limited cell state, meaning that their loss enhanced cellular susceptibility to direct KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> inhibition. We termed such genes “collateral dependencies” (CDs) and identified two classes of combination therapies targeting these CDs that increased KRAS<sup>G12C</sup> target engagement or blocked residual survival pathways in cells and in vivo. From our findings, we propose a framework for assessing genetic dependencies induced by oncogene inhibition.</p>

Covalent inhibitors of EGFR family protein kinases induce degradation of human Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) pseudokinase in cancer cells
<p>A major challenge associated with biochemical and cellular analysis of pseudokinases is a lack of target-validated small-molecule compounds with which to probe function. Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with a diverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There is substantial evidence that human TRIB2 promotes survival and drug resistance in solid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutic target. The unusual TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-rich C-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminal tail, which also supports its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases. We found that TRIB2 is a target of previously described small-molecule protein kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinase domains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Using a thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB2-binding compounds within the Published Kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> Set (PKIS) and used a drug repurposing approach to classify compounds that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB2 in vitro. TRIB2 destabilizing agents, including the covalent drug afatinib, led to rapid TRIB2 degradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signaling and survival. Our data reveal new drug leads for the development of TRIB2-degrading compounds, which will also be invaluable for unraveling the cellular mechanisms of TRIB2-based signaling. Our study highlights that small molecule–induced protein down-regulation through drug “off-targets” might be relevant for other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s that serendipitously target pseudokinases.</p>

Mechanism of allosteric modulation of P-glycoprotein by transport substrates and inhibitors
<p>The ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein plays a central role in clearance of xenobiotics in humans and is implicated in cancer resistance to chemotherapy. We used double electron electron resonance spectroscopy to uncover the basis of stimulation of P-glycoprotein adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis by multiple substrates and illuminate how substrates and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s differentially affect its transport function. Our results reveal that substrate-induced acceleration of ATP hydrolysis correlates with stabilization of a high-energy, post-ATP hydrolysis state characterized by structurally asymmetric nucleotide-binding sites. By contrast, this state is destabilized in the substrate-free cycle and by high-affinity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s in favor of structurally symmetric nucleotide binding sites. Together with previous data, our findings lead to a general model of substrate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> coupling to P-glycoprotein.</p>

Vasohibins/SVBP are tubulin carboxypeptidases (TCPs) that regulate neuron differentiation
<p>Reversible detyrosination of α-tubulin is crucial to microtubule dynamics and functions, and defects have been implicated in cancer, brain disorganization, and cardiomyopathies. The identity of the tubulin tyrosine carboxypeptidase (TCP) responsible for detyrosination has remained unclear. We used chemical proteomics with a potent irreversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> to show that the major brain TCP is a complex of vasohibin-1 (VASH1) with the small vasohibin binding protein (SVBP). VASH1 and its homolog VASH2, when complexed with SVBP, exhibited robust and specific Tyr/Phe carboxypeptidase activity on microtubules. Knockdown of vasohibins or SVBP and/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion in cultured neurons reduced detyrosinated α-tubulin levels and caused severe differentiation defects. Furthermore, knockdown of vasohibins disrupted neuronal migration in developing mouse neocortex. Thus, vasohibin/SVBP complexes represent long-sought TCP enzymes.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Initial Bud Outgrowth Occurs Independent of Auxin Flow from Out of Buds
<p>Apical dominance is the process whereby the shoot tip inhibits the growth of axillary buds along the stem. It has been proposed that the shoot tip, which is the predominant source of the plant hormone auxin, prevents bud outgrowth by suppressing auxin canalization and export from axillary buds into the main stem. In this theory, auxin flow out of axillary buds is a prerequisite for bud outgrowth, and buds are triggered to grow by an enhanced proportional flow of auxin from the buds. A major challenge of directly testing this model is in being able to create a bud- or stem-specific change in auxin transport. Here we evaluate the relationship between specific changes in auxin efflux from axillary buds and bud outgrowth after shoot tip removal (decapitation) in the pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>). The auxin transport <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> 1-<i>N</i>-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and to a lesser extent, the auxin perception <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> <i>p</i>-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB), effectively blocked auxin efflux from axillary buds of intact and decapitated plants without affecting auxin flow in the main stem. Gene expression analyses indicate that NPA and PCIB regulate auxin-inducible, and biosynthesis and transport genes, in axillary buds within 3 h after application. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s had no effect on initial bud outgrowth after decapitation or cytokinin (benzyladenine; BA) treatment. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>y effects of PCIB and NPA on axillary bud outgrowth only became apparent from 48 h after treatment. These findings demonstrate that the initiation of decapitation- and cytokinin-induced axillary bud outgrowth is independent of auxin canalization and export from the bud.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an accumulation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to accumulate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG accumulation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG accumulation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants overaccumulating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of chloroplast metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning chloroplast function is to establish the relationship between these two redox systems and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has antioxidant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ed phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant chloroplast ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in chloroplast redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons chloroplasts, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

Metabolic Control of Tobacco Pollination by Sugars and Invertases
<p>Pollination in flowering plants is initiated by germination of pollen grains on stigmas followed by fast growth of pollen tubes representing highly energy-consuming processes. The symplastic isolation of pollen grains and tubes requires import of Suc available in the apoplast. We show that the functional coupling of Suc cleavage by invertases and uptake of the released hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollination in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolocalization of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo support the functional coupling in supplying carbohydrates for pollen germination and tube growth evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated expression. Detection of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk between male and female tissues and supported the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollination. Tissue-specific expression of an invertase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of the chemical invertase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired pollen germination. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously available Suc into the germinating pollen operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after cleavage by extracellular invertase. Reduction of extracellular invertase activity in pollen decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises pollen germination. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for pollen germination, whereas Suc is supporting tube growth, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulation of pollination by carbohydrates.</p>

Combined Experimental and Computational Approaches Reveal Distinct pH Dependence of Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitors
<p>The fine-tuning of the degree of methylesterification of cell wall pectin is a key to regulating cell elongation and ultimately the shape of the plant body. Pectin methylesterification is spatiotemporally controlled by pectin methylesterases (PMEs; 66 members in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]). The comparably large number of proteinaceous pectin methylesterase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s (PMEIs; 76 members in Arabidopsis) questions the specificity of the PME-PMEI interaction and the functional role of such abundance. To understand the difference, or redundancy, between PMEIs, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the behavior of two PMEIs that are coexpressed and have distinct effects on plant development: AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9. Simulations revealed the structural determinants of the pH dependence for the interaction of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s with AtPME3, a major PME expressed in roots. Key residues that are likely to play a role in the pH dependence were identified. The predictions obtained from MD simulations were confirmed in vitro, showing that AtPMEI9 is a stronger, less pH-independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> compared with AtPMEI4. Using pollen tubes as a developmental model, we showed that these biochemical differences have a biological significance. Application of purified proteins at pH ranges in which PMEI inhibition differed between AtPMEI4 and AtPMEI9 had distinct consequences on pollen tube elongation. Therefore, MD simulations have proven to be a powerful tool to predict functional diversity between PMEIs, allowing the discovery of a strategy that may be used by PMEIs to inhibit PMEs in different microenvironmental conditions and paving the way to identify the specific role of PMEI diversity in muro.</p>

Intracellular pH and its response to CO<sub>2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in symbiotic <i>versus</i> non-symbiotic coral cells
<p>Regulating intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) is critical for optimising the metabolic activity of corals, yet the mechanisms involved in pH regulation and the buffering capacity within coral cells are not well understood. Our study investigated how the presence of symbiotic dinoflagellates affects the response of pH<sub>i</sub> to <i>P</i><sub>CO2</sub>-driven seawater acidification in cells isolated from <i>Pocillopora damicornis</i>. Using the fluorescent dye BCECF-AM, in conjunction with confocal microscopy, we simultaneously characterised the pH<sub>i</sub> response in host coral cells and their dinoflagellate symbionts, in symbiotic and non-symbiotic states under saturating light, with and without the photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> DCMU. Each treatment was run under control (pH 7.8) and CO<sub>2</sub>-acidified seawater conditions (decreasing pH from 7.8 to 6.8). After 105 min of CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, by which time the external pH (pH<sub>e</sub>) had declined to 6.8, the dinoflagellate symbionts had increased their pH<sub>i</sub> by 0.5 pH units above control levels when in the absence of DCMU. In contrast, in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic host coral cells, 15 min of CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion (0.2 pH unit drop in pH<sub>e</sub>) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0.3–0.4 pH units irrespective of whether DCMU was present. Despite further seawater acidification over the duration of the experiment, the pH<sub>i</sub> of non-symbiotic coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the pH<sub>i</sub> recovered to control levels when photsynthesis was not inhibited. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that photosynthetic activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from cellular acidosis after exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>/low pH.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
A new and clinically relevant murine model of solid-organ transplant aspergillosis
<p>Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of death in organ transplant patients. The murine hydrocortisone-mediated immunosuppression model of pulmonary aspergillosis is commonly used to characterise IFIs in these patients. However, this model does not take into account the effects of calcineurin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s on transplant immunity to IFIs or the fungal calcineurin pathway, which is required for both virulence and antifungal drug resistance. To address these two issues, a new and clinically relevant transplant immunosuppression model of tacrolimus (FK506) and hydrocortisone-associated pulmonary aspergillosis was developed. We first characterised IFIs in 406 patients with a lung transplant. This showed that all of the patients with pulmonary aspergillosis were immunosuppressed with calcineurin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s and steroids. Murine pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that an ideal dose of 1 mg/kg/day of FK506 intraperitoneally produced blood trough levels in the human therapeutic range (5–12 ng/ml). There was increased mortality from pulmonary aspergillosis in a transplant-relevant immunosuppression model using both FK506 and hydrocortisone as compared with immunosuppression using hydrocortisone only. Lung histopathology showed neutrophil invasion and tracheobronchitis that was associated with reduced lung tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα), JE (homologue of human MCP-1) and KC (homologue of human IL-8) at 24 hours, but increased lung TNFα, JE and KC at 48 hours when fungal burden was high. Furthermore, FK506 directly impaired fungal killing in alveolar macrophages <i>in vitro</i>, with FK506-mediated inhibition of the radial growth of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro</i> occurring at the low concentration of 5 ng/ml. Taken together, these findings show that the immunosuppressive activity of FK506 outweighs its antifungal activity <i>in vivo</i>. These observations demonstrate that FK506 impairs innate immune responses and leads to an incremental increase in susceptibility to IFIs when it is combined with steroids. This new and clinically relevant mouse model of invasive aspergillosis is a valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to the further study of both fungal immunity and antifungal therapy in organ transplantation.</p>

Inhibition of JAK-STAT Signaling Suppresses Pathogenic Immune Responses in Medium and Large Vessel Vasculitis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Giant cell arteritis, a chronic autoimmune disease of the aorta and its large branches, is complicated by aneurysm formation, dissection, and arterial occlusions. Arterial wall dendritic cells attract CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages to form prototypic granulomatous infiltrates. Vasculitic lesions contain a diverse array of effector T cells that persist despite corticosteroid therapy and sustain chronic, smoldering vasculitis. Transmural inflammation induces microvascular neoangiogenesis and results in lumen-occlusive intimal hyperplasia. We have examined whether persistent vessel wall inflammation is maintained by lesional T cells, including the newly identified tissue-resident memory T cells, and whether such T cells are sensitive to the cytokine-signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> targeting JAK3 and JAK1.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Vascular inflammation was induced in human arteries engrafted into immunodeficient mice that were reconstituted with T cells and monocytes from patients with giant cell arteritis. Mice carrying inflamed human arteries were treated with tofacitinib or vehicle. Vasculitic arteries were examined for gene expression (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), protein expression (immunohistochemistry), and infiltrating cell populations (flow cytometry).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Tofacitinib effectively suppressed innate and adaptive immunity in the vessel wall. Lesional T cells responded to tofacitinib with reduced proliferation rates (<10%) and minimal production of the effector molecules interferon-γ, interleukin-17, and interleukin-21. Tofacitinib disrupted adventitial microvascular angiogenesis, reduced outgrowth of hyperplastic intima, and minimized CD4<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident memory T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cytokine signaling dependent on JAK3 and JAK1 is critically important in chronic inflammation of medium and large arteries. The JAK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> tofacitinib effectively suppresses tissue-resident memory T cells and inhibits core vasculitogenic effector pathways.</p></sec>

Recurrent Hospitalization Among Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Intracoronary Stenting Treated With 2 Treatment Strategies of Rivaroxaban or a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment Strategy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with atrial fibrillation who undergo intracoronary stenting traditionally are treated with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) plus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), yet this treatment leads to high risks of bleeding. We hypothesized that a regimen of rivaroxaban plus a P2Y<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> monotherapy or rivaroxaban plus DAPT could reduce bleeding and thereby have a favorable impact on all-cause mortality and the need for rehospitalization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Stented subjects with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (n=2124) were randomized 1:1:1 to administration of reduced-dose rivaroxaban 15 mg daily plus a P2Y<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> for 12 months (group 1); rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily with stratification to a prespecified duration of DAPT of 1, 6, or 12 months (group 2); or the reference arm of dose-adjusted VKA daily with a similar DAPT stratification (group 3).

A Critical Appraisal of Aspirin in Secondary Prevention
<p>Aspirin represents the <i>sine qua non</i> for antiplatelet pharmacotherapy in patients with cardiovascular diseases because of its well-established role in secondary prevention and its widespread availability and affordability. Historical studies, conducted in an era that bears little resemblance to contemporary clinical practice, demonstrated large reductions in thrombotic risk when aspirin was compared with placebo, thus forming the evidence base promulgated in practice guidelines and recommendations. P2Y<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s have mostly been studied in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to aspirin; dual-antiplatelet therapy proved superiority compared with aspirin monotherapy for the prevention of ischemic events, despite increased bleeding risks. An alternative approach currently under investigation includes evaluation of single-antiplatelet therapy with P2Y<sub>12</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s alone versus dual-antiplatelet therapy after acute coronary syndromes or coronary stent implantation. As the availability of more effective antiplatelet agents increases, it is time to revisit the existing and long-standing paradigm supporting aspirin use for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events. Ongoing trials will provide new evidence whether the less-is-more strategy is justified.</p>

Basal aurora kinase B activity is sufficient for histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase
<p>Histone H3 phosphorylation is the hallmark of mitosis deposited by aurora kinase B. Benzo[e]pyridoindoles are a family of potent, broad, ATP-competitive aurora kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. However, benzo[e]pyridoindole C4 only inhibits histone H3 phosphorylation in prophase but not in metaphase. Under the C4 treatment, the cells enter into mitosis with dephosphorylated histone H3, assemble chromosomes normally and progress to metaphase, and then to anaphase. C4 also induces lagging chromosome in anaphase but we demonstrated that these chromosome compaction defects are not related to the absence of H3 phosphorylation in prophase. As a result of C4 action, mitosis lasts longer and the cell cycle is slowed down.</p><p>We reproduced the mitotic defects with reduced concentrations of potent pan aurora kinase as well as with a specific aurora B ATP-competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>; we therefore propose that histone H3 phosphorylation and anaphase chromosome compaction involve the basal activity of aurora kinase B. Our data suggest that aurora kinase B is progressively activated at mitosis entry and at anaphase onset. The full activation of aurora kinase B by its partners, in prometaphase, induces a shift in the catalytic domain of aurora B that modifies its affinity for ATP. These waves of activation/deactivation of aurora B correspond to different conformations of the chromosomal complex revealed by FRAP.</p><p>The presence of lagging chromosomes may have deleterious consequences on the daughter cells and, unfortunately, the situation may be encountered in patients receiving treatment with aurora kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s.</p>

Calcium Deficiency Triggers Phloem Remobilization of Cadmium in a Hyperaccumulating Species
<p>Understanding cadmium (Cd) accumulation in plants is critical for the development of plant-based strategies for soil remediation and crop safety. <i>Sedum alfredii</i> is a nonbrassica plant species known to hyperaccumulate Cd. The characteristics of Cd uptake, distribution, and retranslocation affected by the Ca status were investigated at cellular levels in <i>S. alfredii</i>. Low Ca supply significantly increased Cd contents in shoots of <i>S. alfredii</i>, particularly in the young leaves. Micro x-ray fluorescence images confirmed that sequestration of Cd was greatly enhanced in the young leaves under Ca deficiency stress, with a significant amount of Cd localized in mesophyll cells, compared to the young leaves supplied with high Ca levels. Cd influx into protoplasts isolated from young leaves was significantly inhibited by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion of Ca channel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s, but not by pre-exposure to Ca deficiency. In stems, the Cd signal in vascular systems under low Ca levels was 10-fold higher than in those treated with higher Ca levels. A detailed investigation of vascular bundles revealed that an extremely high Cd signal induced by low Ca supply occurred in the phloem tissues, but not in the xylem tissues. Transfer of Cd pretreated plants to nutrient solutions at different Ca levels confirmed that a much higher amount of Cd was reallocated to the new growth tissues under low Ca stress compared to plants supplied with sufficient Ca. These results suggest that Ca deficiency triggered a highly efficient phloem remobilization of Cd in <i>S. alfredii</i> and subsequently enhanced Cd accumulation in its young leaves.</p>

A Tomato Vacuolar Invertase Inhibitor Mediates Sucrose Metabolism and Influences Fruit Ripening
<p>Fruit ripening is a complex process that involves a series of physiological and biochemical changes that ultimately influence fruit quality traits, such as color and flavor. Sugar metabolism is an important factor in ripening, and there is evidence that it influences various aspects of ripening, although the associated mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we identified and analyzed the expression of 36 genes involved in Suc metabolism in ripening tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) fruit. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel mobility shift assays indicated that <i>SlVIF</i>, which encodes a vacuolar invertase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>, and <i>SlVI</i>, encoding a vacuolar invertase, are directly regulated by the global fruit ripening regulator RIPENING <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> (RIN). Moreover, we showed that SlVIF physically interacts with SlVI to control Suc metabolism. Repression of <i>SlVIF</i> by RNA interference delayed tomato fruit ripening, while overexpression of <i>SlVIF</i> accelerated ripening, with concomitant changes in lycopene production and ethylene biosynthesis. An isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification-based quantitative proteomic analysis further indicated that the abundance of a set of proteins involved in fruit ripening was altered by suppressing <i>SlVIF</i> expression, including proteins associated with lycopene generation and ethylene synthesis. These findings provide evidence for the role of Suc in promoting fruit ripening and establish that <i>SlVIF</i> contributes to fruit quality and the RIN-mediated ripening regulatory mechanisms, which are of significant agricultural value.</p>

A NAC Transcription Factor Represses Putrescine Biosynthesis and Affects Drought Tolerance
<p>Arginine decarboxylase (ADC)-mediated putrescine biosynthesis plays an important role in plant stress responses, but the transcriptional regulation of <i>ADC</i> in response to abiotic stress is not well understood. We isolated a NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) domain-containing transcription factor, PtrNAC72, from trifoliate orange (<i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>) by yeast one-hybrid screening. PtrNAC72, localized to the nucleus, binds specifically to the promoter of <i>PtADC</i> and acts as a transcriptional repressor. <i>PtrNAC72</i> expression was induced by cold, drought, and abscisic acid. <i>ADC</i> messenger RNA abundance and putrescine levels were decreased in transgenic tobacco (<i>Nicotiana nudicaulis</i>) plants overexpressing <i>PtrNAC72</i> but increased, compared with the wild type, in an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) transfer DNA insertion mutant, <i>nac72</i>. While transgenic tobacco lines overexpressing <i>PtrNAC72</i> were more sensitive to drought, plants of the Arabidopsis <i>nac72</i> mutant exhibited enhanced drought tolerance, consistent with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the tested genotypes. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, exogenous application of putrescine to the overexpression lines restored drought tolerance, while treatment with <sc>d</sc>-arginine, an ADC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>, compromised the drought tolerance of <i>nac72</i>. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PtrNAC72 is a repressor of putrescine biosynthesis and may negatively regulate the drought stress response, at least in part, via the modulation of putrescine-associated reactive oxygen species homeostasis.</p>

The Proteasome Acts as a Hub for Plant Immunity and Is Targeted by <i>Pseudomonas</i> Type III Effectors
<p>Recent evidence suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in several aspects of plant immunity and that a range of plant pathogens subvert the ubiquitin-proteasome system to enhance their virulence. Here, we show that proteasome activity is strongly induced during basal defense in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Mutant lines of the proteasome subunits <i>RPT2a</i> and <i>RPN12a</i> support increased bacterial growth of virulent <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 (<i>Pst</i>) and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> ES4326. Both proteasome subunits are required for pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity responses. Analysis of bacterial growth after a secondary infection of systemic leaves revealed that the establishment of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is impaired in proteasome mutants, suggesting that the proteasome also plays an important role in defense priming and SAR. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, we show that <i>Pst</i> inhibits proteasome activity in a type III secretion-dependent manner. A screen for type III effector proteins from <i>Pst</i> for their ability to interfere with proteasome activity revealed HopM1, HopAO1, HopA1, and HopG1 as putative proteasome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong>s. Biochemical characterization of HopM1 by mass spectrometry indicates that HopM1 interacts with several E3 ubiquitin ligases and proteasome subunits. This supports the hypothesis that HopM1 associates with the proteasome, leading to its inhibition. Thus, the proteasome is an essential component of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity and SAR, which is targeted by multiple bacterial effectors.</p>

Insights from the Shell Proteome: Biomineralization to Adaptation
<p>Bivalves have evolved a range of complex shell forming mechanisms that are reflected by their incredible diversity in shell mineralogy and microstructures. A suite of proteins exported to the shell matrix space plays a significant role in controlling these features, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion to underpinning some of the physical properties of the shell itself. Although, there is a general consensus that a minimum basic protein tool kit is required for shell construction, to date, this remains undefined. In this study, the shell matrix proteins (SMPs) of four highly divergent bivalves (The Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>; the blue mussel, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>; the clam, <i>Mya truncata</i>, and the king scallop, <i>Pecten maximus</i>) were analyzed in an identical fashion using proteomics pipeline. This enabled us to identify the critical elements of a “basic tool kit” for calcification processes, which were conserved across the taxa irrespective of the shell morphology and arrangement of the crystal surfaces. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, protein domains controlling the crystal layers specific to aragonite and calcite were also identified. Intriguingly, a significant number of the identified SMPs contained domains related to immune functions. These were often are unique to each species implying their involvement not only in immunity, but also environmental adaptation. This suggests that the SMPs are selectively exported in a complex mix to endow the shell with both mechanical protection and biochemical defense.</p>

Comparative Genomics of the Pine Pathogens and Beetle Symbionts in the Genus <i>Grosmannia</i>
<p>Studies on beetle/tree fungal symbionts typically characterize the ecological and geographic distributions of the fungal populations. There is limited understanding of the genome-wide evolutionary processes that act within and between species as such fungi adapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess genomic evidence for such evolutionary processes by extending our recent work on <i>Grosmannia clavigera</i>, which is vectored by the mountain pine beetle and jeffrey pine beetle. We report the genome sequences of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional 11 <i>G. clavigera</i> (Gc) sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species, <i>Grosmannia</i> sp. (Gs) and Gc. The 12 fungal genomes are structurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between species. We identified 103,430 single-nucleotide variations that separated the <i>Grosmannia</i> strains into divergent Gs and Gc clades, and further divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which may represent an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional species. Comparing variable genes between these lineages, we identified truncated genes and potential pseudogenes, as well as seven genes that show evidence of positive selection. As these variable genes are involved in secondary metabolism and in detoxifying or utilizing host-tree defense chemicals (e.g., polyketide synthases, oxidoreductases, and mono-oxygenases), their variants may reflect adaptation to the specific chemistries of the host trees <i>Pinus contorta</i>, <i>P. ponderosa</i>, and <i>P. jeffreyi</i>. This work provides a comprehensive resource for developing informative markers for landscape population genomics of these ecologically and economically important fungi, and an approach that could be extended to other beetle–tree-associated fungi.</p>

An increase in minimum metabolic rate and not activity explains field metabolic rate changes in a breeding seabird
<p>The field metabolic rate (FMR) of a free-ranging animal can be considered as the sum of its maintenance costs (minimum metabolic rate, MMR) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional costs associated with thermoregulation, digestion, production and activity. However, the relationships between FMR and BMR and how they relate to behaviour and extrinsic influences is not clear. In seabirds, FMR has been shown to increase during the breeding season. This is presumed to be the result of an increase in foraging activity, stimulated by increased food demands from growing chicks, but few studies have investigated in detail the factors that underlie these increases. We studied free-ranging Australasian gannets (<i>Morus serrator</i>) throughout their 5 month breeding season, and evaluated FMR, MMR and activity-related metabolic costs on a daily basis using the heart rate method. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, we simultaneously recorded behaviour (flying and diving) in the same individuals. FMR increased steadily throughout the breeding season, increasing by 11% from the incubation period to the long chick-brooding period. However, this was not accompanied by either an increase in flying or diving behaviour, or an increase in the energetic costs of activity. Instead, the changes in FMR could be explained exclusively by a progressive increase in MMR. Seasonal changes in MMR could be due to a change in body composition or a decrease in body condition associated with changing the allocation of resources between provisioning adults and growing chicks. Our study highlights the importance of measuring physiological parameters continuously in free-ranging animals in order to understand fully the mechanisms underpinning seasonal changes in physiology and behaviour.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea stars are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea stars in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea stars transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea stars adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Draft genome sequence of an elite <i>Dura</i> palm and whole-genome patterns of DNA variation in oil palm
<p>Oil palm is the world’s leading source of vegetable oil and fat. <i>Dura, Pisifera</i> and <i>Tenera</i> are three forms of oil palm. The genome sequence of <i>Pisifera</i> is available whereas the <i>Dura</i> form has not been sequenced yet. We sequenced the genome of one elite <i>Dura</i> palm, and re-sequenced 17 palm genomes. The assemble genome sequence of the elite <i>Dura</i> tree contained 10,971 scaffolds and was 1.701 Gb in length, covering 94.49% of the oil palm genome. 36,105 genes were predicted. Re-sequencing of 17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional palm trees identified 18.1 million SNPs. We found high genetic variation among palms from different geographical regions, but lower variation among Southeast Asian <i>Dura</i> and <i>Pisifera</i> palms. We mapped 10,000 SNPs on the linkage map of oil palm. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, high linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the oil palms used in breeding populations of Southeast Asia, suggesting that LD mapping is likely to be practical in this important oil crop. Our data provide a valuable resource for accelerating genetic improvement and studying the mechanism underlying phenotypic variations of important oil palm traits.</p>

Ligand-dependent Notch signaling strength orchestrates lateral induction and lateral inhibition in the developing inner ear
<p>During inner ear development, Notch exhibits two modes of operation: lateral induction, which is associated with prosensory specification, and lateral inhibition, which is involved in hair cell determination. These mechanisms depend respectively on two different ligands, jagged 1 (Jag1) and delta 1 (Dl1), that rely on a common signaling cascade initiated after Notch activation. In the chicken otocyst, expression of Jag1 and the Notch target Hey1 correlates well with lateral induction, whereas both Jag1 and Dl1 are expressed during lateral inhibition, as are Notch targets Hey1 and Hes5. Here, we show that Jag1 drives lower levels of Notch activity than Dl1, which results in the differential expression of Hey1 and Hes5. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, Jag1 interferes with the ability of Dl1 to elicit high levels of Notch activity. Modeling the sensory epithelium when the two ligands are expressed together shows that ligand regulation, differential signaling strength and ligand competition are crucial to allow the two modes of operation and for establishing the alternate pattern of hair cells and supporting cells. Jag1, while driving lateral induction on its own, facilitates patterning by lateral inhibition in the presence of Dl1. This novel behavior emerges from Jag1 acting as a competitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inhibitor</span></strong> of Dl1 for Notch signaling. Both modeling and experiments show that hair cell patterning is very robust. The model suggests that autoactivation of proneural factor Atoh1, upstream of Dl1, is a fundamental component for robustness. The results stress the importance of the levels of Notch signaling and ligand competition for Notch function.</p>

Contribution of Impaired Parasympathetic Activity to Right Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The beneficial effects of parasympathetic stimulation have been reported in left heart failure, but whether it would be beneficial for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains to be explored. Here, we investigated the relationship between parasympathetic activity and right ventricular (RV) function in patients with PAH, and the potential therapeutic effects of pyridostigmine (PYR), an oral drug stimulating the parasympathetic activity through acetylcholinesterase inhibition, in experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Heart rate recovery after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test was used as a surrogate for parasympathetic activity. RV ejection fraction was assessed in 112 patients with PAH. Expression of nicotinic (α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and muscarinic (muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor) receptors, and acetylcholinesterase activity were evaluated in RV (n=11) and lungs (n=7) from patients with PAH undergoing heart/lung transplantation and compared with tissue obtained from controls. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, we investigated the effects of PYR (40 mg/kg per day) in experimental PH. PH was induced in male rats by SU5416 (25 mg/kg subcutaneously) injection followed by 4 weeks of hypoxia. In a subgroup, sympathetic/parasympathetic modulation was assessed by power spectral analysis. At week 6, PH status was confirmed by echocardiography, and rats were randomly assigned to vehicle or treatment (both n=12). At the end of the study, echocardiography was repeated, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ional RV pressure-volume measurements, along with lung, RV histological, and protein analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients with PAH with lower RV ejection fraction (<41%) had a significantly reduced heart rate recovery in comparison with patients with higher RV ejection fraction. In PAH RV samples, α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was increased and acetylcholinesterase activity was reduced versus controls. No difference in muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression was observed. Chronic PYR treatment in PH rats normalized the cardiovascular autonomic function, demonstrated by an increase in parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity. PYR improved survival, increased RV contractility, and reduced RV stiffness, RV hypertrophy, RV fibrosis, RV inflammation, and RV α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression, as well. Furthermore, PYR reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, RV afterload, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was associated with reduced local and systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RV dysfunction is associated with reduced systemic parasympathetic activity in patients with PAH, with an inadequate adaptive response of the cholinergic system in the RV. Enhancing parasympathetic activity by PYR improved survival, RV function, and pulmonary vascular remodeling in experimental PH.</p></sec>

Increased Cardiac Arrhythmogenesis Associated With Gap Junction Remodeling With Upregulation of RNA-Binding Protein FXR1
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Gap junction remodeling is well established as a consistent feature of human heart disease involving spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. The mechanisms responsible for gap junction remodeling that include alterations in the distribution of, and protein expression within, gap junctions are still debated. Studies reveal that multiple transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory pathways are triggered in response to cardiac disease, such as those involving RNA-binding proteins. The expression levels of FXR1 (fragile X mental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retard</span></strong>ation autosomal homolog 1), an RNA-binding protein, are critical to maintain proper cardiac muscle function; however, the connection between FXR1 and disease is not clear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating gap junction remodeling in cardiac disease, we sought to identify the functional properties of FXR1 expression, direct targets of FXR1 in human left ventricle dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) biopsy samples and mouse models of DCM through BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation, how FXR1 regulates its targets through RNA stability and luciferase assays, and functional consequences of altering the levels of this important RNA-binding protein through the analysis of cardiac-specific FXR1 knockout mice and mice injected with 3xMyc-FXR1 adeno-associated virus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>FXR1 expression is significantly increased in tissue samples from human and mouse models of DCM via Western blot analysis. FXR1 associates with intercalated discs, and integral gap junction proteins Cx43 (connexin 43), Cx45 (connexin 45), and ZO-1 (zonula occludens-1) were identified as novel mRNA targets of FXR1 by using a BioID proximity assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Our findings show that FXR1 is a multifunctional protein involved in translational regulation and stabilization of its mRNA targets in heart muscle. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">addit</span></strong>ion, introduction of 3xMyc-FXR1 via adeno-associated virus into mice leads to the redistribution of gap junctions and promotes ventricular tachycardia, showing the functional significance of FXR1 upregulation observed in DCM.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In DCM, increased FXR1 expression appears to play an important role in disease progression by regulating gap junction remodeling. Together this study provides a novel function of FXR1, namely, that it directly regulates major gap junction components, contributing to proper cell-cell communication in the heart.</p></sec>

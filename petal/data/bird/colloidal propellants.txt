Hybrid molecular-colloidal liquid crystals
<p>Order and fluidity often coexist, with examples ranging from biological membranes to liquid crystals, but the symmetry of these soft-matter systems is typically higher than that of the constituent building blocks. We dispersed micrometer-long inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al rods in a nematic liquid crystalline fluid of molecular rods. Both types of uniaxial building blocks, while freely diffusing, interact to form an orthorhombic nematic fluid, in which like-sized rods are roughly parallel to each other and the molecular ordering direction is orthogonal to that of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al rods. A coarse-grained model explains the experimental temperature-concentration phase diagram with one biaxial and two uniaxial nematic phases, as well as the orientational distributions of rods. Displaying properties of biaxial optical crystals, these hybrid molecular-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al fluids can be switched by electric and magnetic fields.</p>

Self-assembled three-dimensional chiral colloidal architecture
<p>Although stereochemistry has been a central focus of the molecular sciences since Pasteur, its province has previously been restricted to the nanometric scale. We have programmed the self-assembly of micron-sized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al clusters with structural information stemming from a nanometric arrangement. This was done by combining DNA nanotechnology with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al science. Using the functional flexibility of DNA origami in conjunction with the structural rigidity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al particles, we demonstrate the parallel self-assembly of three-dimensional microconstructs, evincing highly specific geometry that includes control over position, dihedral angles, and cluster chirality.</p>

Femtosecond laser reshaping yields gold nanorods with ultranarrow surface plasmon resonances
<p>The irradiation of gold nanorod <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>s with a femtosecond laser can be tuned to induce controlled nanorod reshaping, yielding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>s with exceptionally narrow localized surface plasmon resonance bands. The process relies on a regime characterized by a gentle multishot reduction of the aspect ratio, whereas the rod shape and volume are barely affected. Successful reshaping can only occur within a narrow window of the heat dissipation rate: Low cooling rates lead to drastic morphological changes, and fast cooling has nearly no effect. Hence, a delicate balance must be achieved between irradiation fluence and surface density of the surfactant on the nanorods. This perfection process is appealing because it provides a simple, fast, reproducible, and scalable route toward gold nanorods with an optical response of exceptional quality, near the theoretical limit.</p>

Eye patches: Protein assembly of index-gradient squid lenses
<p>A parabolic relationship between lens radius and refractive index allows spherical lenses to avoid spherical aberration. We show that in squid, patchy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al physics resulted from an evolutionary radiation of globular S-crystallin proteins. Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments on lens tissue show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al gels of S-crystallins at all radial positions. Sparse lens materials form via low-valence linkages between disordered loops protruding from the protein surface. The loops are polydisperse and bind via a set of hydrogen bonds between disordered side chains. Peripheral lens regions with low particle valence form stable, volume-spanning gels at low density, whereas central regions with higher average valence gel at higher densities. The proteins demonstrate an evolved set of linkers for self-assembly of nanoparticles into volumetric materials.</p>

Quantitative 3D evolution of colloidal nanoparticle oxidation in solution
<p>Real-time tracking of the three-dimensional (3D) evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al nanoparticles in solution is essential for understanding complex mechanisms involved in nanoparticle growth and transformation. We used time-resolved small-angle and wide-angle x-ray scattering simultaneously to monitor oxidation of highly uniform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al iron nanoparticles, enabling the reconstruction of intermediate 3D morphologies of the nanoparticles with a spatial resolution of <i>~</i>5 angstroms. The in situ observations, combined with large-scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations, reveal the details of the transformation from solid metal nanoparticles to hollow metal oxide nanoshells via a nanoscale Kirkendall process—for example, coalescence of voids as they grow and reversal of mass diffusion direction depending on crystallinity. Our results highlight the complex interplay between defect chemistry and defect dynamics in determining nanoparticle transformation and formation.</p>

Single-component quasicrystalline nanocrystal superlattices through flexible polygon tiling rule
<p>Quasicrystalline superlattices (QC-SLs) generated from single-component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al building blocks have been predicted by computer simulations but are challenging to reproduce experimentally. We discovered that 10-fold QC-SLs could self-organize from truncated tetrahedral quantum dots with anisotropic patchiness. Transmission electron microscopy and tomography measurements allow structural reconstruction of the QC-SL from the nanoscale packing to the atomic-scale orientation alignments. The unique QC order leads to a tiling concept, the “flexible polygon tiling rule,” that replicates the experimental observations. The keys for the single-component QC-SL formation were identified to be the anisotropic shape and patchiness of the building blocks and the assembly microscopic environment. Our discovery may spur the creation of various superstructures using anisotropic objects through an enthalpy-driven route.</p>

Substrate-engaged 26<i>S</i> proteasome structures reveal mechanisms for ATP-hydrolysis–driven translocation
<p>The 26<i>S</i> proteasome is the primary eukaryotic degradation machine and thus is critically involved in numerous cellular processes. The heterohexameric adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) motor of the proteasome unfolds and translocates targeted protein substrates into the open gate of a proteolytic core while a proteasomal deubiquitinase concomitantly removes substrate-attached ubiquitin chains. However, the mechanisms by which ATP hydrolysis drives the conformational changes responsible for these processes have remained elusive. Here we present the cryo–electron microscopy structures of four distinct conformational states of the actively ATP-hydrolyzing, substrate-engaged 26<i>S</i> proteasome. These structures reveal how mechanical substrate translocation accelerates deubiquitination and how ATP-binding, -hydrolysis, and phosphate-release events are coordinated within the AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) motor to induce conformational changes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propel</span></strong> the substrate through the central pore.</p>

Supracellular contractions propel migration
<p>Constructing multicellular bodies, starting from a single-cell zygote, often requires the movement of cells across considerable distances, which is achieved through cell migration. During embryonic development, as well as in healing and regeneration, cells travel across diverse terrains, which dictates the character of navigation (<i>1</i>). Cancer cells metastasize and migrate into healthy organs, and knowledge of their migration strategies could be important to identify targets to treat advanced disease (<i>2</i>). Some migratory cells cover large distances individually (<i>3</i>), whereas others migrate in groups, with leaders and followers being directed by chemical signals (chemotaxis) (<i>4</i>, <i>5</i>). The exchange of information and resulting motility of such groups has been enigmatic. Moreover, the driving force of collective cell migration has been considered a sum of migratory and signaling activities of individually participating cells. However, according to a study on page 339 of this issue by Shellard <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>), collective cell migration requires formation of cytoskeletal structures that span through adjoining cells at the rear of a cell group to coordinate, orient, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propel</span></strong> the entire group. This mechanism of collective cell migration could be applicable to cancer metastasis and wound healing and might change our understanding of developmental migration.</p>

Building superlattices from individual nanoparticles via template-confined DNA-mediated assembly
<p>DNA programmable assembly has been combined with top-down lithography to construct superlattices of discrete, reconfigurable nanoparticle architectures on a gold surface over large areas. Specifically, the assembly of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al plasmonic nanoparticles with different shapes and sizes is controlled by oligonucleotides containing “locked” nucleic acids and confined environments provided by polymer pores to yield oriented architectures that feature tunable arrangements and independently controllable distances at both nanometer- and micrometer-length scales. These structures, which would be difficult to construct by other common assembly methods, provide a platform to systematically study and control light-matter interactions in nanoparticle-based optical materials. The generality and potential of this approach are explored by identifying a broadband absorber with a solvent polarity response that allows dynamic tuning of visible light absorption.</p>

Architecture of eukaryotic mRNA 3′-end processing machinery
<p>Newly transcribed eukaryotic precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) are processed at their 3′ ends by the ~1-megadalton multiprotein cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF). CPF cleaves pre-mRNAs, adds a polyadenylate tail, and triggers transcription termination, but it is unclear how its various enzymes are coordinated and assembled. Here, we show that the nuclease, polymerase, and phosphatase activities of yeast CPF are organized into three modules. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we determined a 3.5-angstrom-resolution structure of the ~200-kilodalton polymerase module. This revealed four β <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propel</span></strong>lers, in an assembly markedly similar to those of other protein complexes that bind nucleic acid. Combined with in vitro reconstitution experiments, our data show that the polymerase module brings together factors required for specific and efficient polyadenylation, to help coordinate mRNA 3′-end processing.</p>

Observation of mean path length invariance in light-scattering media
<p>The microstructure of a medium strongly influences how light propagates through it. The amount of disorder it contains determines whether the medium is transparent or opaque. Theory predicts that exciting such a medium homogeneously and isotropically makes some of its optical properties depend only on the medium’s outer geometry. Here, we report an optical experiment demonstrating that the mean path length of light is invariant with respect to the microstructure of the medium it scatters through. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al solutions with varying concentration and particle size, the invariance of the mean path length is observed over nearly two orders of magnitude in scattering strength. Our results can be extended to a wide range of systems—however ordered, correlated, or disordered—and apply to all wave-scattering problems.</p>

Tunable porous nanoallotropes prepared by post-assembly etching of binary nanoparticle superlattices

Here, we show that non–close-packed nanoparticle arrays can be fabricated through the selective removal of one of two components comprising binary nanoparticle superlattices. First, a variety of binary nanoparticle superlattices were prepared at the liquid-air interface, including several arrangements that were previously unknown. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the particular role of the liquid in templating the formation of superlattices not achievable through self-assembly in bulk solution. Second, upon stabilization, all of these binary superlattices could be transformed into distinct “nanoallotropes”—nanoporous materials having the same chemical composition but differing in their nanoscale architectures.</p>

Taxon-restricted genes at the origin of a novel trait allowing access to a new environment
<p>Taxon-restricted genes make up a considerable proportion of genomes, yet their contribution to phenotypic evolution is poorly understood.

We discovered that two taxon-restricted genes, which we named <i>geisha</i> and <i>mother-of-geisha</i>, specifically control fan development. <i>geisha</i> originated through a duplication event at the base of the <i>Rhagovelia</i> lineage, and both duplicates acquired a novel expression in a specific cell population prefiguring fan development. These gene duplicates played a central role in <i>Rhagovelia</i>’s adaptation to a new physical environment, demonstrating that the evolution of taxon-restricted genes can contribute directly to evolutionary novelties that allow access to unexploited ecological niches.</p>

Aqueous Au-Pd colloids catalyze selective CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation to CH<sub>3</sub>OH with O<sub>2</sub> under mild conditions

We used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">colloid</span></strong>al gold-palladium nanoparticles, rather than the same nanoparticles supported on titanium oxide, to oxidize methane to methanol with high selectivity (92%) in aqueous solution at mild temperatures. Then, using isotopically labeled oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as an oxidant in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>,</sub> we demonstrated that the resulting methanol incorporated a substantial fraction (70%) of gas-phase O<sub>2</sub>. More oxygenated products were formed than the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> consumed, suggesting that the controlled breakdown of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activates methane, which subsequently incorporates molecular oxygen through a radical process. If a source of methyl radicals can be established, then the selective oxidation of methane to methanol using molecular oxygen is possible.</p>

Interacting amino acid replacements allow poison frogs to evolve epibatidine resistance
<p>Animals that wield toxins face self-intoxication. Poison frogs have a diverse arsenal of defensive alkaloids that target the nervous system. Among them is epibatidine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist that is lethal at microgram doses. Epibatidine shares a highly conserved binding site with acetylcholine, making it difficult to evolve resistance yet maintain nAChR function. Electrophysiological assays of human and frog nAChR revealed that one amino acid replacement, which evolved three times in poison frogs, decreased epibatidine sensitivity but at a cost of acetylcholine sensitivity. However, receptor functionality was rescued by additional amino acid replacements that differed among poison frog lineages. Our results demonstrate how resistance to agonist toxins can evolve and that such genetic changes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propel</span></strong> organisms toward an adaptive peak of chemical defense.</p>

We compare magnetohydrodynamic simulations of spicules with observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Spicules are shown to occur when magnetic tension is amplified and transported upward through interactions between ions and neutrals or ambipolar diffusion. The tension is impulsively released to drive flows, heat plasma (through ambipolar diffusion), and generate Alfvéííéénic waves.</p>

Colloidally prepared La-doped BaSnO<sub>3</sub> electrodes for efficient, photostable perovskite solar cells

Electron microscopy images revealed that at least three different structures form as large single-domain architectures or as multidomain materials. Ordered assemblies, isostructural to clathrates, were identified with the help of molecular simulations and geometric analysis. These structures are the most sophisticated architectures made via programmable assembly, and their formation can be understood based on the shape of the nanoparticle building blocks and mode of DNA functionalization.</p>

The genomic landscape of rapid repeated evolutionary adaptation to toxic pollution in wild fish
<p>Atlantic killifish populations have rapidly adapted to normally lethal levels of pollution in four urban estuaries. Through analysis of 384 whole killifish genome sequences and comparative transcriptomics in four pairs of sensitive and tolerant populations, we identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor–based signaling pathway as a shared target of selection. This suggests evolutionary constraint on adaptive solutions to complex toxicant mixtures at each site. However, distinct molecular variants apparently contribute to adaptive pathway modification among tolerant populations. Selection also targets other toxicity-mediating genes and genes of connected signaling pathways; this indicates complex tolerance phenotypes and potentially compensatory adaptations. Molecular changes are consistent with selection on standing genetic variation. In killifish, high nucleotide diversity has likely been a crucial substrate for selective sweeps to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propel</span></strong> rapid adaptation.</p>

Bacteria recognize subtle differences in liquid crystal deformations, engaging in bipolar swimming in regions of pure splay and bend but switching to unipolar swimming in mixed splay-bend regions. They differentiate topological defects, heading toward defects of positive topological charge and avoiding negative charges.

Arabidopsis Leaf Flatness Is Regulated by PPD2 and NINJA through Repression of <i>CYCLIN D3</i> Genes
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), reduced expression of the transcriptional regulator <i>PEAPOD2</i> (<i>PPD2</i>) results in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propel</span></strong>ler-like rosettes with enlarged and dome-shaped leaves. However, the molecular and cellular processes underlying this peculiar phenotype remain elusive. Here, we studied the interaction between PPD2 and NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ (NINJA) and demonstrated that <i>ninja</i> loss-of-function plants produce rosettes with dome-shaped leaves similar to those of <i>ppd</i> mutants but without the increase in size. We showed that <i>ninja</i> mutants have a convex-shaped primary cell cycle arrest front, putatively leading to excessive cell division in the central leaf blade region. Furthermore, <i>ppd</i> and <i>ninja</i> mutants have a similar increase in the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;2</i> (<i>CYCD3;2</i>), and ectopic overexpression of <i>CYCD3;2</i> phenocopies the <i>ppd</i> and <i>ninja</i> rosette and leaf shape phenotypes without affecting the size.

Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propel</span></strong>led field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-based Plant Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput plant architecture parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

Population Parameters Underlying an Ongoing Soft Sweep in Southeast Asian Malaria Parasites
<p>Multiple <i>kelch13</i> alleles conferring artemisinin resistance (ART-R) are currently spreading through Southeast Asian malaria parasite populations, providing a unique opportunity to observe an ongoing soft selective sweep, investigate why resistance alleles have evolved multiple times and determine fundamental population genetic parameters for <i>Plasmodium</i>. We sequenced <i>kelch13</i> (<i>n</i> = 1,876), genotyped 75 flanking SNPs, and measured clearance rate (<i>n</i> = 3,552) in parasite infections from Western Thailand (2001–2014). We describe 32 independent coding mutations including common mutations outside the <i>kelch13</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propel</span></strong>ler associated with significant reductions in clearance rate. Mutations were first observed in 2003 and rose to 90% by 2014, consistent with a selection coefficient of ∼0.079. ART-R allele diversity rose until 2012 and then dropped as one allele (C580Y) spread to high frequency. The frequency with which adaptive alleles arise is determined by the rate of mutation and the population size. Two factors drive this soft sweep: (1) multiple <i>kelch13</i> amino-acid mutations confer resistance providing a large mutational target—we estimate the target is 87–163 bp. (2) The population mutation parameter (<i>Θ</i> = 2<i>N</i><sub>e</sub><i>μ</i>) can be estimated from the frequency distribution of ART-R alleles and is ∼5.69, suggesting that short term effective population size is 88 thousand to 1.2 million. This is 52–705 times greater than <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> estimated from fluctuation in allele frequencies, suggesting that we have previously underestimated the capacity for adaptive evolution in <i>Plasmodium</i>. Our central conclusions are that retrospective studies may underestimate the complexity of selective events and the <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> relevant for adaptation for malaria is considerably higher than previously estimated.</p>

Crawling without wiggling: muscular mechanisms and kinematics of rectilinear locomotion in boa constrictors
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Unlike most limbless vertebrates, snakes can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propel</span></strong> themselves without bending their long axis because of muscles that both move the skin relative to the underlying skeleton and modulate skin stiffness.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propel</span></strong>lers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent inefficiency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle contraction increases propulsive efficiency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low efficiency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. Efficiency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture size, which reduces efficiency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing efficiency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">propel</span></strong>led swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

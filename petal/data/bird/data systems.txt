PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response as well as in supporting the generation of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues play an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response of plants to light stress.</p>

Discovering relationships between nuclear receptor signaling pathways, genes, and tissues in Transcriptomine
<p>We previously developed a web tool, Transcriptomine, to explore expression profiling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets involving small-molecule or genetic manipulations of nuclear receptor signaling pathways. We describe advances in biocuration, query interface design, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> visualization that enhance the discovery of uncharacterized biology in these pathways using this tool. Transcriptomine currently contains about 45 million <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points encompassing more than 2000 experiments in a reference library of nearly 550 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets retrieved from public archives and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>atically curated. To make the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points more accessible to bench biologists, we classified experimental small molecules and gene manipulations into signaling pathways and experimental tissues and cell lines into physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s and organs. Incorporation of these mappings into Transcriptomine enables the user to readily evaluate tissue-specific regulation of gene expression by nuclear receptor signaling pathways. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points from animal and cell model experiments and from clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets elucidate the roles of nuclear receptor pathways in gene expression events accompanying various normal and pathological cellular processes. In addition, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets targeting non-nuclear receptor signaling pathways highlight transcriptional cross-talk between nuclear receptors and other signaling pathways. We demonstrate with specific examples how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> points that exist in isolation in individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> sets validate each other when connected and made accessible to the user in a single interface. In summary, Transcriptomine allows bench biologists to routinely develop research hypotheses, validate experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, or model relationships between signaling pathways, genes, and tissues.</p>

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density versus cells with high t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma.

Systematic discovery of antiphage defense systems in the microbial pangenome
<p>The arms race between bacteria and phages led to the development of sophisticated antiphage defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, including CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Evidence suggests that known and unknown defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s are located in “defense islands” in microbial genomes. Here, we comprehensively characterized the bacterial defensive arsenal by examining gene families that are clustered next to known defense genes in prokaryotic genomes. Candidate defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>atically engineered and validated in model bacteria for their antiphage activities. We report nine previously unknown antiphage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s and one antiplasmid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> that are widespread in microbes and strongly protect against foreign invaders. These include <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s that adopted components of the bacterial flagella and condensin complexes.

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, predominantly the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Phylogenetic Signal Variation in the Genomes of <i>Medicago</i> (Fabaceae)
<p>Genome-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> offer the opportunity to clarify phylogenetic relationships that are difficult to resolve with few loci, but they can also identify genomic regions with evolutionary history distinct from that of the species history. We collected whole-genome sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from 29 taxa in the legume genus <i>Medicago</i>, then aligned these sequences to the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> reference genome to confidently identify 87 596 variable homologous sites. We used this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set to estimate phylogenetic relationships among <i>Medicago</i> species, to investigate the number of sites needed to provide robust phylogenetic estimates and to identify specific genomic regions supporting topologies in conflict with the genome-wide phylogeny. Our full genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set resolves relationships within the genus that were previously intractable. Subsampling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> reveals considerable variation in phylogenetic signal and power in smaller subsets of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. Even when sampling 5000 sites, no random sample of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> supports a topology identical to that of the genome-wide phylogeny. Phylogenetic relationships estimated from 500-site sliding windows revealed genome regions supporting several alternative species relationships among recently diverged taxa, consistent with the expected effects of deep coalescence or introgression in the recent history of <i>Medicago</i>.

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants
<p>Non-cell autonomous RNA silencing can spread from cell to cell and over long distances in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile gene silencing are poorly understood. Here, we identified a <i>DICER-LIKE2</i> (<i>DCL2</i>)<i>-</i>dependent mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic spread of posttranscriptional RNA silencing, also known as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Using a suite of transgenic <i>DCL</i> RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that <i>N. benthamiana</i> DCL1, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22, 24, and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of <i>DCL2</i> expression reduced the spread of gene silencing, while suppression of <i>DCL3</i> or <i>DCL4</i> expression enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. In contrast to <i>DCL4</i> RNAi lines, <i>DCL2</i>-<i>DCL4</i> double-RNAi lines developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS similar to that observed in <i>DCL2</i> RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that <i>DCL2</i> was required in the scion to respond to the signal, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated <i>DCL</i> genetic pathway in which <i>DCL2</i> plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, while both <i>DCL4</i> and <i>DCL3</i> attenuate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. We discuss the potential role of 21, 22, and 24 nt siRNAs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> types. Using publicly available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>sets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, parameters for expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> normalization and network inference were evaluated. A comprehensive evaluation of these two parameters and a ranked aggregation strategy on network performance, using libraries from 1266 maize samples, were conducted. Three normalization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three normalization methods had very similar performance. For network inference, correlation methods performed better than mutual information methods at some genes. Increasing sample size also had a positive effect on GCN. Aggregating single networks together resulted in improved performance compared to single networks.</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or reflect complex encoding in the central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause complex sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with complex sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. We suggest that sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute complex neural instructions into equivalently complex vocalisations.</p>

Integrated in vivo multiomics analysis identifies p21-activated kinase signaling as a driver of colitis
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that has limited treatment options. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of chronic colonic inflammation (colitis), we performed a multiomics analysis that integrated RNA microarray, total protein mass spectrometry (MS), and phosphoprotein MS measurements from a mouse model of the disease. Because we collected all three types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from individual samples, we tracked information flow from RNA to protein to phosphoprotein and identified signaling molecules that were coordinately or discordantly regulated and pathways that had complex regulation in vivo. For example, the genes encoding acute-phase proteins were expressed in the liver, but the proteins were detected by MS in the colon during inflammation. We also ascertained the types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> that best described particular facets of chronic inflammation. Using gene set enrichment analysis and trans-omics coexpression network analysis, we found that each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set provided a distinct viewpoint on the molecular pathogenesis of colitis. Combining human transcriptomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> with the mouse multiomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> implicated increased p21-activated kinase (Pak) signaling as a driver of colitis. Chemical inhibition of Pak1 and Pak2 with FRAX597 suppressed active colitis in mice. These studies provide translational insights into the mechanisms contributing to colitis and identify Pak as a potential therapeutic target in IBD.</p>

Observation of parity-time symmetry breaking in a single-spin system
<p>Steering the evolution of single spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s is crucial for quantum computing and quantum sensing. The dynamics of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s has been theoretically investigated with parity-time–symmetric Hamiltonians exhibiting exotic properties. Although parity-time symmetry has been explored in classical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, its observation in a single quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remains elusive. We developed a method to dilate a general parity-time–symmetric Hamiltonian into a Hermitian one. The quantum state evolutions ranging from regions of unbroken to broken [Formula] symmetry have been observed with a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. Owing to the universality of the dilation method, our result provides a route for further exploiting and understanding the exotic properties of parity-time symmetric Hamiltonian in quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.</p>

Emergence of coexisting ordered states in active matter systems
<p>Active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can produce a far greater variety of ordered patterns than conventional equilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. In particular, transitions between disorder and either polar- or nematically ordered phases have been predicted and observed in two-dimensional active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, coexistence between phases of different types of order has not been reported. We demonstrate the emergence of dynamic coexistence of ordered states with fluctuating nematic and polar symmetry in an actomyosin motility assay. Combining experiments with agent-based simulations, we identify sufficiently weak interactions that lack a clear alignment symmetry as a prerequisite for coexistence. Thus, the symmetry of macroscopic order becomes an emergent and dynamic property of the active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. These results provide a pathway by which living <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can express different types of order by using identical building blocks.</p>

Connecting neuronal circuits for movement
<p>Movement is the most common final output of nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> activity and is essential for survival. But what makes this seemingly trivial statement so scientifically challenging? Neurons that contribute to when and how our body moves are distributed throughout the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Thus, even a simple movement such as arm flexion requires the coordinated activation of many different neuronal populations across multiple brain regions. A key question is how the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> produces diverse and precise actions aligned with the organisms' behavioral needs. These processes are affected in diseases such as Parkinson's or Huntington's, in which aberrant motor behavior dominates. Recent studies are transformative in how we think about the control of movement. A common denominator of these studies is that brain regions that contribute to motor behavior can no longer be considered as interacting boxes. Instead, deep circuit-level insight based on specific neuronal populations emerges as being critical to revealing motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> organization and understanding its function. It is likely that insights at this level can also help to design more specific and direct interventions for diseases of the motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and neuroprosthetics applied after injuries.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems
<p>Mechanical power limitations emerge from the physical trade-off between force and velocity. Many biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s incorporate power-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small sizes. We establish how power enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own force-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to biological and synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. This analysis defines the cascading challenges of power enhancement, explores their emergent effects in biological and engineered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, and charts a pathway for higher-level analysis and synthesis of power-amplified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.</p>

Recurrences in an isolated quantum many-body system
<p>The complexity of interacting quantum many-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s leads to exceedingly long recurrence times of the initial quantum state for all but the smallest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. For large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, one cannot probe the full quantum state in all its details. Thus, experimentally, recurrences can only be determined on the level of the accessible observables. Realizing a commensurate spectrum of collective excitations in one-dimensional superfluids, we demonstrate recurrences of coherence and long-range order in an interacting quantum many-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> containing thousands of particles. Our findings will enable the study of the coherent dynamics of large quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s even after they have reached a transient thermal-like state.</p>

RNA editing with CRISPR-Cas13
<p>Nucleic acid editing holds promise for treating genetic disease, particularly at the RNA level, where disease-relevant sequences can be rescued to yield functional protein products. Type VI CRISPR-Cas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s contain the programmable single-effector RNA-guided ribonuclease Cas13. We profiled type VI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in order to engineer a Cas13 ortholog capable of robust knockdown and demonstrated RNA editing by using catalytically inactive Cas13 (dCas13) to direct adenosine-to-inosine deaminase activity by ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 2) to transcripts in mammalian cells. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, referred to as RNA Editing for Programmable A to I Replacement (REPAIR), which has no strict sequence constraints, can be used to edit full-length transcripts containing pathogenic mutations. We further engineered this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to create a high-specificity variant and minimized the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to facilitate viral delivery.

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

Tungsten-182 heterogeneity in modern ocean island basalts

EZ-Root-VIS: A Software Pipeline for the Rapid Analysis and Visual Reconstruction of Root System Architecture
<p>If we want to understand how the environment has shaped the appearance and behavior of living creatures, we need to compare groups of individuals that differ in genetic makeup and environment experience. For complex phenotypic features, such as body posture or facial expression in humans, comparison is not straightforward because some of the contributing factors cannot easily be quantified or averaged across individuals. Therefore, computational methods are used to reconstruct representative prototypes using a range of algorithms for filling in missing information and calculating means. The same problem applies to the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> architecture (RSA) of plants. Several computer programs are available for extracting numerical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from root images, but they usually do not offer customized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> analysis or visual reconstruction of RSA. We developed Root-VIS, a free software tool that facilitates the determination of means and variance of many different RSA features across user-selected sets of root images. Furthermore, Root-VIS offers several options to generate visual reconstructions of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s from the averaged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> to enable screening and modeling. We confirmed the suitability of Root-VIS, combined with a new version of EZ-Rhizo, for the rapid characterization of genotype-environment interactions and gene discovery through genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

A New Phenotyping Pipeline Reveals Three Types of Lateral Roots and a Random Branching Pattern in Two Cereals
<p>Recent progress in root phenotyping has focused mainly on increasing throughput for genetic studies, while identifying root developmental patterns has been comparatively underexplored. We introduce a new phenotyping pipeline for producing high-quality spatiotemporal root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> development <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> and identifying developmental patterns within these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. The SmartRoot image-analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and temporal and spatial statistical models were applied to two cereals, pearl millet (<i>Pennisetum glaucum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Semi-Markov switching linear models were used to cluster lateral roots based on their growth rate profiles. These models revealed three types of lateral roots with similar characteristics in both species. The first type corresponds to fast and accelerating roots, the second to rapidly arrested roots, and the third to an intermediate type where roots cease elongation after a few days. These types of lateral roots were retrieved in different proportions in a maize mutant affected in auxin signaling, while the first most vigorous type was absent in maize plants exposed to severe shading. Moreover, the classification of growth rate profiles was mirrored by a ranking of anatomical traits in pearl millet. Potential dependencies in the succession of lateral root types along the primary root were then analyzed using variable-order Markov chains. The lateral root type was not influenced by the shootward neighbor root type or by the distance from this root. This random branching pattern of primary roots was remarkably conserved, despite the high variability of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in both species. Our phenotyping pipeline opens the door to exploring the genetic variability of lateral root developmental patterns.</p>

A Genetic Screen for Impaired Systemic RNAi Highlights the Crucial Role of DICER-LIKE 2
<p>Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of transgenes involves abundant 21-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and low-abundance 22-nucleotide siRNAs produced from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by DCL4 and DCL2, respectively. However, DCL2 facilitates the recruitment of RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) to ARGONAUTE 1-derived cleavage products, resulting in more efficient amplification of secondary and transitive dsRNA and siRNAs. Here, we describe a reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> where RDR6-dependent PTGS is initiated by restricted expression of an inverted-repeat dsRNA specifically in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root tip, allowing a genetic screen to identify mutants impaired in RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Our screen identified <i>dcl2</i> but not <i>dcl4</i> mutants. Moreover, grafting experiments showed that DCL2, but not DCL4, is required in both the source rootstock and the recipient shoot tissue for efficient RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Furthermore, <i>dcl4</i> rootstocks produced more DCL2-dependent 22-nucleotide siRNAs than the wild type and showed enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic movement of PTGS to grafted shoots. Thus, along with its role in recruiting RDR6 for further amplification of PTGS, DCL2 is crucial for RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

A Viral Satellite DNA Vector (TYLCCNV) for Functional Analysis of miRNAs and siRNAs in Plants
<p>With experimental and bioinformatical methods, numerous small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), have been found in plants, and they play vital roles in various biological regulation processes. However, most of these small RNAs remain to be functionally characterized. Until now, only several viral vectors were developed to overexpress miRNAs with limited application in plants. In this study, we report a new small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> via viral satellite DNA associated with <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</i> (TYLCCNV) vector, which could highly overexpress not only artificial and endogenous miRNAs but also endogenous siRNAs in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. First, we constructed basic TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(319L) vector with widely used <i>AtMIR319a</i> backbone, but the expected photobleaching phenotype was very weak. Second, through comparing the effect of backbones (<i>AtMIR319a</i>, <i>AtMIR390a</i>, and <i>SlMIR159</i>) on specificity and significance of generating small RNAs, the <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone was optimally selected to construct the small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Third, through sRNA-Seq and Degradome-Seq, the small RNAs from <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone in TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(390) vector were confirmed to highly overexpress amiRPDS and specifically silence targeted <i>PDS</i> gene. Using this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, rapid functional analysis of endogenous miRNAs and siRNAs was carried out, including miR156 and <i>athTAS3a</i> 5′D8(+). Meanwhile, through designing corresponding artificial miRNAs, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> could also significantly silence targeted endogenous genes and show specific phenotypes, including <i>PDS</i>, <i>Su</i>, and <i>PCNA</i>. These results demonstrated that this small RNA overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> could contribute to investigating not only the function of endogenous small RNAs, but also the functional genes in plants.</p>

Increase in Endovascular Therapy in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke After the Publication of Pivotal Trials

At EVT-capable hospitals, 7.5% of all patients with ischemic stroke were treated in the third quarter of 2016, including 27.3% of the potentially eligible patients. From 2013 to 2016, case volumes nearly doubled at EVT-capable hospitals. Mean case volume per EVT-capable hospital was 37.6 per year in the last 4 quarters.

Hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier dysfunction and risk for enteric infection
<p>Obesity, diabetes, and related manifestations are associated with an enhanced, but poorly understood, risk for mucosal infection and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic inflammation. Here, we show in mouse models of obesity and diabetes that hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier permeability, through GLUT2-dependent transcriptional reprogramming of intestinal epithelial cells and alteration of tight and adherence junction integrity. Consequently, hyperglycemia-mediated barrier disruption leads to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic influx of microbial products and enhanced dissemination of enteric infection. Treatment of hyperglycemia, intestinal epithelial–specific GLUT2 deletion, or inhibition of glucose metabolism restores barrier function and bacterial containment.

Together, our results mechanistically link hyperglycemia and intestinal barrier function with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic infectious and inflammatory consequences of obesity and diabetes.</p>

Here, we show that soliton Kerr comb generation in integrated silicon nitride microresonators provides a route to high-performance chip-scale ranging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. We demonstrate dual-comb distance measurements with Allan deviations down to 12 nanometers at averaging times of 13 microseconds along with ultrafast ranging at acquisition rates of 100 megahertz, allowing for in-flight sampling of gun projectiles moving at 150 meters per second. Combining integrated soliton-comb ranging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s with chip-scale nanophotonic phased arrays could enable compact ultrafast ranging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s for emerging mass applications.</p>

Full momentum- and energy-resolved spectral function of a 2D electronic system
<p>The single-particle spectral function measures the density of electronic states in a material as a function of both momentum and energy, providing central insights into strongly correlated electron phenomena. Here we demonstrate a high-resolution method for measuring the full momentum- and energy-resolved electronic spectral function of a two-dimensional (2D) electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> embedded in a semiconductor. The technique remains operational in the presence of large externally applied magnetic fields and functions even for electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s with zero electrical conductivity or with zero electron density. Using the technique on a prototypical 2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, a GaAs quantum well, we uncover signatures of many-body effects involving electron-phonon interactions, plasmons, polarons, and a phonon analog of the vacuum Rabi splitting in atomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.</p>

Seasonal cycling in the gut microbiome of the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania
<p>Although humans have cospeciated with their gut-resident microbes, it is difficult to infer features of our ancestral microbiome. Here, we examine the microbiome profile of 350 stool samples collected longitudinally for more than a year from the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> reveal annual cyclic reconfiguration of the microbiome, in which some taxa become undetectable only to reappear in a subsequent season. Comparison of the Hadza <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> collected from 18 populations in 16 countries with varying lifestyles reveals that gut community membership corresponds to modernization: Notably, the taxa within the Hadza that are the most seasonally volatile similarly differentiate industrialized and traditional populations.

In situ architecture, function, and evolution of a contractile injection system
<p>Contractile injection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s mediate bacterial cell-cell interactions by a bacteriophage tail–like structure. In contrast to extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, the type 6 secretion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (T6SS) is defined by intracellular localization and attachment to the cytoplasmic membrane. Here we used cryo-focused ion beam milling, electron cryotomography, and functional assays to study a T6SS in <i>Amoebophilus asiaticus</i>.

Lateral baseplate interactions coordinated T6SSs in hexagonal arrays. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> mediated interactions with host membranes and may participate in phagosome escape. Evolutionary sequence analyses predicted that T6SSs are more widespread than previously thought. Our insights form the basis for understanding T6SS key concepts and exploring T6SS diversity.</p>

Chemogenetics revealed: DREADD occupancy and activation via converted clozapine
<p>The chemogenetic technology DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) is widely used for remote manipulation of neuronal activity in freely moving animals. DREADD technology posits the use of “designer receptors,” which are exclusively activated by the “designer drug” clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Nevertheless, the in vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed. CNO does not enter the brain after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic drug injections and shows low affinity for DREADDs. Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency. Upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic CNO injections, converted clozapine readily enters the brain and occupies central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>–expressed DREADDs, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic subthreshold clozapine injections induce preferential DREADD-mediated behaviors.</p>

Improving election prediction internationally
<p>This study reports the results of a multiyear program to predict direct executive elections in a variety of countries from globally pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>. We developed prediction models by means of an election <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set covering 86 countries and more than 500 elections, and a separate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> set with extensive polling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from 146 election rounds. We also participated in two live forecasting experiments. Our models correctly predicted 80 to 90% of elections in out-of-sample tests. The results suggest that global elections can be successfully modeled and that they are likely to become more predictable as more information becomes available in future elections. The results provide strong evidence for the impact of political institutions and incumbent advantage. They also provide evidence to support contentions about the importance of international linkage and aid. Direct evidence for economic indicators as predictors of election outcomes is relatively weak. The results suggest that, with some adjustments, global polling is a robust predictor of election outcomes, even in developing states. Implications of these findings after the latest U.S. presidential election are discussed.</p>

An Efficient System for <i>Ds</i> Transposon Tagging in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Transposon tagging is a powerful tool that has been widely applied in several species for insertional mutagenesis in plants. Several efforts have aimed to create transfer-DNA (T-DNA) insertional mutant populations in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a monocot plant used as a model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to study temperate cereals, but there has been a lack of research aimed at using transposon strategies. Here, we describe the application of a maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) <i>Dissociation</i> (<i>Ds</i>) transposon tagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i>. The <i>35S</i>::<i>AcTPase</i> cassette and <i>Ds</i> element were constructed within the same T-DNA and transformed into <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> plants. The <i>Ds</i> element was readily transposed to other chromosomes or to the same chromosome under the function of <i>Activator</i> (<i>Ac</i>) transposase. Through homologous chromosome synapsis, recombination, and segregation, the <i>Ds</i> element separated from the <i>Ac</i> element. We selected stable <i>Ds</i>-only plants using G418 and GFP assays and analyzed 241 T<sub>0</sub> lines, some of which were highly efficient at producing <i>Ds</i>-only progeny. Through thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR, we isolated 710 independent <i>Ds</i> flanking sequences from <i>Ds</i>-only plants. Furthermore, we identified a large collection of mutants with visible developmental phenotypes via this transposon tagging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is relatively simple and rapid in comparison to traditional T-DNA insertion strategies, because once efficiency lines are obtained they can be reused to generate more lines from nontransposed plants without the use of time-consuming tissue culture steps.</p>

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-loading pathway has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-loading types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. However, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the structure of PD has not been considered, even though it could impact permeability, and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, structure, and function using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from transmission electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was conducted for all relevant cell–cell interfaces in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-loading types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell interfaces in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-loading type. PD density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> of single interfaces, even combined with PD diameter and length <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, did not correlate with the intercellular diffusion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD substructure not visible on standard transmission electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results support a proposed passive symplasmic loading mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD structure differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-loading species.</p>

Split-TALE: A TALE-Based Two-Component System for Synthetic Biology Applications in Planta
<p>Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are bacterial Type-III effector proteins from phytopathogenic <i>Xanthomonas</i> species that act as transcription factors in plants. The modular DNA-binding domain of TALEs can be reprogrammed to target nearly any DNA sequence. Here, we designed and optimized a two-component AND-gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> for synthetic circuits in plants based on TALEs. In this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, named split-TALE (sTALE), the TALE DNA binding domain and the transcription activation domain are separated and each fused to protein interacting domains. Physical interaction of interacting domains leads to TALE-reconstitution and can be monitored by reporter gene induction. This setup was used for optimization of the sTALE scaffolds, which result in an AND-gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. We also provide a toolkit of ready-to-use vectors and single modules compatible with Golden Gate cloning and MoClo syntax.

Selective Targeting of Mobile mRNAs to Plasmodesmata for Cell-to-Cell Movement
<p>Many plant mRNAs move from cell to cell or long distance to execute non-cell-autonomous functions. These mobile mRNAs traffic through the phloem to regulate many developmental processes, but despite the burgeoning discovery of mobile mRNAs, little is known about the mechanism underlying the intracellular sorting of these mRNAs. Here, we exploited a fluorescence-based mRNA labeling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, using the bacteriophage coat protein MS2, fused to GFP (MS2-GFP) and an MS2 recognition site in the RNA of interest, to visualize the intracellular trafficking of mobile mRNAs in living plant cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We first improved this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> by using the nuclear localization sequence from FD, which substantially reduced the fluorescent background of MS2-GFP in the cytoplasm. The modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> allowed us to observe the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci dependent on MS2-binding sites. Coexpressing the MS2-GFP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with a virus movement protein, which is a plasmodesmata (PD)-localized nonspecific RNA-binding protein, targeted cytoplasmic fluorescent foci to the PD, suggesting that the cytoplasmic fluorescent foci contain mRNA and MS2-GFP. Our ex vivo RNA imaging revealed that mobile but not nonmobile mRNAs were selectively targeted to PD. Real-time images of intracellular translocation revealed that the translocation of mRNA and organelles in the transvacuolar strands may be governed by the same mechanism. Our study suggests that PD targeting of mRNA is a selective step in determining mRNA cell-to-cell movement of mRNAs.</p>

A New Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus Allows Large Protein Overexpression for Rapid Function Analysis
<p>Understanding the genetic and molecular bases of gene function is of increasing importance to harness their potential to produce plants with novel traits. One important objective is the improvement of plant productivity to meet future demands in food crop production. Gene function is mostly characterized through overexpression or silencing in transgenic plants. This approach is a lengthy procedure, especially in cereals. Plant viral expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s can be used for rapid expression of proteins. However, current <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s have a small cargo capacity and have mostly been used for gene silencing. Here, a four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with high cargo capacity was constructed for the rapid and stable expression of recombinant proteins in different plant species, allowing function analyses at different stages of development. Fluorescent marker proteins are expressed at high levels within 1 week, and a proof of efficient function analysis is shown using the aluminum malate transporter1 gene. In addition to the ability of gene cotransformation, this work demonstrates that the four-component barley stripe mosaic virus-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> allows the overexpression of cDNAs of up to 2,100 nucleotides (encoding a protein of ∼78 kD), thereby providing an invaluable tool to accelerate functional genomics and proteomic research in monocot and dicot species.</p>

Biochemical Principles and Functional Aspects of Pipecolic Acid Biosynthesis in Plant Immunity
<p>The nonprotein amino acid pipecolic acid (Pip) regulates plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired resistance and basal immunity to bacterial pathogen infection. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the lysine (Lys) aminotransferase AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1 (ALD1) mediates the pathogen-induced accumulation of Pip in inoculated and distal leaf tissue. Here, we show that ALD1 transfers the α-amino group of <sc>l</sc>-Lys to acceptor oxoacids. Combined mass spectrometric and infrared spectroscopic analyses of in vitro assays and plant extracts indicate that the final product of the ALD1-catalyzed reaction is enaminic 2,3-dehydropipecolic acid (DP), whose formation involves consecutive transamination, cyclization, and isomerization steps. Besides <sc>l</sc>-Lys, recombinant ALD1 transaminates <sc>l</sc>-methionine, <sc>l</sc>-leucine, diaminopimelate, and several other amino acids to generate oxoacids or derived products in vitro. However, detailed in planta analyses suggest that the biosynthesis of 2,3-DP from <sc>l</sc>-Lys is the major in vivo function of ALD1. Since <i>ald1</i> mutant plants are able to convert exogenous 2,3-DP into Pip, their Pip deficiency relies on the inability to form the 2,3-DP intermediate. The Arabidopsis reductase ornithine cyclodeaminase/μ-crystallin, alias <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>IC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE-DEFICIENT4 (SARD4), converts ALD1-generated 2,3-DP into Pip in vitro. SARD4 significantly contributes to the production of Pip in pathogen-inoculated leaves but is not the exclusive reducing enzyme involved in Pip biosynthesis. Functional <i>SARD4</i> is required for proper basal immunity to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Although <i>SARD4</i> knockout plants show greatly reduced accumulation of Pip in leaves distal to <i>P. syringae</i> inoculation, they display a considerable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired resistance response. This suggests a triggering function of locally accumulating Pip for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic resistance induction.</p>

Discovery and Characterization of the 3-Hydroxyacyl-ACP Dehydratase Component of the Plant Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Synthase System
<p>We report the characterization of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) 3-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein dehydratase (mtHD) component of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthase (mtFAS) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, encoded by AT5G60335. The mitochondrial localization and catalytic capability of mtHD were demonstrated with a green fluorescent protein transgenesis experiment and by in vivo complementation and in vitro enzymatic assays. RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown lines with reduced <i>mtHD</i> expression exhibit traits typically associated with mtFAS mutants, namely a miniaturized morphological appearance, reduced lipoylation of lipoylated proteins, and altered metabolomes consistent with the reduced catalytic activity of lipoylated enzymes. These alterations are reversed when <i>mthd-rnai</i> mutant plants are grown in a 1% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, indicating the link between mtFAS and photorespiratory deficiency due to the reduced lipoylation of glycine decarboxylase. In vivo biochemical feeding experiments illustrate that sucrose and glycolate are the metabolic modulators that mediate the alterations in morphology and lipid accumulation. In addition, both <i>mthd-rnai</i> and <i>mtkas</i> mutants exhibit reduced accumulation of 3-hydroxytetradecanoic acid (i.e. a hallmark of lipid A-like molecules) and abnormal chloroplastic starch granules; these changes are not reversible by the 1% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, demonstrating two novel mtFAS functions that are independent of photorespiration. Finally, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that <i>mthd-rnai</i> and <i>mtkas</i> mutants are nearly equivalent to each other in altering the transcriptome, and these analyses further identified genes whose expression is affected by a functional mtFAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> but independent of photorespiratory deficiency. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> demonstrate the nonredundant nature of the mtFAS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, which contributes unique lipid components needed to support plant cell structure and metabolism.</p>

The GET System Inserts the Tail-Anchored Protein, SYP72, into Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes

The role of the GET <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in Arabidopsis was investigated by monitoring the membrane insertion of a tail-anchored protein, SYP72, a syntaxin.

The Arabidopsis GET <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> functioned in vivo to insert TA proteins into ER membranes as demonstrated by the fact that the YFP-tagged SYP72 localized to the ER in wild-type plants but accumulated as cytoplasmic inclusions in <i>get1</i>, <i>get3</i>, or <i>get4</i> mutants. The GET mutants <i>get1</i> and <i>get3</i> were less tolerant of ER stress agents and showed symptoms of ER stress even under unstressed conditions.

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A deeper understanding of the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is crucial in tailoring digestibility without sacrificing grain quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were identified through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched starch structure from grains of a 320 <i>indica</i> rice diversity panel using genotyping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from the high-density rice array. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s genetics approach that interrelates starch structure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network identified known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound Starch Synthase I</i> was identified along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch structure with starch digestibility by determining the kinetics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch structure with estimated digestibility kinetics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s genetics, and digestibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch structure in rice through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the digestibility of rice grain, thus offering rice consumers a new diet-based intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of seed traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, seed mass is generally regarded to be key for seedling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong>, often termed seed size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single seeds, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i>Seeder, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual seeds of very different sizes. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> consists of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual seeds are two-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from projections, three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">data</span></strong> from volumetric measures, and mass, from which seed density is also calculated. Each seed is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine seed-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating seeds of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped seeds of rapeseed, correlations between the projected area and the mass of seeds were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for seed mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated seed phenotyping on a single-seed basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including seed classification, seed sorting, and assessment of seed quality.</p>

The Proteasome Acts as a Hub for Plant Immunity and Is Targeted by <i>Pseudomonas</i> Type III Effectors
<p>Recent evidence suggests that the ubiquitin-proteasome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is involved in several aspects of plant immunity and that a range of plant pathogens subvert the ubiquitin-proteasome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> to enhance their virulence. Here, we show that proteasome activity is strongly induced during basal defense in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Mutant lines of the proteasome subunits <i>RPT2a</i> and <i>RPN12a</i> support increased bacterial growth of virulent <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 (<i>Pst</i>) and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>maculicola</i> ES4326. Both proteasome subunits are required for pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity responses. Analysis of bacterial growth after a secondary infection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves revealed that the establishment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired resistance (SAR) is impaired in proteasome mutants, suggesting that the proteasome also plays an important role in defense priming and SAR. In addition, we show that <i>Pst</i> inhibits proteasome activity in a type III secretion-dependent manner. A screen for type III effector proteins from <i>Pst</i> for their ability to interfere with proteasome activity revealed HopM1, HopAO1, HopA1, and HopG1 as putative proteasome inhibitors. Biochemical characterization of HopM1 by mass spectrometry indicates that HopM1 interacts with several E3 ubiquitin ligases and proteasome subunits. This supports the hypothesis that HopM1 associates with the proteasome, leading to its inhibition.

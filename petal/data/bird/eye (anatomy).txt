Phagocytosed photoreceptor outer segments activate mTORC1 in the retinal pigment epithelium
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l pigment epithelium (RPE) transports nutrients and metabolites between the microvascular bed that maintains the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> neurons. The RPE removes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> outer segments (POS) by receptor-mediated phagocytosis, a process that peaks in the morning. Uptake and degradation of POS initiates signaling cascades in the RPE. Upstream stimuli from various metabolic activities converge on mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), and aberrant mTORC1 signaling is implicated in aging and age-related degeneration of the RPE. We measured mTORC1-mediated responses to RPE phagocytosis in vivo and in vitro. During the morning burst of POS shedding, there was transient activation of mTORC1-mediated signaling in the RPE. POS activated mTORC1 through lysosome-independent mechanisms, and engulfed POS served as a docking platform for mTORC1 assembly. The identification of POS as endogenous stimuli of mTORC1 in the RPE provides a mechanistic link underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>-RPE interaction in the outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>.</p>

Thyroid hormone signaling specifies cone subtypes in human retinal organoids
<p>The mechanisms underlying specification of neuronal subtypes within the human nervous system are largely unknown. The blue (S), green (M), and red (L) cones of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> enable high-acuity daytime and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color vis</span></strong>ion. To determine the mechanism that controls S versus L/M fates, we studied the differentiation of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l organoids. Organoids and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>s have similar distributions, expression profiles, and morphologies of cone subtypes. S cones are specified first, followed by L/M cones, and thyroid hormone signaling controls this temporal switch. Dynamic expression of thyroid hormone–degrading and –activating proteins within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> ensures low signaling early to specify S cones and high signaling late to produce L/M cones. This work establishes organoids as a model for determining mechanisms of human development with promising utility for therapeutics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong> repair.</p>

iPTF16geu: A multiply imaged, gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova
<p>We report the discovery of a multiply imaged, gravitationally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lens</span></strong>ed type Ia supernova, iPTF16geu (SN 2016geu), at redshift <i>z</i> = 0.409. This phenomenon was identified because the light from the stellar explosion was magnified more than 50 times by the curvature of space around matter in an intervening galaxy. We used high-spatial-resolution observations to resolve four images of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lens</span></strong>ed supernova, approximately 0.3 arc seconds from the center of the foreground galaxy. The observations probe a physical scale of ~1 kiloparsec, smaller than is typical in other studies of extragalactic gravitational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lens</span></strong>ing. The large magnification and symmetric image configuration imply close alignment between the lines of sight to the supernova and to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lens</span></strong>. The relative magnifications of the four images provide evidence for substructures in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lens</span></strong>ing galaxy.</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three cone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> classes for colour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong>, yet many birds, reptiles and shallow-water fish are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. Screening pigments, which narrow the spectrum of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s in birds and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water fish that, like humans, lack screening pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong> in humans and fish by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that fish require four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that fish cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of fish cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in fish has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water fish might possess fewer than four cone classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction.</p>

Glia relay differentiation cues to coordinate neuronal development in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Neuronal birth and specification must be coordinated across the developing brain to generate the neurons that constitute neural circuits. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> visual system to investigate how development is coordinated to establish retinotopy, a feature of all visual systems. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s achieve retinotopy by inducing their target field in the optic lobe, the lamina neurons, with a secreted differentiation cue, epidermal growth factor (EGF). We find that communication between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s and lamina cells requires a signaling relay through glia. In response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>-EGF, glia produce insulin-like peptides, which induce lamina neuronal differentiation. Our study identifies a role for glia in coordinating neuronal development across distinct brain regions, thus reconciling the timing of column assembly with that of delayed differentiation, as well as the spatiotemporal pattern of lamina neuron differentiation.</p>

Laminins containing the β2 and γ3 chains regulate astrocyte migration and angiogenesis in the retina
<p>Pathologies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l blood vessels are among the major causes of blindness worldwide. A key cell type that regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l vascular development is the astrocyte. Generated extrinsically to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>, astrocytes migrate into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> through the optic nerve head. Even though there is a strong correlation between astrocyte distribution and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l vascular development, the factors that guide astrocytes into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> remain unclear. In this study, we show that astrocytes migrate within a laminin-containing basement membrane - the inner limiting membrane. Genetic deletion of the laminin β2 and γ3 chains affects astrocyte migration and spatial distribution. We show that laminins act as haptotactic factors <i>in vitro</i> in an isoform-specific manner, inducing astrocyte migration and promoting astrocyte differentiation. The addition of exogenous laminins to laminin-null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l explants rescues astrocyte migration and spatial patterning. Furthermore, we show that the loss of laminins reduces β1 integrin expression in astrocytes. Culturing laminin-null <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l astrocytes on laminin substrates restores focal localization of β1 integrin. Finally, we show that laminins containing β2 and γ3 chains regulate subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l blood vessel growth and maintain vascular integrity. These <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> studies demonstrate clearly that laminins containing β2 and γ3 chains are indispensable for migration and spatial organization of astrocytes and that they play a crucial role during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l angiogenesis <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

Inflammation, necrosis, and the kinase RIP3 are key mediators of AAG-dependent alkylation-induced retinal degeneration
<p>DNA-alkylating agents are commonly used to kill cancer cells, but the base excision repair (BER) pathway they trigger can also produce toxic intermediates that cause tissue damage, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l degeneration (RD). Apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death, is assumed to be the main mechanism of this alkylation-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> (PR) cell death in RD. Here, we studied the involvement of necroptosis (another programmed cell death process) and inflammation in alkylation-induced RD. Male mice exposed to a methylating agent exhibited a reduced number of PR cell rows, active gliosis, and cytokine induction and macrophage infiltration in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>. Dying PRs exhibited a necrotic morphology, increased 8-hydroxyguanosine abundance (an oxidative damage marker), and overexpression of the necroptosis-associated genes <i>Rip1</i> and <i>Rip3</i>. The activity of PARP1, which mediates BER, cell death, and inflammation, was increased in PR cells and associated with the release of proinflammatory chemokine HMGB1 from PR nuclei. Mice lacking the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 exhibited more severe RD, whereas deficiency of RIP3 (also known as RIPK3) conferred partial protection. Female mice were partially protected from alkylation-induced RD, showing reduced necroptosis and inflammation compared to males. PRs in mice lacking the BER-initiating DNA glycosylase AAG did not exhibit alkylation-induced necroptosis or inflammation. Our findings show that AAG-initiated BER at alkylated DNA bases induces sex-dependent RD primarily by triggering necroptosis and activating an inflammatory response that amplifies the original damage and, furthermore, reveal new potential targets to prevent this side effect of chemotherapy.</p>

Using neuroscience to develop artificial intelligence
<p>When the mathematician Alan Turing posed the question “Can machines think?” in the first line of his seminal 1950 paper that ushered in the quest for artificial intelligence (AI) (<i>1</i>), the only known systems carrying out complex computations were biological nervous systems. It is not surprising, therefore, that scientists in the nascent field of AI turned to brain circuits as a source for guidance. One path that was taken since the early attempts to perform intelligent computation by brain-like circuits (<i>2</i>), and which led recently to remarkable successes, can be described as a highly reductionist approach to model cortical circuitry. In its basic current form, known as a “deep network” (or deep net) architecture, this brain-inspired model is built from successive layers of neuron-like elements, connected by adjustable weights, called “synapses” after their biological counterparts (<i>3</i>). The application of deep nets and related methods to AI systems has been transformative. They proved superior to previously known methods in central areas of AI research, including computer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong>, speech recognition and production, and playing complex games. Practical applications are already in broad use, in areas such as computer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong> and speech and text translation, and large-scale efforts are under way in many other areas. Here, I discuss how additional aspects of brain circuitry could supply cues for guiding network models toward broader aspects of cognition and general AI.</p>

A method for single-neuron chronic recording from the retina in awake mice
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>, which processes visual information and sends it to the brain, is an excellent model for studying neural circuitry. It has been probed extensively ex vivo but has been refractory to chronic in vivo electrophysiology. We report a nonsurgical method to achieve chronically stable in vivo recordings from single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l ganglion cells (RGCs) in awake mice. We developed a noncoaxial intravitreal injection scheme in which injected mesh electronics unrolls inside the eye and conformally coats the highly curved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> without compromising normal eye functions. The method allows 16-channel recordings from multiple types of RGCs with stable responses to visual stimuli for at least 2 weeks, and reveals circadian rhythms in RGC responses over multiple day/night cycles.</p>

Glia put visual map in sync
<p>Watching a fireworks display is a breathtaking experience. As explosions pattern the sky, the visual system must capture information about the time-varying positions, colors, and contrasts of myriad spots of light. This testament to high-acuity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong> necessitates the development of neural circuits that map visual space. To generate this retinotopy (visual mapping), neurons must differentiate and connect to their synaptic targets with both spatial and temporal precision. How is this achieved? The molecules that regulate neuronal differentiation have been described in detail, as have the cues that allow differentiated neurons to reach and choose their synaptic partners (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, the mechanisms that coordinate neuronal specification with the development of retinotopic circuit wiring have remained elusive. On page 886 of this issue, Fernandes <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) demonstrate that in the visual system of flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s use glial cells as intermediaries to communicate with their neural targets to generate retinotopic circuits.</p>

Seismic constraints on caldera dynamics from the 2015 Axial Seamount eruption

The ring fault <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accommod</span></strong>ated deflation during the eruption and provided a pathway for a dike that propagated south and north beneath the caldera’s east wall. Once north of the caldera, the eruption stepped westward, and a dike propagated along the extensional north rift.</p>

Phytochrome B integrates light and temperature signals in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Ambient temperature regulates many aspects of plant growth and development, but its sensors are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the phytochrome B (phyB) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> participates in temperature perception through its temperature-dependent reversion from the active Pfr state to the inactive Pr state. Increased rates of thermal reversion upon exposing <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings to warm environments reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool of phyB and the size of the associated nuclear bodies, even in daylight. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and temperature revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals. We therefore propose that in addition to its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> functions, phyB is a temperature sensor in plants.</p>

Pivotal Roles of Cryptochromes 1a and 2 in Tomato Development and Physiology
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-containing blue/UVA light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s that regulate various plant light-induced physiological processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), cryptochromes mediate de-etiolation, photoperiodic control of flowering, entrainment of the circadian clock, cotyledon opening and expansion, anthocyanin accumulation, and root growth. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), cryptochromes are encoded by a multigene family, comprising <i>CRY1a</i>, <i>CRY1b</i>, <i>CRY2</i>, and <i>CRY3</i>. We have previously reported the phenotypes of tomato <i>cry1a</i> mutants and <i>CRY2</i> overexpressing plants. Here, we report the isolation by targeting induced local lesions in genomes, of a tomato <i>cry2</i> knock-out mutant, its introgression in the indeterminate Moneymaker background, and the phenotypes of <i>cry1a</i>/<i>cry2</i> single and double mutants. The <i>cry1a</i>/<i>cry2</i> mutant showed phenotypes similar to its Arabidopsis counterpart (long hypocotyls in white and blue light), but also several additional features such as increased seed weight and internode length, enhanced hypocotyl length in red light, inhibited primary root growth under different light conditions, anticipation of flowering under long-day conditions, and alteration of the phase of circadian leaf movements. Both cry1a and cry2 control the levels of photosynthetic pigments in leaves, but cry2 has a predominant role in fruit pigmentation. Metabolites of the sterol, tocopherol, quinone, and sugar classes are differentially accumulated in <i>cry1a</i> and <i>cry2</i> leaves and fruits. These results demonstrate a pivotal role of cryptochromes in controlling tomato development and physiology. The manipulation of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s represents a powerful tool to influence important agronomic traits such as flowering time and fruit quality.</p>

Perception of Sunflecks by the UV-B Photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8
<p>Sunflecks, transient patches of light that penetrate through gaps in the canopy and transiently interrupt shade, are eco-physiologically and agriculturally important sources of energy for carbon gain, but our molecular understanding of how plant organs perceive and respond to sunflecks through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s remains limited. The UV-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong> UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8) is a recent addition to the list of plant photosensory receptors, and we have made considerable advances in our understanding of the physiology and molecular mechanisms of action of UVR8 and its signaling pathway. However, the function of UVR8 in the natural environment is poorly understood. Here, we show that the UVR8 dimer/monomer ratio responds quantitatively and reversibly to the intensity of sunflecks that interrupt shade in the field. Sunflecks reduced hypocotyl growth and increased <i>CHALCONE SYNTHASE</i> (<i>CHS</i>) and <i>ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5</i> gene expression and CHS protein abundance in wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings, but the <i>uvr8</i> mutant was impaired in these responses. UVR8 was also required for normal nuclear dynamics of CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1. We propose that UVR8 plays an important role in the plant perception of and response to sunflecks.</p>

Octopaminergic modulation of the visual flight speed regulator of <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that flies' sensitivity to large-field optic flow is increased by the release of octopamine during flight. This increase in gain presumably enhances visually mediated behaviors such as the active regulation of forward speed, a process that involves the comparison of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong>-based estimate of velocity with an internal set point. To determine where in the neural circuit this comparison is made, we selectively silenced the octopamine neurons in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i>, and examined the effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong>-based velocity regulation in free-flying flies. We found that flies with inactivated octopamine neurons accelerated more slowly in response to visual motion than control flies, but maintained nearly the same baseline flight speed. Our results are parsimonious with a circuit architecture in which the internal control signal is injected into the visual motion pathway upstream of the interneuron network that estimates groundspeed.</p>

Extramacrochaetae imposes order on the <i>Drosophila</i> eye by refining the activity of the Hedgehog signaling gradient
<p>The compound eye of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is configured by a differentiating wave, the morphogenetic furrow, that sweeps across the eye imaginal disc and transforms thousands of undifferentiated cells into a precisely ordered repetitive array of 800 ommatidia. The initiation of the furrow at the posterior margin of the epithelium and its subsequent movement across the eye field is controlled by the activity of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Differentiating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoreceptor</span></strong>s that lie behind the furrow produce and secrete the Hh morphogen, which is captured by cells within the furrow itself. This leads to the stabilization of the full-length form of the zinc-finger transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci<sup>155</sup>), the main effector of Hh signaling. Ci<sup>155</sup> functions as a transcriptional activator of a number of downstream targets, including <i>decapentaplegic</i> (<i>dpp</i>), a TGFβ homolog. In this report, we describe a mechanism that is in place within the fly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> to limit Hh pathway activity within and ahead of the furrow. We demonstrate that the helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein Extramacrochaetae (Emc) regulates Ci<sup>155</sup> levels. Loss of <i>emc</i> leads to an increase in Ci<sup>155</sup> levels, nuclear migration, apical cell constriction and an acceleration of the furrow. We find that these roles are distinct from the bHLH protein Hairy (H), which we show restricts <i>atonal</i> (<i>ato</i>) expression ahead of the furrow. Secondary furrow initiation along the dorsal and ventral margins is blocked by the activity of the Wingless (Wg) pathway. We also show that Emc regulates and cooperates with Wg signaling to inhibit lateral furrow initiation.</p>

Can bees see at a glance?
<p>Primates can analyse visual scenes extremely rapidly, making accurate decisions for presentation times of only 20 ms. We asked whether bumblebees, despite having potentially more limited processing power, could similarly detect and discriminate visual patterns presented for durations of 100 ms or less. Bumblebees detected stimuli and discriminated between differently oriented and coloured stimuli when presented as briefly as 25 ms but failed to identify ecologically relevant shapes (predatory spiders on flowers) even when presented for 100 ms. This suggests an important difference between primate and insect visual processing, so that while primates can capture entire visual scenes ‘at a glance’, insects might have to rely on continuous online sampling of the world around them, using a process of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong>, which requires longer integration times.</p>

Olfactory memories are intensity specific in larval <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Learning can rely on stimulus quality, stimulus intensity, or a combination of these. Regarding olfaction, the coding of odour quality is often proposed to be combinatorial along the olfactory pathway, and working hypotheses are available concerning short-term associative memory trace formation of odour quality. However, it is less clear how odour intensity is coded, and whether olfactory memory traces include information about the intensity of the learnt odour. Using odour–sugar associative conditioning in larval <i>Drosophila</i>, we first describe the dose–effect curves of learnability across odour intensities for four different odours (<i>n</i>-amyl acetate, 3-octanol, 1-octen-3-ol and benzaldehyde). We then chose odour intensities such that larvae were trained at an intermediate odour intensity, but were tested for retention with either that trained intermediate odour intensity, or with respectively higher or lower intensities. We observed a specificity of retention for the trained intensity for all four odours used. This adds to the appreciation of the richness in ‘content’ of olfactory short-term memory traces, even in a system as simple as larval <i>Drosophila</i>, and to define the demands on computational models of associative olfactory memory trace formation. We suggest two kinds of circuit architecture that have the potential to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accommod</span></strong>ate intensity learning, and discuss how they may be implemented in the insect brain.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accommod</span></strong>ate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

Quantification of the ossification of the lateral cuneiform in the feet of young children with unilateral congenital talipes equinovarus
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>After the initial correction of congenital talipes equinovarus   (CTEV) using the Ponseti method, a subsequent dynamic deformity   is often managed by transfer of the tendon of tibialis anterior   (TATT) to the lateral cuneiform.

A novel mouse model of Warburg Micro syndrome reveals roles for RAB18 in eye development and organisation of the neuronal cytoskeleton
<p>Mutations in <i>RAB18</i> have been shown to cause the heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM). Individuals with WARBM present with a range of clinical symptoms, including ocular and neurological abnormalities. However, the underlying cellular and molecular pathogenesis of the disorder remains unclear, largely owing to the lack of any robust animal models that phenocopy both the ocular and neurological features of the disease. We report here the generation and characterisation of a novel <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse model of WARBM. <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice are viable and fertile. They present with congenital nuclear cataracts and atonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pupil</span></strong>s, recapitulating the characteristic ocular features that are associated with WARBM. Additionally, <i>Rab18</i>-mutant cells exhibit an increase in lipid droplet size following treatment with oleic acid. Lipid droplet abnormalities are a characteristic feature of cells taken from WARBM individuals, as well as cells taken from individuals with other neurodegenerative conditions. Neurological dysfunction is also apparent in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice, including progressive weakness of the hind limbs. We show that the neurological defects are, most likely, not caused by gross perturbations in synaptic vesicle recycling in the central or peripheral nervous system. Rather, loss of <i>Rab18</i> is associated with widespread disruption of the neuronal cytoskeleton, including abnormal accumulations of neurofilament and microtubule proteins in synaptic terminals, and gross disorganisation of the cytoskeleton in peripheral nerves. Global proteomic profiling of peripheral nerves in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice reveals significant alterations in several core molecular pathways that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in neurons. The apparent similarities between the WARBM phenotype and the phenotype that we describe here indicate that the <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse provides an important platform for investigation of the disease pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions.</p>

Complexes of Usher proteins preassemble at the endoplasmic reticulum and are required for trafficking and ER homeostasis
<p>Usher syndrome (USH), the leading cause of hereditary combined hearing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vision</span></strong> loss, is characterized by sensorineural deafness and progressive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l degeneration. Mutations in several different genes produce USH, but the proximal cause of sensory cell death remains mysterious. We adapted a proximity ligation assay to analyze associations among three of the USH proteins, Cdh23, Harmonin and Myo7aa, and the microtubule-based transporter Ift88 in zebrafish inner ear mechanosensory hair cells. We found that the proteins are in close enough proximity to form complexes and that these complexes preassemble at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Defects in any one of the three USH proteins disrupt formation and trafficking of the complex and result in diminished levels of the other proteins, generalized trafficking defects and ER stress that triggers apoptosis. ER stress, thus, contributes to sensory hair cell loss and provides a new target to explore for protective therapies for USH.</p>

Mechanisms of <i>prickle1a</i> function in zebrafish epilepsy and retinal neurogenesis
<p>Epilepsy is a complex neurological disorder characterized by unprovoked seizures. The etiology is heterogeneous with both genetic and environmental causes. Genes that regulate neurotransmitters and ion channels in the central nervous system have been associated with epilepsy. However, a recent screening in human epilepsy patients identified mutations in the <i>PRICKLE1</i> (<i>PK1</i>) locus, highlighting a potentially novel mechanism underlying seizures. PK1 is a core component of the planar cell polarity network that regulates tissue polarity. Zebrafish studies have shown that Pk1 coordinates cell movement, neuronal migration and axonal outgrowth during embryonic development. Yet how dysfunction of Pk1 relates to epilepsy is unknown. To address the mechanism underlying epileptogenesis, we used zebrafish to characterize Pk1a function and epilepsy-related mutant forms. We show that knockdown of <i>pk1a</i> activity sensitizes zebrafish larva to a convulsant drug. To model defects in the central nervous system, we used the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong> and found that <i>pk1a</i> knockdown induces neurite outgrowth defects; yet visual function is maintained. Furthermore, we characterized the functional and biochemical properties of the PK1 mutant forms identified in human patients. Functional analyses demonstrate that the wild-type Pk1a partially suppresses the gene knockdown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">retina</span></strong>l defects but not the mutant forms. Biochemical analysis reveals increased ubiquitylation of one mutant form and decreased translational efficiency of another mutant form compared with the wild-type Pk1a. Taken together, our results indicate that mutation of human PK1 could lead to defects in neurodevelopment and signal processing, providing insight into seizure predisposition in these patients.</p>

Chemical responses to modified lignin composition in tension wood of hybrid poplar (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i>)
<p>The effect of altering the expression level of the <i>F5H</i> gene was investigated in three wood tissues (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>, opposite and tension wood) in 1-year-old hybrid poplar clone 717 (<i>Populus tremula × Populus alba</i> L.), containing the <i>F5H</i> gene under the control of the <i>C4H</i> promoter. Elevated expression of the <i>F5H</i> gene in poplar has been previously reported to increase the percent syringyl content of lignin. The wild-type and three transgenic lines were inclined 45° for 3 months to induce tension wood formation. Tension and opposite wood from inclined trees, along with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> wood from control trees, were analyzed separately for carbohydrates, lignin, cellulose crystallinity and microfibril angle (MFA). In the wild-type poplar, the lignin in tension wood contained a significantly higher percentage of syringyl than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> wood or opposite wood. However, there was no significant difference in the percent syringyl content of the three wood types within each of the transgenic lines. Increasing the <i>F5H</i> gene expression caused an increase in the percent syringyl content and a slight decrease in the total lignin in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> wood. In tension wood, the addition of a gelatinous layer in the fiber walls resulted in a consistently lower percentage of total lignin in the tissue. Acid-soluble lignin was observed to increase by up to 2.3-fold in the transgenic lines. Compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> wood and opposite wood, cell wall crystallinity in tension wood was higher and the MFA was smaller, as expected, with no evidence of an effect from modifying the syringyl monomer ratio. Tension wood in all the lines contained consistently higher total sugar and glucose percentages when compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> wood within the respective lines. However, both sugar and glucose percentages were lower in the tension wood of transgenic lines when compared with the tension wood of wild-type trees. E<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ating the response of trees with altered syringyl content to gravity will improve our understanding of the changes in cell wall chemistry and ultrastructural properties of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>, opposite and tension wood in plants.</p>

Improving the accuracy of synovial fluid analysis in the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection with simple and inexpensive biomarkers
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to increase the diagnostic accuracy   of the analysis of synovial fluid in the differentiation of prosthetic   joint infection (PJI) by the addition of inexpensive biomarkers   such as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), adenosine deaminase   (ADA), alpha-2-macrogloblulin (α2M) and procalcitonin.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between January 2013 and December 2015, synovial fluid and removed   implants were requested from 143 revision total joint arthroplasties.

Long-Term Potassium Monitoring and Dynamics in Heart Failure and Risk of Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The prognostic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e of long-term potassium monitoring and dynamics in heart failure has not been characterized completely. We sought to determine the association between serum potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es collected at follow-up with all-cause mortality in a prospective and consecutive cohort of patients discharged from a previous acute heart failure admission.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Serum potassium was measured at every physician-patient encounter, including hospital admissions and ambulatory settings. The multivariable-adjusted association of serum potassium with mortality was assessed by using comprehensive state-of-the-art regression methods that can accommodate time-dependent exposure modeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study sample included 2164 patients with a total of 16 116 potassium observations. Mean potassium at discharge was 4.3±0.48 mEq/L. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L), normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (>5 mEq/L) were observed at the index admission in 77 (3.6%), 1965 (90.8%), and 122 (5.6%) patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 2.8 years (range, 0.03–12.8 years), 1090 patients died (50.4%). On a continuous scale, the multivariable-adjusted association of potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es and mortality revealed a nonlinear association (U-shaped) with higher risk at both ends of its distribution (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.001). Likewise, the adjusted hazard ratios for hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, normokalemia as reference, were 2.35 (95% confidence interval, 1.40–3.93; <i>P</i>=0.001) and 1.55 (95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.16; <i>P</i>=0.011), respectively (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.0003).

Prognostic Value of Coronary Artery Calcium in the PROMISE Study (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an established predictor of future major adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals. However, limited data exist as to how CAC compares with functional testing (FT) in estimating prognosis in symptomatic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for E<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain (or dyspnea) and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease were randomized to FT (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or anatomic testing. We e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ated those who underwent CAC testing as part of the anatomic e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ation (n=4209) and compared that with results of FT (n=4602). We stratified CAC and FT results as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> or mildly, moderately, or severely ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> (for CAC: 0, 1–99 Agatston score [AS], 100–400 AS, and >400 AS, respectively; for FT: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>, mild=late positive treadmill, moderate=early positive treadmill or single-vessel ischemia, and severe=large ischemic region ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ity). The primary end point was all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalization over a median follow-up of 26.1 months.

Interactions between brain and spinal cord mediate value effects in nocebo hyperalgesia
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e information about a drug, such as the price tag, can strongly affect its therapeutic effect. We discovered that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e information influences adverse treatment outcomes in humans even in the absence of an active substance. Labeling an inert treatment as expensive medication led to stronger nocebo hyperalgesia than labeling it as cheap medication. This effect was mediated by neural interactions between cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. In particular, activity in the prefrontal cortex mediated the effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e on nocebo hyperalgesia. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e furthermore modulated coupling between prefrontal areas, brainstem, and spinal cord, which might represent a flexible mechanism through which higher-cognitive representations, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e, can modulate early pain processing.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin concentration. The maximum COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e was 10.4% of total hemoglobin concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in sodium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, sodium intake was often estimated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in sodium intake and sodium excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine samples on the relation between sodium intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine sample between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection during a 17-year follow-up. Sodium intake was estimated with a single baseline collection and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e of samples collected during a 1-, 5-, and 15-year follow-up. We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between sodium intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine samples. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e 24-hour sodium excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88). However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in sodium intake with long-term estimations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of sodium intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e was used, respectively. Consequently, hazard ratios for cardiorenal outcome changed up to 85% with the use of sodium intake estimations from short-term (1-year) and long-term (5-year) follow-up instead of baseline estimations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Relative to a single baseline 24-hour sodium measurement, the use of subsequent 24-hour urine samples resulted in different estimations of an individual’s sodium intake, whereas population <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>es remained similar.

Mapping the stochastic sequence of individual ligand-receptor binding events to cellular activation: T cells act on the rare events
<p>T cell receptor (TCR) binding to agonist peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) triggers signaling events that initiate T cell responses. This system is remarkably sensitive, requiring only a few binding events to successfully activate a cellular response. On <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e, activating pMHC ligands exhibit mean dwell times of at least a few seconds when bound to the TCR. However, a T cell accumulates pMHC-TCR interactions as a stochastic series of discrete, single-molecule binding events whose individual dwell times are broadly distributed. With activation occurring in response to only a handful of such binding events, individual cells are unlikely to experience the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e binding time. Here, we mapped the ensemble of pMHC-TCR binding events in space and time while simultaneously monitoring cellular activation. Our findings revealed that T cell activation hinges on rare, long–dwell time binding events that are an order of magnitude longer than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e agonist pMHC-TCR dwell time. Furthermore, we observed that short pMHC-TCR binding events that were spatially correlated and temporally sequential led to cellular activation. These observations indicate that T cell antigen discrimination likely occurs by sensing the tail end of the pMHC-TCR binding dwell time distribution rather than its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e properties.</p>

Atmospheric <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C changes during the last glacial period from Hulu Cave

The latter correspond to <sup>14</sup>C ages 5200 years less than calibrated ages and correlate with the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion followed by Heinrich Stadial 4. Millennial-scale variations are largely attributable to Earth’s magnetic field changes and in part to climate-related changes in the oceanic carbon cycle. A progressive shift to lower <sup>14</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es between 25,000 and 11,000 years ago is likely related, in part, to progressively increasing ocean ventilation rates.</p>

Heart rate as a predictor of metabolic rate in heterothermic bats
<p>While heart rate (<i>f</i><sub>H</sub>) has been used as an indicator of energy expenditure, quantitative data showing the relationship between these variables are only available for normothermic animals. To determine whether <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> also predicts oxygen consumption ([Formula]) during torpor, we simultaneously measured [Formula], <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and subcutaneous body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>sub</sub>) of a hibernator, Gould's long-eared bats (<i>Nyctophilus gouldi</i>, 9 g, <i>N</i>=18), at ambient temperatures (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>) between 0 and 25°C. At rest, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of normothermic resting bats was negatively correlated with <i>T</i><sub>a</sub>, with maximum <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> of 803 beats min<sup>−1</sup> (<i>T</i><sub>a</sub>=5°C). During torpor, the relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>a</sub> was curvilinear, and at low <i>T</i><sub>sub</sub> (~6°C), <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> fell to a minimum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e of 8 beats min<sup>−1</sup>. The minimum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es for both [Formula] and <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> in torpor reported here were among the lowest recorded for bats. The relationship between <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> and [Formula] was significant for both resting (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.64, <i>P</i><0.001) and torpid bats (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.84, <i>P</i><0.001), with no overlap between the two states. These variables were also significantly correlated (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=0.44, <i>P</i><0.001) for entire torpor bouts. Moreover, estimates of [Formula] from <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> did not differ significantly from measured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es during the different physiological states. Our study is the first to investigate the accuracy of <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> as a predictor of [Formula] during torpor and indicates the reliability of this method as a potential measure of energy expenditure in the field. Nevertheless, <i>f</i><sub>H</sub> should only be used to predict [Formula] within the range of activities for which robust correlations have been established.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic cost of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es following vocal periods. The total metabolic cost (over resting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic cost of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>In Asia and the Middle-East, people often flex their knees deeply   in order to perform activities of daily living. The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   rotation, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ated the femoral rotation and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau. This method e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ates the femur medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   rotation. When sitting cross-legged, femurs displayed internal rotation   from 10° to 100°. From 100°, femoral external rotation was observed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was observed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The measure kinematic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial pivoting pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°. During   kneeling, a medial pivot pattern was evident. When sitting cross-legged,   a lateral pivot pattern was seen from 0° to 100°, and a medial pivot   pattern beyond 100°.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The kinematics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> knees during high flexion are variable   according to activity. Nevertheless, our study was limited to a   small number of male patients using a different technique to report   the kinematics than previous publications. Accordingly, caution   should be observed in generalizing our findings.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:50–5.</p></sec>

Trends in Hospitalizations and Survival of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure in Four US Communities (2005–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Community trends of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in diverse populations may differ by race and sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) sampled heart failure-related hospitalizations (≥55 years of age) in 4 US communities from 2005 to 2014 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. ADHF hospitalizations were validated by standardized physician review and computer algorithm, yielding 40 173 events after accounting for sampling design (unweighted n=8746).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the ADHF hospitalizations, 50% had reduced ejection fraction, and 39% had preserved EF (HFpEF). HF with reduced ejection fraction was more common in black men and white men, whereas HFpEF was most common in white women. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e age-adjusted rates of ADHF were highest in blacks (38.1 per 1000 black men, 30.5 per 1000 black women), with rates differing by HF type and sex. ADHF rates increased over the 10 years (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e annual percentage change: black women +4.3%, black men +3.7%, white women +1.9%, white men +2.6%), mostly reflecting more acute HFpEF. Age-adjusted 28-day and 1-year case fatality proportions were ≈10% and 30%, respectively, similar across race-sex groups and HF types. Only blacks showed decreased 1-year mortality over time (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e annual percentage change: black women –5.4%, black men –4.6%), with rates differing by HF type (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e annual percentage change: black women HFpEF –7.1%, black men HF with reduced ejection fraction –4.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Between 2005 and 2014, trends in ADHF hospitalizations increased in 4 US communities, primarily driven by acute HFpEF.

High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin and the Risk Stratification of Patients With Renal Impairment Presenting With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may improve the risk stratification and diagnosis of myocardial infarction, but concentrations can be challenging to interpret in patients with renal impairment, and the effectiveness of testing in this group is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter study of consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ated the performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in those with and without renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). The negative predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e and sensitivity of troponin concentrations below the risk stratification threshold (5 ng/L) at presentation were reported for a primary outcome of index type 1 myocardial infarction, or type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. The positive predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e and specificity at the 99th centile diagnostic threshold (16 ng/L in women, 34 ng/L in men) was determined for index type 1 myocardial infarction. Subsequent type 1 myocardial infarction and cardiac death were reported at 1 year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 4726 patients identified, 904 (19%) had renal impairment. Troponin concentrations <5 ng/L at presentation identified 17% of patients with renal impairment as low risk for the primary outcome (negative predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e, 98.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 96.0%–99.7%; sensitivity 98.9%; 95%CI, 97.5%–99.9%), in comparison with 56% without renal impairment (<i>P</i><0.001) with similar performance (negative predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e, 99.7%; 95% CI, 99.4%–99.9%; sensitivity 98.4%; 95% CI, 97.2%–99.4%). The positive predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e and specificity at the 99th centile were lower in patients with renal impairment at 50.0% (95% CI, 45.2%–54.8%) and 70.9% (95% CI, 67.5%–74.2%), respectively, in comparison with 62.4% (95% CI, 58.8%–65.9%) and 92.1% (95% CI, 91.2%–93.0%) in those without. At 1 year, patients with troponin concentrations >99th centile and renal impairment were at greater risk of subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiac death than those with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> renal function (24% versus 10%; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.54–3.11).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In suspected acute coronary syndrome, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin identified fewer patients with renal impairment as low risk and more as high risk, but with lower specificity for type 1 myocardial infarction.

Canagliflozin for Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor that significantly reduces the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and elevated cardiovascular risk. The comparative effects among participants with and without a history of cardiovascular disease (secondary versus primary prevention) were prespecified for e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The CANVAS Program (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) randomly assigned 10 142 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus to canagliflozin or placebo. The primary prevention cohort comprised individuals ≥50 years of age with ≥2 risk factors for cardiovascular events but with no prior cardiovascular event, and the secondary prevention cohort comprised individuals ≥30 years of age with a prior cardiovascular event. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes included heart failure hospitalization and a renal composite (40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, renal replacement therapy, or renal death).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Primary prevention participants (N=3486; 34%) were younger (63 versus 64 years of age), were more often female (45% versus 31%), and had a longer duration of diabetes mellitus (14 versus 13 years) compared with secondary prevention participants (N=6656; 66%). The primary end point event rate was higher in the secondary prevention group compared with the primary prevention group (36.9 versus 15.7/1000 patient-years, <i>P</i><0.001). In the total cohort, the primary end point was reduced with canagliflozin compared with placebo (26.9 versus 31.5/1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75–0.97; <i>P</i><0.001 for noninferiority, <i>P</i>=0.02 for superiority) with no statistical evidence of heterogeneity (interaction <i>P</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e=0.18) between the primary (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.74–1.30) and secondary prevention (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.95) cohorts.

Safety and Tolerability of CSL112, a Reconstituted, Infusible, Plasma-Derived Apolipoprotein A-I, After Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Human or recombinant apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) has been shown to increase high-density lipoprotein–mediated cholesterol efflux capacity and to regress atherosclerotic disease in animal and clinical studies. CSL112 is an infusible, plasma-derived apoA-I that has been studied in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> subjects or those with stable coronary artery disease. This study aimed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CSL112 in patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The AEGIS-I trial (Apo-I Event Reducing in Ischemic Syndromes I) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2b trial. Patients with myocardial infarction were stratified by renal function and randomized 1:1:1 to CSL112 (2 g apoA-I per dose) and high-dose CSL112 (6 g apoA-I per dose), or placebo for 4 consecutive weekly infusions. Coprimary safety end points were occurrence of either a hepatic safety event (an increase in alanine transaminase >3 times the upper limit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> or an increase in total bilirubin >2 times the upper limit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>) or a renal safety event (an increase in serum creatinine >1.5 times the baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e or a new requirement for renal replacement therapy).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1258 patients were randomized, and 91.2% received all 4 infusions. The difference in incidence rates for an increase in alanine transaminase or total bilirubin between both CSL112 arms and placebo was within the protocol-defined noninferiority margin of 4%. Similarly, the difference in incidence rates for an increase in serum creatinine or a new requirement for renal replacement therapy was within the protocol-defined noninferiority margin of 5%. CSL112 was associated with increases in apoA-I and ex vivo cholesterol efflux similar to that achieved in patients with stable coronary artery disease. In regard to the secondary efficacy end point, the risk for the composite of major adverse cardiovascular events among the groups was similar.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with acute myocardial infarction, 4 weekly infusions of CSL112 are feasible, well tolerated, and not associated with any significant alterations in liver or kidney function or other safety concern. The ability of CSL112 to acutely enhance cholesterol efflux was confirmed. The potential benefit of CSL112 to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events needs to be assessed in an adequately powered phase 3 trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Assessment of the European Society of Cardiology 0-Hour/1-Hour Algorithm to Rule-Out and Rule-In Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The new European Society of Cardiology guidelines to rule-in and rule-out acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the emergency department include a rapid assessment algorithm based on high-sensitivity cardiac troponin and sampling at 0 and 1 hour. Emergency department physicians require high sensitivity to confidently rule-out AMI, whereas cardiologists aim to minimize false-positive results.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>High-sensitivity troponin I and T assays were used to measure troponin concentrations in patients presenting with chest-pain symptoms and being investigated for possible acute coronary syndrome at hospitals in New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.

Biased signaling by thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor–specific antibodies determines thyrocyte survival in autoimmunity
<p>The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) is a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptor (GPCR). Autoimmune hyperthyroidism, commonly known as Graves’ disease (GD), is caused by stimulating autoantibodies to the TSHR. We previously described TSHR-specific antibodies (TSHR-Abs) in GD that recognize linear epitopes in the cleavage region of the TSHR ectodomain (C-TSHR-Abs) and induce thyroid cell apoptosis instead of stimulating the TSHR. We found that C-TSHR-Abs entered the cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis but did not trigger endosomal maturation and failed to undergo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> vesicular sorting and trafficking. We found that stimulating TSHR-Abs (S-TSHR-Abs) activated Gα<sub>s</sub> and, to a lesser extent, Gα<sub>q</sub> but that C-TSHR-Abs failed to activate any of the G proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ly activated in response to TSH. Furthermore, specific inhibition of G proteins in the presence of S-TSHR-mAbs or TSH resulted in a similar failure of endosomal maturation as that caused by C-TSHR-mAbs. Hence, whereas S-TSHR-mAbs and TSH contributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> vesicular trafficking of TSHR through the activation of major G proteins, the C-TSHR-Abs resulted in GRK2- and β-arrestin-1–dependent biased signaling, which is interpreted as a danger signal by the cell. Our observations suggest that the binding of antibodies to different TSHR epitopes may decrease cell survival. Antibody-induced cell injury and the response to cell death amplify the loss of self-tolerance, which most likely helps to perpetuate GPCR-mediated autoimmunity.</p>

Mutated clones are the new normal
<p>Cancers are formed by the expansion of harmful “mutational clones,” which are cell populations carrying the same DNA mutations. How harmful they are depends on which mutated genes they contain. On page 970 of this issue, Yizhak <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) add to the evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> tissues are not so <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> after all. Examining a substantial number of healthy tissues from almost 500 individuals, they found a large number of acquired (somatic) DNA mutations—some of which are typically associated with cancer—and mutational clones of macroscopic size, in the absence of cancer pathology. The presence in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> tissues of clonal cell populations, with mutations in cancer-associated genes, is informative about how a tumor evolves from the first mutation to a benign growth and, finally, to cancer.</p>

Somatic mutant clones colonize the human esophagus with age
<p>The extent to which cells in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> tissues accumulate mutations throughout life is poorly understood. Some mutant cells expand into clones that can be detected by genome sequencing. We mapped mutant clones in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> esophageal epithelium from nine donors (age range, 20 to 75 years). Somatic mutations accumulated with age and were caused mainly by intrinsic mutational processes. We found strong positive selection of clones carrying mutations in 14 cancer genes, with tens to hundreds of clones per square centimeter. In middle-aged and elderly donors, clones with cancer-associated mutations covered much of the epithelium, with <i>NOTCH1</i> and <i>TP53</i> mutations affecting 12 to 80% and 2 to 37% of cells, respectively. Unexpectedly, the prevalence of <i>NOTCH1</i> mutations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> esophagus was several times higher than in esophageal cancers. These findings have implications for our understanding of cancer and aging.</p>

Unusual high thermal conductivity in boron arsenide bulk crystals
<p>Conventional theory predicts that ultrahigh lattice thermal conductivity can only occur in crystals composed of strongly bonded light elements, and that it is limited by anharmonic three-phonon processes. We report experimental evidence that departs from these long-held criteria. We measured a local room-temperature thermal conductivity exceeding 1000 watts per meter-kelvin and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e reaching 900 watts per meter-kelvin in bulk boron arsenide (BAs) crystals, where boron and arsenic are light and heavy elements, respectively. The high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es are consistent with a proposal for phonon-band engineering and can only be explained by higher-order phonon processes. These findings yield insight into the physics of heat conduction in solids and show BAs to be the only known semiconductor with ultrahigh thermal conductivity.</p>

Ethics of maternal vaccination
<p>Innovations in vaccine science have given us an incredible opportunity to leverage the maternal immune system to improve maternal, fetal, and infant health outcomes. Maternal vaccination reduces the risk of infant infection primarily through the transfer of protective maternal antibodies to the fetus (<i>1</i>). Although a growing number of countries are adopting maternal vaccine programs against diseases like influenza and pertussis, and there is an increased focus on including pregnant women in trials for new vaccines, there is little discussion of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethic</span></strong>al underpinnings of maternal vaccine programs (<i>2</i>). We see the proposals thus far as being overly paternalistic, founded on a too-limited conception of risk-benefit analyses that has potential to derail the development and use of lifesaving vaccines. By contrast, an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethic</span></strong>al approach focused on mothers' primary interests in protecting themselves and their children could serve as the basis of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ethic</span></strong>al framework that guides vaccine policies.</p>

The Rydberg constant and proton size from atomic hydrogen

Estimating economic damage from climate change in the United States
<p>Estimates of climate change damage are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models.

The combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2% of gross domestic product per +1°C on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20% of county income (90% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).</p>

Cognition-mediated evolution of low-quality floral nectars
<p>Plants pollinated by hummingbirds or bats produce dilute nectars even though these animals prefer more concentrated sugar solutions. This mismatch is an unsolved evolutionary paradox. Here we show that lower quality, or more dilute, nectars evolve when the strength of preferring larger quantities or higher qualities of nectar diminishes as magnitudes of the physical stimuli increase. In a virtual evolution experiment conducted in the tropical rainforest, bats visited computer-automated flowers with simulated genomes that evolved relatively dilute nectars. Simulations replicated this evolution only when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e functions, which relate the physical stimuli to subjective sensations, were nonlinear. Selection also depended on the supply/demand ratio; bats selected for more dilute nectar when competition for food was higher. We predict such a pattern to generally occur when decision-makers consider multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e dimensions simultaneously, and increases of psychological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e are not fully proportional to increases in physical magnitude.</p>

An Essential Role for miRNA167 in Maternal Control of Embryonic and Seed Development
<p>Maternal cells play a critical role in ensuring the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> development of embryos, endosperms, and seeds. Mutations that disrupt the maternal control of embryogenesis and seed development are difficult to identify. Here, we completely deleted four <i>MICRORNA167</i> (<i>MIR167</i>) genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein9 (Cas9) genome-editing technology. We found that plants with a deletion of <i>MIR167A</i> phenocopied plants overexpressing miRNA167-resistant versions of <i>Auxin Response Factor6</i> (<i>ARF6</i>) or <i>ARF8</i>, two miRNA167 targets. Both the <i>mir167a</i> mutant and the <i>ARF</i> overexpression lines were defective in anther dehiscence and ovule development. Serendipitously, we found that the <i>mir167a</i> (♀) × wild type (♂) crosses failed to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> embryos and endosperms, despite the findings that embryos with either <i>mir167a<sup>+/−</sup></i> or <i>mir167a<sup>−/−</sup></i> genotypes developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ly when <i>mir167a<sup>+/−</sup></i> plants were self-pollinated, revealing a central role of <i>MIR167A</i> in maternal control of seed development. The <i>mir167a</i> phenotype is 100% penetrant, providing a great genetic tool for studying the roles of miRNAs and auxin in maternal control. Moreover, we found that <i>mir167a</i> mutants flowered significantly later than wild-type plants, a phenotype that was not observed in the <i>ARF</i> overexpression lines. We show that the reproductive defects of <i>mir167a</i> mutants were suppressed by a decrease of activities of <i>ARF6</i>, <i>ARF8</i>, or both. Our results clearly demonstrate that <i>MIR167A</i> is the predominant <i>MIR167</i> member in regulating Arabidopsis reproduction and that <i>MIR167A</i> acts as a maternal gene that functions largely through <i>ARF6</i> and <i>ARF8</i>.</p>

A Functional Unfolded Protein Response Is Required for Normal Vegetative Development
<p>The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in plants in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and plays an important role in mitigating stress damage. Multiple factors act in the UPR, including the membrane-associated transcription factor, BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER 17 (bZIP17), and the membrane-associated RNA splicing factor, INOSITOL REQUIRING ENZYME1 (IRE1). We have analyzed an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>ire1a ire1b bzip17</i> triple mutant, with defects in stress signaling, and found that the mutant is also impaired in vegetative plant growth under conditions without externally applied stress. This raised the possibility that the UPR functions in plant development in the same manner as it does in responding to stress. bZIP17 is mobilized to the nucleus in response to stress, and through the analysis of a mobilization-defective bZIP17 mutant, we found that to support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> plant development bZIP17 must be capable of mobilization. Likewise, through the analysis of <i>ire1</i> mutants defective in either protein kinase or RNase activities, we found that both must be operative to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> development. These findings demonstrate that the UPR, which is associated with stress responses in plants, also functions under unstressed conditions to support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> development.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion kinetics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion kinetics, diffusion could support <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion kinetics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Cytological and Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Important Roles of <i>CLE19</i> in Pollen Exine Formation
<p>The CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE) peptide signals are required for cell-cell communication in several plant growth and developmental processes. However, little is known regarding the possible functions of the CLEs in the anther. Here, we show that a T-DNA insertional mutant, and dominant-negative (DN) and overexpression (OX) transgenic plants of the <i>CLE19</i> gene, exhibited significantly reduced anther size and pollen grain number and ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> pollen wall formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Interestingly, the <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i> pollen grains showed a more extensively covered surface, but <i>CLE19-OX</i> pollen exine exhibited clearly missing connections in the network and lacked separation between areas that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ly form the lacunae. With a combination of cell biological, genetic, and transcriptomic analyses on <i>cle19</i>, <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i>, and <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants, we demonstrated that <i>CLE19-OX</i> plants produced highly vacuolated and swollen <i>aborted microspores</i> (<i>ams</i>)-like tapetal cells, lacked lipidic tapetosomes and elaioplasts, and had ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> pollen primexine without obvious accumulation of sporopollenin precursors. Moreover, <i>CLE19</i> is important for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> expression of more than 1,000 genes, including the transcription factor gene <i>AMS</i>, 280 <i>AMS</i>-downstream genes, and other genes involved in pollen coat and pollen exine formation, lipid metabolism, pollen germination, and hormone metabolism. In addition, the <i>DN-CLE19(+/+) ams(−/−)</i> plants exhibited the <i>ams</i> anther phenotype and <i>ams(+/−)</i> partially suppressed the <i>DN-CLE19</i> transgene-induced pollen exine defects. These findings demonstrate that the proper amount of CLE19 signal is essential for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> expression of <i>AMS</i> and its downstream gene networks in the regulation of anther development and pollen exine formation.</p>

Construction and Optimization of a Large Gene Coexpression Network in Maize Using RNA-Seq Data
<p>With the emergence of massively parallel sequencing, genomewide expression data production has reached an unprecedented level. This abundance of data has greatly facilitated maize research, but may not be amenable to traditional analysis techniques that were optimized for other data types. Using publicly available data, a gene coexpression network (GCN) can be constructed and used for gene function prediction, candidate gene selection, and improving understanding of regulatory pathways. Several GCN studies have been done in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), mostly using microarray datasets. To build an optimal GCN from plant materials RNA-Seq data, parameters for expression data <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ization and network inference were e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ated.

Three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ization methods and 10 inference methods, including six correlation and four mutual information methods, were tested. The three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ization methods had very similar performance.

Functional Diversification of Kaurene Synthase-Like Genes in <i>Isodon rubescens</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p><i>Ent</i>-kaurene diterpenoids are the largest group of known <i>Isodon</i> diterpenoids. Among them, oridonin is accumulated in the leaves, and is the most frequently studied compound because of its antitumor and antibacterial activities. We have identified five copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) and six kaurene synthase-like (KSL) genes by transcriptome profiling of <i>Isodon rubescens</i> leaves. An in vitro assay assigns ten of them to five different diterpene biosynthesis pathways, except IrCPS3 that has a mutation in the catalytic motif. The Lamiaceae-specific clade genes (IrCPS1 and IrCPS2) synthesize the intermediate copalyl diphosphate (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>-CPP), while IrCPS4 and IrCPS5 synthesize the intermediate <i>ent</i>-copalyl diphosphate (<i>ent</i>-CPP). IrKSL2, IrKSL4, and IrKSL5 react with <i>ent</i>-CPP to produce an <i>ent</i>-isopimaradiene-like compound, <i>ent</i>-atiserene and <i>ent</i>-kaurene, respectively. Correspondingly, the Lamiaceae-specific clade genes IrKSL1 or IrKSL3 combined with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>-CPP led to the formation of miltiradiene. The compound then underwent aromatization and oxidization with a cytochrome P450 forming two related compounds, abietatriene and ferruginol, which were detected in the root bark. IrKSL6 reacts with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>-CPP to produce isopimaradiene. IrKSL3 and IrKSL6 have the γβα tridomain structure, as these proteins tend to possess the bidomain structure of IrKSL1, highlighting the evolutionary history of KSL gene domain loss and further elucidating chemical diversity evolution from a macroevolutionary stance in Lamiaceae.</p>

Differential Codon Adaptation between dsDNA and ssDNA Phages in <i>Escherichia coli</i>
<p>Because phages use their host translation machinery, their codon usage should evolve toward that of highly expressed host genes. We used two indices to measure codon adaptation of phages to their host, <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> (the correlation in relative synonymous codon usage [RSCU] between phages and their host) and Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) computed with highly expressed host genes as the reference set (because phage translation depends on host translation machinery). These indices used for this purpose are appropriate only when hosts exhibit little mutation bias, so only phages parasitizing <i>Escherichia coli</i> were included in the analysis. For double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phages, both <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> and CAI decrease with increasing number of transfer RNA genes encoded by the phage genome. <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> is greater for dsDNA phages than for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) phages, and the low <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es are mainly due to poor concordance in RSCU <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es for Y-ending codons between ssDNA phages and the <i>E. coli</i> host, consistent with the predicted effect of C→T mutation bias in the ssDNA phages. Strong C→T mutation bias would improve codon adaptation in codon families (e.g., Gly) where U-ending codons are favored over C-ending codons (“U-friendly” codon families) by highly expressed host genes but decrease codon adaptation in other codon families where highly expressed host genes favor C-ending codons against U-ending codons (“U-hostile” codon families). It is remarkable that ssDNA phages with increasing C→T mutation bias also increased the usage of codons in the “U-friendly” codon families, thereby achieving CAI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es almost as large as those of dsDNA phages. This represents a new type of codon adaptation.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-link>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-link>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Transmembrane voltage potential is an essential cellular parameter for the detection and control of tumor development in a <i>Xenopus</i> model
<p>Understanding mechanisms that orchestrate cell behavior into appropriately patterned tissues and organs within the organism is an essential element of preventing, detecting and treating cancer. Bioelectric signals (resting transmembrane voltage potential gradients in all cells) underlie an important and broadly conserved set of control mechanisms that regulate pattern formation. We tested the role of transmembrane potential in tumorigenesis mediated by canonical oncogenes in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>. Depolarized membrane potential (<i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>) was a characteristic of induced tumor-like structures (ITLSs) generated by overexpression of <i>Gli1</i>, <i>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></i>, <i>Xrel3</i> or <i>p53<sup>Trp248</sup></i>. This bioelectric signature was also present in precursor ITLS sites. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a bioelectric marker that reveals ITLSs before they become histologically and morphologically apparent. Moreover, voltage was functionally important: overexpression of hyperpolarizing ion transporters caused a return to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> and significantly reduced ITLS formation <i>in vivo</i>. To characterize the molecular mechanism by which <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> change regulates ITLS phenotypes, we performed a suppression screen. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> hyperpolarization was transduced into downstream events via <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>-regulated activity of SLC5A8, a sodium-butyrate exchanger previously implicated in human cancer. These data indicate that butyrate, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, might be responsible for transcriptional events that mediate suppression of ITLSs by hyperpolarization. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a convenient cellular parameter by which tumors induced by human oncogenes can be detected <i>in vivo</i> and represents a new diagnostic modality. Moreover, control of resting membrane potential is functionally involved in the process by which oncogene-bearing cells depart from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> morphogenesis programs to form tumors. Modulation of <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> levels is a novel and promising strategy for tumor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ization.</p>

WT1 regulates the development of the posterior taste field
<p>Despite the importance of taste in determining nutrient intake, our understanding of the processes that control the development of the peripheral taste system is lacking. Several early regulators of taste development have been identified, including sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 4 and multiple members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulation of these factors, including their induction, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial role for the Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) in circumvallate (CV) papillae development. WT1 is a transcription factor that is important in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> development of multiple tissues, including both the olfactory and visual systems. In mice, WT1 expression is detectable by E12.5, when the CV taste placode begins to form. In mice lacking WT1, the CV fails to develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>ly and markers of early taste development are dysregulated compared with wild type. We demonstrate that expression of the WT1 target genes <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Bmp4</i> is significantly reduced in developing tongue tissue derived from <i>Wt1</i> knockout mice and that, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> tongue, WT1 is bound to the promoter regions of these genes. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of WT1 in cultured taste cells leads to a reduction in the expression of <i>Lef1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. Our data identify WT1 as a crucial transcription factor in the development of the CV through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways that have established roles in the formation and patterning of taste placodes.</p>

Value of Progression of Coronary Artery Calcification for Risk Prediction of Coronary and Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Computed tomography (CT) allows estimation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. We e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ated several progression algorithms in our unselected, population-based cohort for risk prediction of coronary and cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In 3281 participants (45–74 years of age), free from cardiovascular disease until the second visit, risk factors, and CTs at baseline (b) and after a mean of 5.1 years (5y) were measured. Hard coronary and cardiovascular events, and total cardiovascular events including revascularization, as well, were recorded during a follow-up time of 7.8±2.2 years after the second CT. The added predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e of 10 CAC progression algorithms on top of risk factors including baseline CAC was e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ated by using survival analysis, C-statistics, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination index. A subgroup analysis of risk in CAC categories was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We observed 85 (2.6%) hard coronary, 161 (4.9%) hard cardiovascular, and 241 (7.3%) total cardiovascular events. Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for hard/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e of baseline CT and risk assessment in terms of C-statistic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not improve models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year risk factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and hard/total cardiovascular risk: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively. When CAC<sub>b</sub> progressed from 1 to 399 to CAC<sub>5y</sub>≥400, coronary and total cardiovascular risk were nearly 2-fold in comparison with subjects who remained below CAC<sub>5y</sub>=400. Participants with CAC<sub>b</sub>≥400 had high rates of hard coronary and hard/total cardiovascular events (10-year risk: 12.0%, 13.5%, and 30.9%, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CAC progression is associated with coronary and cardiovascular event rates, but adds only weakly to risk prediction. What counts is the most recent CAC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e and risk factor assessment. Therefore, a repeat scan >5 years after the first scan may be of additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e, except when a double-zero CT scan is present or when the subjects are already at high risk.</p></sec>

Prevalence of Subclinical Coronary Artery Disease in Masters Endurance Athletes With a Low Atherosclerotic Risk Profile
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies in middle-age and older (masters) athletes with atherosclerotic risk factors for coronary artery disease report higher coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores compared with sedentary individuals. Few studies have assessed the prevalence of coronary artery disease in masters athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed 152 masters athletes 54.4±8.5 years of age (70% male) and 92 controls of similar age, sex, and low Framingham 10-year coronary artery disease risk scores with an echocardiogram, exercise stress test, computerized tomographic coronary angiogram, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging with late gadolinium enhancement and a 24-hour Holter. Athletes had participated in endurance exercise for an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e of 31±12.6 years. The majority (77%) were runners, with a median of 13 marathon runs per athlete.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Most athletes (60%) and controls (63%) had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> CAC score. Male athletes had a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques of any luminal irregularity (44.3% versus 22.2%; <i>P</i>=0.009) compared with sedentary males, and only male athletes showed a CAC ≥300 Agatston units (11.3%) and a luminal stenosis ≥50% (7.5%). Male athletes demonstrated predominantly calcific plaques (72.7%), whereas sedentary males showed predominantly mixed morphology plaques (61.5%). The number of years of training was the only independent variable associated with increased risk of CAC >70th percentile for age or luminal stenosis ≥50% in male athletes (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.15; <i>P</i>=0.016); 15 (14%) male athletes but none of the controls revealed late gadolinium enhancement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Of these athletes, 7 had a pattern consistent with previous myocardial infarction, including 3(42%) with a luminal stenosis ≥50% in the corresponding artery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Most lifelong masters endurance athletes with a low atherosclerotic risk profile have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> CAC scores. Male athletes are more likely to have a CAC score >300 Agatston units or coronary plaques compared with sedentary males with a similar risk profile. The significance of these observations is uncertain, but the predominantly calcific morphology of the plaques in athletes indicates potentially different pathophysiological mechanisms for plaque formation in athletic versus sedentary men. Coronary plaques are more abundant in athletes, whereas their stable nature could mitigate the risk of plaque rupture and acute myocardial infarction.</p></sec>

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging metabolic theory of pulmonary hypertension (PH) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (PH-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, accompanied by an increased ratio of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these metabolic alterations in PH-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in PH-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio, which promotes glycolysis and proliferation even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe PH (PH-Fibs) and from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; restoration of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. Metabolic products were determined by mass spectrometry–based metabolomics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> subjects. PKM2 inhibition reversed the glycolytic status of PH-Fibs, decreased their cell proliferation, and attenuated macrophage interleukin-1β expression. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>izing the PKM2/PKM1 ratio in PH-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown reversed the glycolytic phenotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell proliferation. Pharmacological manipulation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In PH, miR-124, through the alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 ratio, the overall metabolic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells. This PH phenotype can be rescued with interventions at various levels of the metabolic cascade. These findings suggest a more integrated view of vascular cell metabolism, which may open unique therapeutic prospects in targeting the dynamic glycolytic and mitochondrial interactions and between mesenchymal inflammatory cells in PH.</p></sec>

Role of Diastolic Stress Testing in the Evaluation for Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is challenging and relies largely on demonstration of elevated cardiac filling pressures (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure). Current guidelines recommend use of natriuretic peptides (N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide) and rest/exercise echocardiography (E/e′ ratio) to make this determination. Data to support this practice are conflicting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Simultaneous echocardiographic-catheterization studies were prospectively conducted at rest and during exercise in subjects with invasively proven HFpEF (n=50) and participants with dyspnea but no identifiable cardiac pathology (n=24).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>N-Terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels were below the level considered to exclude disease (≤125 pg/mL) in 18% of subjects with HFpEF.

Although specific, current guidelines were poorly sensitive, identifying only 34% to 60% of subjects with invasively proven HFpEF on the basis of resting echocardiographic data alone.

Site-based diagnostic test reports were classified as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> or mildly, moderately, or severely ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>. The primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalizations over a median follow-up of 26.1 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both the prevalence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> test results and incidence rate of events in these patients were significantly lower among 4500 patients randomly assigned to CTA in comparison with 4602 patients randomly assigned to functional testing (33.4% versus 78.0%, and 0.9% versus 2.1%, respectively; both <i>P</i><0.001). In CTA, 54.0% of events (n=74/137) occurred in patients with nonobstructive CAD (1%–69% stenosis). Prevalence of obstructive CAD and myocardial ischemia was low (11.9% versus 12.7%, respectively), with both findings having similar prognostic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e (hazard ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.60–5.39; and 3.47; 95% CI, 2.42–4.99). When test findings were stratified as mildly, moderately, or severely ab<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong>, hazard ratios for events in comparison with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> tests increased proportionally for CTA (2.94, 7.67, 10.13; all <i>P</i><0.001) but not for corresponding functional testing categories (0.94 [<i>P</i>=0.87], 2.65 [<i>P</i>=0.001], 3.88 [<i>P</i><0.001]).

Cardiac Outcomes After Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack

Impact of Practice-Based Management of Pulmonary Artery Pressures in 2000 Patients Implanted With the CardioMEMS Sensor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures in patients with heart failure are associated with a high risk for hospitalization and mortality. Recent clinical trial evidence demonstrated a direct relationship between lowering remotely monitored PA pressures and heart failure hospitalization risk reduction with a novel implantable PA pressure monitoring system (CardioMEMS HF System, St. Jude Medical). This study examines PA pressure changes in the first 2000 US patients implanted in general practice use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Deidentified data from the remote monitoring Merlin.net (St. Jude Medical) database were used to examine PA pressure trends from the first consecutive 2000 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up. Changes in PA pressures were e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>ated with an area under the curve methodology to estimate the total sum increase or decrease in pressures (mm Hg-day) during the follow-up period relative to the baseline pressure. As a reference, the PA pressure trends were compared with the historic CHAMPION clinical trial (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class III Heart Failure Patients). The area under the curve results are presented as mean±2 SE, and <i>P</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es comparing the area under the curve of the general-use cohort with outcomes in the CHAMPION trial were computed by the <i>t</i> test with equal variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients were on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e 70±12 years old; 60% were male; 34% had preserved ejection fraction; and patients were followed up for an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e of 333±125 days.

The general-use patients had an area under the curve of −32.8 mm Hg-day at the 1-month time mark, −156.2 mm Hg-day at the 3-month time mark, and −434.0 mm Hg-day after 6 months of hemodynamic guided care, which was significantly lower than the treatment group in the CHAMPION trial.

Clinic Blood Pressure Underestimates Ambulatory Blood Pressure in an Untreated Employer-Based US Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) is consistently superior to clinic blood pressure (CBP) as a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk. A common perception is that ABP is usually lower than CBP. The relationship of the CBP minus ABP difference to age has not been examined in the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between 2005 and 2012, 888 healthy, employed, middle-aged (mean±SD age, 45±10.4 years) individuals (59% female, 7.4% black, 12% Hispanic) with screening BP <160/105 mm Hg and not taking antihypertensive medication completed 3 separate clinic BP assessments and a 24-hour ABP recording for the Masked Hypertension Study. The distributions of CBP, mean awake ABP (aABP), and the CBP−aABP difference in the full sample and by demographic characteristics were compared. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing was used to model the relationship of the BP measures to age and body mass index. The prevalence of discrepancies in ABP- versus CBP-defined hypertension status—white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension—were also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e systolic/diastolic aABP (123.0/77.4±10.3/7.4 mm Hg) was significantly higher than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">averag</span></strong>e of 9 CBP readings over 3 visits (116.0/75.4±11.6/7.7 mm Hg). aABP exceeded CBP by >10 mm Hg much more frequently than CBP exceeded aABP. The difference (aABP>CBP) was most pronounced in young adults and those with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">normal</span></strong> body mass index. The systolic difference progressively diminished, but did not disappear, at older ages and higher body mass indexes. The diastolic difference vanished around age 65 and reversed (CBP>aABP) for body mass index >32.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Whereas 5.3% of participants were hypertensive by CBP, 19.2% were hypertensive by aABP; 15.7% of those with nonelevated CBP had masked hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Contrary to a widely held belief, based primarily on cohort studies of patients with elevated CBP, ABP is not usually lower than CBP, at least not among healthy, employed individuals. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of otherwise healthy individuals with nonelevated CBP have masked hypertension. Demonstrated CBP−aABP gradients, if confirmed in representative samples (eg, NHANES [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]), could provide guidance for primary care physicians as to when, for a given CBP, 24-hour ABP would be useful to identify or rule out masked hypertension.</p></sec>

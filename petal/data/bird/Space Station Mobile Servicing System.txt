A cargo-sorting DNA robot
<p>Two critical challenges in the design and synthesis of molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>s are modularity and algorithm simplicity. We demonstrate three modular building blocks for a DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> that performs cargo sorting at the molecular level. A simple algorithm encoding recognition between cargos and their destinations allows for a simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> design: a single-stranded DNA with one leg and two foot domains for walking, and one arm and one hand domain for picking up and dropping off cargos. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> explores a two-dimensional testing ground on the surface of DNA origami, picks up multiple cargos of two types that are initially at unordered locations, and delivers them to specified destinations until all molecules are sorted into two distinct piles. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> is designed to perform a random walk without any energy supply. Exploiting this feature, a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> can repeatedly sort multiple cargos. Localization on DNA origami allows for distinct cargo-sorting tasks to take place simultaneously in one test tube or for multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>s to collectively perform the same task.</p>

A tailless aerial robotic flapper reveals that flies use torque coupling in rapid banked turns
<p>Insects are among the most agile natural flyers. Hypotheses on their flight control cannot always be validated by experiments with animals or tethered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>s. To this end, we developed a programmable and agile autonomous free-flying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> controlled through bio-inspired motion changes of its flapping wings. Despite being 55 times the size of a fruit fly, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> can accurately mimic the rapid escape maneuvers of flies, including a correcting yaw rotation toward the escape heading. Because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>’s yaw control was turned off, we showed that these yaw rotations result from passive, translation-induced aerodynamic coupling between the yaw torque and the roll and pitch torques produced throughout the maneuver. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> enables new methods for studying animal flight, and its flight characteristics allow for real-world flight missions.</p>

Hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic actuators with muscle-like performance
<p>Existing soft actuators have persistent challenges that restrain the potential of soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>ics, highlighting a need for soft transducers that are powerful, high-speed, efficient, and robust. We describe a class of soft actuators, termed hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, which harness a mechanism that couples electrostatic and hydraulic forces to achieve a variety of actuation modes. We introduce prototypical designs of HASEL actuators and demonstrate their robust, muscle-like performance as well as their ability to repeatedly self-heal after dielectric breakdown—all using widely available materials and common fabrication techniques. A soft gripper handling delicate objects and a self-sensing artificial muscle powering a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>ic arm illustrate the wide potential of HASEL actuators for next-generation soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>ic devices.</p>

The spread of true and false news online
<p>We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>s accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>s, are more likely to spread it.</p>

A self-assembled nanoscale robotic arm controlled by electric fields
<p>The use of dynamic, self-assembled DNA nanostructures in the context of nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>ics requires fast and reliable actuation mechanisms. We therefore created a 55-nanometer–by–55-nanometer DNA-based molecular platform with an integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>ic arm of length 25 nanometers, which can be extended to more than 400 nanometers and actuated with externally applied electrical fields. Precise, computer-controlled switching of the arm between arbitrary positions on the platform can be achieved within milliseconds, as demonstrated with single-pair Forster resonance energy transfer experiments and fluorescence microscopy. The arm can be used for electrically driven transport of molecules or nanoparticles over tens of nanometers, which is useful for the control of photonic and plasmonic processes. Application of piconewton forces by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> arm</span></strong> is demonstrated in force-induced DNA duplex melting experiments.</p>

Mechanoresponsive self-growing hydrogels inspired by muscle training
<p>Living tissues, such as muscle, autonomously grow and remodel themselves to adapt to their surrounding mechanical environment through metabolic processes. By contrast, typical synthetic materials cannot grow and reconstruct their structures once formed. We propose a strategy for developing “self-growing” polymeric materials that respond to repetitive mechanical stress through an effective mechanochemical transduction. Robust double-network hydrogels provided with a sustained monomer supply undergo self-growth, and the materials are substantially strengthened under repetitive loading through a structural destruction-reconstruction process. This strategy also endows the hydrogels with tailored functions at desired positions by mechanical stamping. This work may pave the way for the development of self-growing gel materials for applications such as soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>s and intelligent devices.</p>

Organic synthesis in a modular robotic system driven by a chemical programming language
<p>The synthesis of complex organic compounds is largely a manual process that is often incompletely documented. To address these shortcomings, we developed an abstraction that maps commonly reported methodological instructions into discrete steps amenable to automation. These unit operations were implemented in a modular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>ic platform by using a chemical programming language that formalizes and controls the assembly of the molecules. We validated the concept by directing the automated system to synthesize three pharmaceutical compounds, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, rufinamide, and sildenafil, without any human intervention. Yields and purities of products and intermediates were comparable to or better than those achieved manually. The syntheses are captured as digital code that can be published, versioned, and transferred flexibly between platforms with no modification, thereby greatly enhancing reproducibility and reliable access to complex molecules.</p>

Neonicotinoid exposure disrupts bumblebee nest behavior, social networks, and thermoregulation
<p>Neonicotinoid pesticides can negatively affect bee colonies, but the behavioral mechanisms by which these compounds impair colony growth remain unclear. Here, we investigate imidacloprid’s effects on bumblebee worker behavior within the nest, using an automated, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>ic platform for continuous, multicolony monitoring of uniquely identified workers. We find that exposure to field-realistic levels of imidacloprid impairs nursing and alters social and spatial dynamics within nests, but that these effects vary substantially with time of day. In the field, imidacloprid impairs colony thermoregulation, including the construction of an insulating wax canopy. Our results show that neonicotinoids induce widespread disruption of within-nest worker behavior that may contribute to impaired growth, highlighting the potential of automated techniques for characterizing the multifaceted, dynamic impacts of stressors on behavior in bee colonies.</p>

Metal-free three-dimensional perovskite ferroelectrics
<p>Inorganic perovskite ferroelectrics are widely used in nonvolatile memory elements, capacitors, and sensors because of their excellent ferroelectric and other properties. Organic ferroelectrics are desirable for their mechanical flexibility, low weight, environmentally friendly processing, and low processing temperatures. Although almost a century has passed since the first ferroelectric, Rochelle salt, was discovered, examples of highly desirable organic perovskite ferroelectrics are lacking. We found a family of metal-free organic perovskite ferroelectrics with the characteristic three-dimensional structure, among which MDABCO (<i>N</i>-methyl-<i>N'</i>-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium)–ammonium triiodide has a spontaneous polarization of 22 microcoulombs per square centimeter [close to that of barium titanate (BTO)], a high phase transition temperature of 448 kelvins (above that of BTO), and eight possible polarization directions. These attributes make it attractive for use in flexible devices, soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>ics, biomedical devices, and other applications.</p>

Handedness in shearing auxetics creates rigid and compliant structures
<p>In nature, repeated base units produce handed structures that selectively bond to make rigid or compliant materials. Auxetic tilings are scale-independent frameworks made from repeated unit cells that expand under tension. We discovered how to produce handedness in auxetic unit cells that shear as they expand by changing the symmetries and alignments of auxetic tilings. Using the symmetry and alignment rules that we developed, we made handed shearing auxetics that tile planes, cylinders, and spheres. By compositing the handed shearing auxetics in a manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant structures that expand while twisting and deployable structures that can rigidly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical frameworks, medical devices like stents, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>ic systems, and deployable engineering structures.</p>

Soliton microcomb range measurement
<p>Laser-based range measurement systems are important in many application areas, including autonomous vehicles, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>ics, manufacturing, formation flying of satellites, and basic science. Coherent laser ranging systems using dual-frequency combs provide an unprecedented combination of long range, high precision, and fast update rate. We report dual-comb distance measurement using chip-based soliton microcombs. A single pump laser was used to generate dual-frequency combs within a single microresonator as counterpropagating solitons. We demonstrated time-of-flight measurement with 200-nanometer precision at an averaging time of 500 milliseconds within a range ambiguity of 16 millimeters. Measurements at distances up to 25 meters with much lower precision were also performed. Our chip-based source is an important step toward miniature dual-comb laser ranging systems that are suitable for photonic integration.</p>

DNA sequence–directed shape change of photopatterned hydrogels via high-degree swelling
<p>Shape-changing hydrogels that can bend, twist, or actuate in response to external stimuli are critical to soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>s, programmable matter, and smart medicine. Shape change in hydrogels has been induced by global cues, including temperature, light, or pH. Here we demonstrate that specific DNA molecules can induce 100-fold volumetric hydrogel expansion by successive extension of cross-links. We photopattern up to centimeter-sized gels containing multiple domains that undergo different shape changes in response to different DNA sequences. Experiments and simulations suggest a simple design rule for controlled shape change. Because DNA molecules can be coupled to molecular sensors, amplifiers, and logic circuits, this strategy introduces the possibility of building soft devices that respond to diverse biochemical inputs and autonomously implement chemical control programs.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of plants are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis modeling. However, the construction of accurate 3D plant models is challenging, as plants are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-based method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all plants, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target plant, tuning camera placement to match the plant’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic plant modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based plant reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different plant structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of plant types.</p>

<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of seed traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher plants. In particular, seed mass is generally regarded to be key for seedling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed seed size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single seeds, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i>Seeder, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual seeds of very different sizes. The system consists of a pick-and-place <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong> and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual seeds are two-dimensional data from projections, three-dimensional data from volumetric measures, and mass, from which seed density is also calculated. Each seed is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be planted, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine seed-to-plant tracking pipelines). By investigating seeds of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rapeseed (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped seeds of rapeseed, correlations between the projected area and the mass of seeds were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for seed mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated seed phenotyping on a single-seed basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including seed classification, seed sorting, and assessment of seed quality.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">robot</span></strong>ic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

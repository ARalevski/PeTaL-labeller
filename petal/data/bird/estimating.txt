The Cost-Effectiveness of Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Patients at Risk of Infective Endocarditis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In March 2008, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended stopping antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) for those at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of infective endocarditis (IE) undergoing dental procedures in the United Kingdom, citing a lack of evidence of efficacy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness. We have performed a new economic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ation of AP on the basis of contemporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of efficacy, adverse events, and resource implications.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A decision analytic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness model was used.

Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>AP was less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>ly and more effective than no AP for all patients at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of IE. The results are sensitive to AP efficacy, but efficacy would have to be substantially lower for AP not to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective. AP was even more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective in patients at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> and 33 cases in all at-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> patients) would be required for AP to be considered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective at £20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> savings of £5.5 to £8.2 million ($7.3–$10.9 million) and health gains >2600 quality-adjusted life-years could be achieved from reinstating AP in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>AP is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effective for preventing IE, particularly in those at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.

Lack of Concordance Between Empirical Scores and Physician Assessments of Stroke and Bleeding Risk in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must weigh the benefits of anticoagulation in preventing stroke versus the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of bleeding. Although empirical models have been developed to predict such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s, the degree to which these coincide with clinicians’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined 10 094 AF patients enrolled in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of AF (ORBIT-AF) registry between June 2010 and August 2011. Empirical stroke and bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s were assessed by using the congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS<sub>2</sub>) and Anticoagulation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) scores, respectively. Separately, physicians were asked to categorize their patients’ stroke and bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s: low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (<3%); intermediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (3%–6%); and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (>6%). Overall, 72% (n=7251) in ORBIT-AF had high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores (≥2). However, only 16% were assessed as high stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> by physicians. Although 17% (n=1749) had high ATRIA bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (score ≥5), only 7% (n=719) were considered so by physicians. The associations between empirical and physician-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ated stroke and bleeding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s were low (weighted Kappa 0.1 and 0.11, respectively).

Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation. The novel method of LDL-C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>).

Absolute CAC progression was higher with versus without subsequent coronary events (median, 115 [Q1–Q3, 23–360] versus 8 [0–83], <i>P</i><0.0001; similar for hard/total cardiovascular events). Some progression algorithms added to the predictive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e of baseline CT and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> assessment in terms of C-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ic or integrated discrimination index, especially for total cardiovascular events. However, CAC progression did not improve models including CAC<sub>5y</sub> and 5-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. An excellent prognosis was found for 921 participants with double-zero CAC<sub>b</sub>=CAC<sub>5y</sub>=0 (10-year coronary and hard/total cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>: 1.4%, 2.0%, and 2.8%), which was for participants with incident CAC 1.8%, 3.8%, and 6.6%, respectively. When CAC<sub>b</sub> progressed from 1 to 399 to CAC<sub>5y</sub>≥400, coronary and total cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> were nearly 2-fold in comparison with subjects who remained below CAC<sub>5y</sub>=400.

After adjustment for demographics, PAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, and other covariates, HIV+ veterans had an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of incident PAD events compared with uninfected veterans (hazard ratio [HR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.25). This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was highest among those with time-updated HIV viral load >500 copies/mL (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.38–1.65) and CD4 cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">count</span></strong>s <200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.71–2.13).

Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Functions Underestimate Risk in HIV Infection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> is elevated in HIV-infected individuals, with contributions from both traditional and nontraditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. The accuracy of established CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction functions in HIV is uncertain. We sought to assess the performance of 3 established CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction functions in a longitudinal cohort of HIV-infected men.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The FHS (Framingham Heart Study) functions for hard coronary heart disease (FHS CHD) and atherosclerotic CVD (FHS ASCVD) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD function were applied to the Partners HIV cohort. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores were calculated between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008. Outcomes included CHD (myocardial infarction or coronary death) for the FHS CHD function and ASCVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary death) for the FHS ASCVD and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD functions. We investigated the accuracy of CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> prediction for each function when applied to the HIV cohort using comparison of Cox regression coefficients, discrimination, and calibration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The HIV cohort was comprised of 1272 men followed for a median of 4.4 years. There were 78 (6.1%) ASCVD events; the 5-year incidence rate was 16.4 per 1000 person-years. Discrimination was moderate to poor as indicated by the low <i>c</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ic (0.68 for FHS CHD, 0.65 for American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ASCVD, and 0.67 for FHS ASCVD).

Impact of Lipid Measurements in Youth in Addition to Conventional Clinic-Based Risk Factors on Predicting Preclinical Atherosclerosis in Adulthood
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Data suggest that the prediction of adult cardiovascular disease using a model comprised entirely of adult nonlaboratory-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors is equivalent to an approach that additionally incorporates adult lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es.

Female Sex Is a Risk Modifier Rather Than a Risk Factor for Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in atrial fibrillation is assessed by using the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score. Sex category (Sc, ie, female sex) confers 1 point on CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc. We hypothesized that female sex is a stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> modifier, rather than an overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor, when added to a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA (sex-independent thromboembolism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>) score scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using 3 nationwide registries, we identified patients with incident nonvalvular atrial fibrillation from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 2015. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant treatment at baseline were excluded, and person-time was censored at the time of treatment initiation (if any). CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were calculated for men and women, and were followed for up to 1 year in the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was a primary hospital code for ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (thromboembolism). We calculated crude event rates for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> strata as events per 100 person-years. For quantifying absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of stroke, we calculated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s based on the pseudo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e method. Female sex as a prognostic factor was investigated by inclusion as an interaction term on the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score to calculate the thromboembolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> ratio for different score points.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 239 671 patients with atrial fibrillation (48.7% women) contributed to the analyses. The mean ages for women and men were 76.6 years and 70.3 years, respectively; the mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA scores were 2.7 for women and 2.3 for men. The overall 1-year thromboembolic rate per 100 person-years for women was 7.3 and 5.7 for men. The 1-year absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of thromboembolism was 0.5% among men and women with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score of 0 and increased up to >7% among very comorbid patients (score >5). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> ratio (male as reference) across points >1 indicated that women exhibit a higher stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.

Initial decisions on oral anticoagulant treatment could be guided by a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VA score (ie, excluding the sex category criterion), but the Sc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> component modifies and accentuates stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in women who would have been eligible for oral anticoagulant treatment on the basis of ≥2 additional stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors.</p></sec>

In persons with SBP <160 mm Hg, CAC stratified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for events. For example, among those with an ASCVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of <15% and who had an SBP of either 120 to 139 mm Hg or 140 to 159 mm Hg, respectively, we found increasing hazard ratios for events with CAC 1 to 100 (1.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.0–2.6] or 2.0 [1.1–3.8]) and CAC >100 (3.0 [1.8–5.0] or 5.7 [2.9–11.0]), all relative to CAC=0.

Identification of individuals at greatest AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> could minimize the incidence of cardioembolic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>To determine whether genetic data can stratify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for development of AF, we examined associations between AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores and incident AF in 5 prospective studies comprising 18 919 individuals of European ancestry. We examined associations between AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores and ischemic stroke in a separate study of 509 ischemic stroke cases (202 cardioembolic [40%]) and 3028 referents. Scores were based on 11 to 719 common variants (≥5%) associated with AF at <i>P</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es ranging from <1×10<sup>−3</sup> to <1×10<sup>−8</sup> in a prior independent genetic association study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Incident AF occurred in 1032 individuals (5.5%). AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores were associated with new-onset AF after adjustment for clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. The pooled hazard ratio for incident AF for the highest versus lowest quartile of genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores ranged from 1.28 (719 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–1.46; <i>P</i>=1.5×10<sup>−4</sup>) to 1.67 (25 variants; 95% confidence interval, 1.47–1.90; <i>P</i>=9.3×10<sup>−15</sup>). Discrimination of combined clinical and genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores varied across studies and scores (maximum C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ic, 0.629–0.811; maximum ΔC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ic from clinical score alone, 0.009–0.017). AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was associated with stroke in age- and sex-adjusted models. For example, individuals in the highest versus lowest quartile of a 127-variant score had a 2.49-fold increased odds of cardioembolic stroke (95% confidence interval, 1.39–4.58; <i>P</i>=2.7×10<sup>−3</sup>). The effect persisted after the exclusion of individuals (n=70) with known AF (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.20–4.40; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Comprehensive AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> scores were associated with incident AF beyond associations for clinical AF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors but offered small improvements in discrimination. AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was also associated with cardioembolic stroke in age- and sex-adjusted analyses. Efforts are warranted to determine whether AF genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> may improve identification of subclinical AF or help distinguish between stroke mechanisms.</p></sec>

Risk of Cerebrovascular Events in 178 962 Five-Year Survivors of Cancer Diagnosed at 15 to 39 Years of Age
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survivors of teenage and young adult cancer are at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of cerebrovascular events, but the magnitude of and extent to which this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> varies by cancer type, decade of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and attained age remains uncertain.

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)
<p>Bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>) produce various communicative sounds that are important for social behavior, maintaining group cohesion and coordinating foraging. For example, whistle production increases during disturbances, such as separations of mother–calf pairs and vessel approaches. It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es following vocal periods. The total metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> (over resting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Oral Anticoagulation in Very Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants (OACs) is the cornerstone for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data about the use of OACs among patients ≥90 years of age are limited. We aimed to investigate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the net clinical benefit of OAC treatment for very elderly patients with AF (≥90 years of age).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of ischemic stroke and ICH were compared between 11 064 and 14 658 patients with and without AF ≥90 years of age without antithrombotic therapy from 1996 to 2011. Patients with AF (n=15 756) were divided into 3 groups (no treatment, antiplatelet agents, and warfarin), and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of stroke and ICH were analyzed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of ischemic stroke and ICH were further compared between patients treated with warfarin and nonvitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) from 2012 to 2015 when NOACs were available in Taiwan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with patients without AF, patients with AF had an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic stroke (event number/patient number, incidence = 742/11 064, 5.75%/y versus 1399/14 658, 3.00%/y; hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.74–2.14) and similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ICH (131/11 064, 0.97%/y versus 206/14 658, 0.54%/y; hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.09) in competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> analysis for mortality. Among patients with AF, warfarin use was associated with a lower stroke <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (39/617, 3.83%/y versus 742/11 064, 5.75%/y; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.96 in a competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> model), with no difference in ICH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> compared with nontreatment. When compared with no antithrombotic therapy or antiplatelet drugs, warfarin was associated with a positive net clinical benefit. These findings persisted in propensity-matched analyses. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were associated with a lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ICH (4/978, 0.42%/y versus 19/768, 1.63%/y; hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.10–0.97 in a competing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> model), with no difference in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with AF ≥90 years of age, warfarin was associated with a lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic stroke and positive net clinical benefit. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were associated with a lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ICH. Thus, OACs may still be considered as thromboprophylaxis for elderly patients, with NOACs being the more favorable choice.</p></sec>

Sex Differences and Similarities in Atrial Fibrillation Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Mortality in Community Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac disease in aging populations with high comorbidity and mortality. Sex differences in AF epidemiology are insufficiently understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In N=79 793 individuals without AF diagnosis at baseline (median age, 49.6 years; age range, 24.1–97.6 years; 51.7% women) from 4 community-based European studies (FIN<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, DanMONICA, Moli-sani Northern Sweden) of the BiomarCaRE consortium (Biomarker for Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Assessment in Europe), we examined AF incidence, its association with mortality, common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors, biomarkers, and prevalent cardiovascular disease, and their attributable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> by sex. Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were observed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular disease was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was similar (>30%) for both sexes. Subjects with incident AF had a 3.5-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of death in comparison with those without AF. Multivariable-adjusted models showed sex differences for the association of body mass index and AF (hazard ratio per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">standard devi</span></strong>ation increase, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.23 in women versus 1.31; 95% CI 1.25–1.38 in men; interaction <i>P</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e of 0.001).

Improving the accuracy of synovial fluid analysis in the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection with simple and inexpensive biomarkers
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to increase the diagnostic accuracy   of the analysis of synovial fluid in the differentiation of prosthetic   joint infection (PJI) by the addition of inexpensive biomarkers   such as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), adenosine deaminase   (ADA), alpha-2-macrogloblulin (α2M) and procalcitonin.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between January 2013 and December 2015, synovial fluid and removed   implants were requested from 143 revision total joint arthroplasties.

The   levels of total leucocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">count</span></strong>, proportion of polymorphonuclear   leucocytes (PMNs), CRP, ADA and α2M in the synovial fluid were all   significantly higher in those with a PJI than in those with aseptic   loosening.

Venous thromboembolic prophylaxis after simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to compare the efficacy of two agents,   aspirin and warfarin, for the prevention of venous thromboembolism   (VTE) after simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty (SBTKA),   and to elucidate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of VTE conferred by this procedure compared   with unilateral TKA (UTKA).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective, multi-institutional study was conducted on 18   951 patients, 3685 who underwent SBTKA and 15 266 who underwent   UTKA, using aspirin or warfarin as VTE prophylaxis. Each patient   was assigned an individualised baseline VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> score based on   a system using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Symptomatic VTE,   including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT),   were identified in the first 90 days post-operatively.

Similarly, the adjusted incidence of VTE following   SBTKA was 1.6% (95% CI 1.1 to 2.3) with aspirin and 2.5% (95% CI   1.9 to 3.3) with warfarin. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of PE and VTE were reduced by   66% (odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.78) and 38% (OR 0.62,   95% CI 0.38 to 1.0), respectively, using aspirin.

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statins are effective in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline expands recommended statin use, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness has not been compared with other guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness of the ACC/AHA guideline relative to current use, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and universal statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age over a 10-year horizon from 2016 to 2025. Sensitivity analyses varied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong>-effectiveness ratios and numbers needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal number needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than women. Results vary moderately with different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> thresholds for instituting statins and statin toxicity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates but depend greatly on the disutility caused by daily medication use (pill burden).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>At a population level, the ACC/AHA guideline for expanded statin use for primary prevention is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">project</span></strong>ed to treat more people, to save more lives, and to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> less compared with Adult Treatment Panel III in both men and women. Whether individuals benefit from long-term statin use for primary prevention depends more on the disutility associated with pill burden than their degree of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Patients with T1DM were categorized according to number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors not at target: glycohemoglobin, blood pressure, albuminuria, smoking, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization, and stroke was examined in relation to the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors at target.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean follow-up was 10.4 years in the diabetes group.

Tree Physiology
Measuring the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx in tree stem respiration
<p>In recent studies, the ratio of tree stem CO<sub>2</sub> efflux to O<sub>2</sub> influx has been defined as the apparent respiratory quotient (ARQ). The metabolism of carbohydrates, the putative respiratory substrate in trees, is expected to yield an ARQ of 1.0. However, previous studies have reported ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es ranging between 0.23 and 0.90. These interesting results may indicate internal transport of respired CO<sub>2</sub> within stems; yet no simple field applicable methods for ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement have been available. Here, we report on the assembly of a closed circulating system called ‘<i>Hampadah</i>’, which uses CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> analyzers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from stem chambers. We tested the performance of the <i>Hampadah</i> with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es from 36 trees (<i>Tetragastris panamensis</i> (Engl.) Kuntze). Additionally, we showed the feasibility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing ARQ directly from stem chambers, using portable CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> sensors, in both discrete and continuous modes of operation. The <i>Hampadah</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement proved to be consistent with CO<sub>2</sub> gas standards (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.999) and with O<sub>2</sub> determined by O<sub>2</sub>/Ar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements with a mass spectrometer (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.998). The <i>Hampadah</i> gave highly reproducible results for ARQ determination of field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es (±0.01 for duplicates). The portable sensors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ement showed good correlation with the <i>Hampadah</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ing CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> and ARQ (<i>n</i> = 5, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.97, 0.98 and 0.91, respectively). We have demonstrated here that the <i>Hampadah</i> and the sensors’ methods enable accurate ARQ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements for both laboratory and field research.</p>

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study examines whether associations between air pollution and heart disease mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract.

Interaction terms were used to examine differences in the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mortality association by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 65 936 of the full <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e died during follow-up, and 22 152 died from heart disease. After adjustment for several factors, we found a significant positive association between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and heart disease mortality (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.25). This association was similar in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e adults with adjustment for smoking and body mass index (hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.31).

Contemporary Assessment of Left Ventricular Diastolic Function in Older Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although age-associated changes in left ventricular diastolic function are well recognized, limited data exist characterizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es of diastolic function in older adults, including both reference ranges reflecting the older adult population and prognostically relevant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es for incident heart failure (HF), as well as their associations with circulating biomarkers of HF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Among 5801 elderly participants in the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> in Communities; age range, 67–90 years; mean age, 76±5 years; 42% male; 21% black), we determined the continuous association of diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es (tissue Doppler imaging [TDI] e’, E/e’, and left atrial size) with concomitant N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and subsequent HF hospitalization or death. We also determined sex-specific 10th and 90th percentile limits for these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es using quantile regression in 401 participants free of prevalent cardiovascular disease and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>e of diastolic function was robustly associated with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and incident HF or death. ARIC-based reference limits for TDI e’ (4.6 and 5.2 cm/s for septal and lateral TDI e’, respectively) were substantially lower than guideline cut points (7 and 10 cm/s, respectively), whereas E/e’ and left atrial size demonstrated good agreement with guideline cut points. TDI e’ was nonlinearly associated with incident HF or death, with inflection points for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> supportive of ARIC-based limits. ARIC-based limits for diastolic function improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> discrimination over guideline-based cut points based on the integrated discrimination improvement (<i>P</i><0.001) and continuous net reclassification improvement (<i>P</i><0.001), reclassifying 42% of the study population as having normal diastolic function. We replicate these findings in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. With these limits, 46% had normal diastolic function and were at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of HF hospitalization or death (1%/y over a mean 1.7-year follow-up), 49% had 1 or 2 abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es and were at intermediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (2.4%/y), and all 3 diastolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>es were abnormal in 5% who were at high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (7.5%/y).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that left ventricular longitudinal relaxation velocity declines as a part of healthy aging and is largely prognostically benign.

Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per generation; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per generation (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per generation. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

Genetic Predisposition to High Blood Pressure and Lifestyle Factors
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High blood pressure (BP) is a major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of mortality worldwide.

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of cardiac morbidity and mortality among childhood cancer survivors have been described previously. However, little is known about the very long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s of cardiac mortality and whether the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> has decreased among those more recently diagnosed. We investigated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of long-term cardiac mortality among survivors within the recently extended British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a population-based cohort of 34 489 five-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed from 1940 to 2006 and followed up until February 28, 2014, and is the largest cohort to date to assess late cardiac mortality. Standardized mortality ratios and absolute excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>s were used to quantify cardiac mortality excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ate the simultaneous effect of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. Likelihood ratio tests were used to test for heterogeneity and trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 181 cardiac deaths were observed, which was 3.4 times that expected. Survivors were 2.5 times and 5.9 times more at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy/heart failure death, respectively, than expected. Among those >60 years of age, subsequent primary neoplasms, cardiac disease, and other circulatory conditions ac<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">count</span></strong>ed for 31%, 22%, and 15% of all excess deaths, respectively, providing clear focus for preventive interventions. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of both overall cardiac and cardiomyopathy/heart failure mortality was greatest among those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989. Specifically, for cardiomyopathy/heart failure deaths, survivors diagnosed from 1980 to 1989 had 28.9 times the excess number of deaths observed for survivors diagnosed either before 1970 or from 1990 on.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Excess cardiac mortality among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer remains increased beyond 50 years of age and has clear messages in terms of prevention strategies. However, the fact that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> was greatest in those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989 suggests that initiatives to reduce cardiotoxicity among those treated more recently may be having a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>able impact.</p></sec>

Echocardiographic Screening for Rheumatic Heart Disease in High and Low Risk Australian Children
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Echocardiographic screening for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is becoming more widespread, but screening studies to date have used different echocardiographic definitions. The World Heart Federation has recently published new criteria for the echocardiographic diagnosis of RHD. We aimed to establish the prevalence of RHD in high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Indigenous Australian children using these criteria and to compare the findings with a group of Australian children at low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for RHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Portable echocardiography was performed on high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Indigenous children aged 5 to15 years living in remote communities of northern Australia. A comparison group of low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, non-Indigenous children living in urban centers was also screened. Echocardiograms were reported in a standardized, blinded fashion. Of 3946 high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> children, 34 met World Heart Federation criteria for definite RHD (prevalence, 8.6 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 6.0–12.0]) and 66 for borderline RHD (prevalence, 16.7 per 1000 [95% confidence interval, 13.0–21.2]). Of 1053 low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> children, none met the criteria for definite RHD, and 5 met the criteria for borderline RHD. High-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> children were more likely to have definite or borderline RHD than low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> children (adjusted odds ratio, 5.7 [95% confidence interval, 2.3–14.1]; <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>The prevalence of definite RHD in high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> Indigenous Australian children approximates what we expected in our population, and no definite RHD was identified in the low-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> group. This study suggests that definite RHD, as defined by the World Heart Federation criteria, is likely to represent true disease.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Frequencies of Known Haplotypes from Pooled Sequence Data
<p>DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es are often pooled, either by experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> or because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e itself is a mixture. For example, when population allele frequencies are of primary interest, individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>es may be pooled together to lower the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cost</span></strong> of sequencing. Alternatively, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e itself may be a mixture of multiple species or strains (e.g., bacterial species comprising a microbiome or pathogen strains in a blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e). We present an expectation–maximization algorithm for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ating haplotype frequencies in a pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e directly from mapped sequence reads, in the case where the possible haplotypes are known. This method is relevant to the analysis of pooled sequencing data from selection experiments, as well as the calculation of proportions of different species within a metagenomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e. Our method outperforms existing methods based on single-site allele frequencies, as well as simple approaches using sequence read data. We have implemented the method in a freely available open-source software tool.</p>

Improving 1-Year Outcomes of Infrainguinal Limb Revascularization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The availability and diversity of lower limb revascularization procedures have increased in England in the past decade. We investigated whether these developments in care have translated to improvements in patient pathways and outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Individual-patient records from Hospital Episode Statistics were used to identify 103 934 patients who underwent endovascular (angioplasty) or surgical (endarterectomy, profundaplasty, or bypass) lower limb revascularization for infrainguinal peripheral artery disease in England between January 2006 and December 2015. Major lower limb amputations and deaths within 1 year after revascularization were ascertained from Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics mortality records.

Improving Assessment of Drug Safety Through Proteomics
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Early detection of adverse effects of novel therapies and understanding of their mechanisms could improve the safety and efficiency of drug development.

Glycerophosphocholine Metabolites and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Adolescents
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Glycerophosphocholine (GPC) metabolites modulate atherosclerosis and thus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Preclinical CVD may start during adolescence. Here, we used targeted serum lipidomics to identify a new panel of GPCs, and tested whether any of these GPCs are associated, in adolescence, with classical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors of CVD, namely excess visceral fat (VF), elevated blood pressure, insulin resistance, and atherogenic dyslipidemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied a population-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e of 990 adolescents (12–18 years, 48% male), as part of the Saguenay Youth Study. Using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, we identified 69 serum GPCs within the 450 to 680 <i>m</i>/<i>z</i> range. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed VF with MRI.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified several novel GPCs that were associated with multiple CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors. Most significantly, PC16:0/2:0 was negatively associated with VF (<i>P</i>=1.4×10<sup>–19</sup>), blood pressure (<i>P</i>=7.7×10<sup>–5</sup>), and fasting triacylglycerols (<i>P</i>=9.0×10<sup>–5</sup>), and PC14:1/0:0 was positively associated with VF (<i>P</i>=3.0×10<sup>–7</sup>), fasting insulin (<i>P</i>=5.4×10<sup>–32</sup>), and triacylglycerols (<i>P</i>=1.4×10<sup>–29</sup>). The Sobel test of mediation revealed that both GPCs mediated their respective relations between VF (as a potential primary exposure) and CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors (as outcomes, <i>P</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es<1.3×10<sup>–3</sup>). Furthermore, a GPC shown recently to predict incident coronary heart disease in older adults, PC18:2/0:0, was associated with several CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in adolescents; these associations were less strong than those with the newly identified GPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified novel GPCs strongly associated with multiple CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in adolescents. These GPCs may be sensitive indicators of obesity-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> for CVD outcomes in adults, and may improve biological understanding of CVD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>.</p></sec>

Inflammatory and Cholesterol Risk in the FOURIER Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Patients With Elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>), the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor evolocumab reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. It is not known whether the efficacy of evolocumab is modified by baseline inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>. We explored the efficacy of evolocumab stratified by baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). We also assessed the importance of inflammatory and residual cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> across the range of on-treatment LDL-C concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients (n=27 564) with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL on a statin were randomly assigned to evolocumab versus placebo and followed for a median of 2.2 years (1.8–2.5). The effects of evolocumab on the primary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization, and the key secondary end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were compared across strata of baseline hsCRP (<1, 1–3, and >3 mg/dL). Outcomes were also assessed across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es for baseline hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C in the entire trial population. Multivariable models adjusted for variables associated with hsCRP and 1-month LDL-C were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 7981 (29%) patients had a baseline hsCRP<1 mg/L, 11 177 (41%) had a hsCRP 1 to 3 mg/L, and 8337 (30%) had a hsCRP >3 mg/L. Median (interquartile range) baseline hsCRP was 1.8 (0.9–3.6) mg/L and levels were not altered by evolocumab (change at 48 weeks of –0.2 mg/dL [–1.0 to 0.4] in both treatment arms). In the placebo arm, patients in higher baseline hsCRP categories experienced significantly higher 3-year Kaplan-Meier rates of the primary and key secondary end points: 12.0%, 13.7%, and 18.1% for the primary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) and 7.4%, 9.1%, and 13.2% for the key secondary end point (<i>P</i><sub>trend</sub><0.0001) for categories of <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/dL, respectively. The relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions for the primary end point and key secondary end point with evolocumab were consistent across hsCRP strata (<i>P</i>-interactions>0.15 for both). In contrast, the absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions with evolocumab tended to be greater in patients with higher hsCRP: 1.6%, 1.8%, and 2.6% and 0.8%, 2.0%, and 3.0%, respectively, for the primary and key secondary end points across hsCRP strata. In adjusted analyses of the association between LDL-C and hsCRP levels and cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong>, both LDL-C and hsCRP were independently associated with the primary outcome (<i>P</i><0.0001 for each).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>LDL-C reduction with evolocumab reduces cardiovascular events across hsCRP strata with greater absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> reductions in patients with higher-baseline hsCRP.

Frequency, Predictors, and Impact of Combined Antiplatelet Therapy on Venous Thromboembolism in Patients With Symptomatic Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies suggest that symptomatic atherosclerosis may be associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Prior randomized studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in recurrent VTE with aspirin monotherapy. Whether VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> is associated with more severe symptomatic atherosclerosis and more intensive antiplatelet therapy reduces VTE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> beyond aspirin monotherapy is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRA2P-TIMI 50 (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) (vorapaxar) and PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) (ticagrelor) were blinded, randomized placebo-controlled trials of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of ischemic events in stable patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis. Two blinded vascular specialists systematically identified symptomatic venous thromboembolic events in both trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 47 611 patients with stable vascular disease followed for 3 years in both studies there were 343 VTE events in 301 patients (Kaplan-Meier rate at 3 years, 0.9% for placebo). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of VTE was independently associated with age, body mass index, polyvascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and malignancy. The burden of atherosclerosis manifested as an increasing number of symptomatic vascular territories was associated with a graded increase in the 3-year rates of VTE (0.76% for 1, 1.53% for 2, and 2.45% for 3 territories). More intensive antiplatelet therapy (vorapaxar and ticagrelor pooled) significantly reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> of VTE by 29% compared with background antiplatelet therapy, from 0.93% to 0.64% at 3 years (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.56–0.89; <i>P</i>=0.003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The rate of VTE in patients with atherosclerosis is ≈0.3% per year while on treatment with ≥1 antiplatelet agent, with increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> independently associated with the number of symptomatic vascular territories.

Risk Factors of Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Prevention of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in the young remains a largely unsolved public health problem, and sports activity is an established trigger. Although the presence of standard cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors in the young can link to future morbidity and mortality in adulthood, the potential contribution of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> factors to SCA in the young has not been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively ascertained subjects who experienced SCA between the ages of 5 and 34 years in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area (2002–2015, catchment population ≈1 million).

In SCA in the young, overall prevalence of warning signs before SCA was low (29%), and 26 (14%) were associated with sports as a trigger. The remainder (n=160) occurred in other settings categorized as nonsports. Sports-related SCAs ac<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">count</span></strong>ed for 39% of SCAs in patients aged ≤18, 13% of SCAs in patients aged 19 to 25, and 7% of SCAs in patients aged 25 to 34.

Overall, the most common SCA-related conditions were sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (31%), coronary artery disease (22%), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (14%).

Long-Term Potassium Monitoring and Dynamics in Heart Failure and Risk of Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The prognostic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>e of long-term potassium monitoring and dynamics in heart failure has not been characterized completely.

The multivariable-adjusted association of serum potassium with mortality was assessed by using comprehensive state-of-the-art regression methods that can accommodate time-dependent exposure modeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sampl</span></strong>e included 2164 patients with a total of 16 116 potassium observations. Mean potassium at discharge was 4.3±0.48 mEq/L. Hypokalemia (<3.5 mEq/L), normokalemia (3.5–5.0 mEq/L), and hyperkalemia (>5 mEq/L) were observed at the index admission in 77 (3.6%), 1965 (90.8%), and 122 (5.6%) patients, respectively. At a median follow-up of 2.8 years (range, 0.03–12.8 years), 1090 patients died (50.4%). On a continuous scale, the multivariable-adjusted association of potassium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es and mortality revealed a nonlinear association (U-shaped) with higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> at both ends of its distribution (omnibus <i>P</i>=0.001).

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to characterize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be standardized to take ac<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">count</span></strong> of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated the time course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–elevation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">risk</span></strong> (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–elevation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were performed: patients with ST-segment–elevation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 mapping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">e<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong></span></strong>ated at all time points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR examinations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference MaR was assessed by contrast-multidetector computed tomography during the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed models were used to take ac<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">count</span></strong> of repeated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation time in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, edema extent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valu</span></strong>es <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">measur</span></strong>ed by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">estim</span></strong></span></strong>ates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–elevation MI edema highlight the need for standardization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a time window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for standardization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

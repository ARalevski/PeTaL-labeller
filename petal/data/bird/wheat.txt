Natural Variation in <i>OsLG3</i> Increases Drought Tolerance in Rice by Inducing ROS Scavenging
<p>Improving the performance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) under drought stress has the potential to significantly affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> productivity. Here, we report that the ERF family transcription factor OsLG3 positively regulates drought tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. In our previous work, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> has a positive effect on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> grain length without affecting grain quality. In this study, we found that <i>OsLG3</i> was more strongly expressed in upland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> than in lowland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> under drought stress conditions. By performing candidate gene association analysis, we found that natural variation in the promoter of <i>OsLG3</i> is associated with tolerance to osmotic stress in germinating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> seeds. Overexpression of <i>OsLG3</i> significantly improved the tolerance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants to simulated drought, whereas suppression of <i>OsLG3</i> resulted in greater susceptibility. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the tolerant allele of <i>OsLG3</i> may improve drought tolerance in cultivated <i>japonica</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. Introgression lines and complementation transgenic lines containing the elite allele of <i>OsLG3</i><sup>IRAT109</sup> showed increased drought tolerance, demonstrating that natural variation in <i>OsLG3</i> contributes to drought tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. Further investigation suggested that <i>OsLG3</i> plays a positive role in drought stress tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> by inducing reactive oxygen species scavenging. Collectively, our findings reveal that natural variation in <i>OsLG3</i> contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> drought tolerance and that the elite allele of <i>OsLG3</i> is a promising genetic resource for the development of drought-tolerant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> varieties.</p>

<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Induces the Expression of a MicroRNA to Suppress the Immune Response in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs play crucial roles in plant responses to pathogen infections. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blast disease, caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most important disease of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). To explore the microRNA species that participate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> immunity against the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blast disease, we compared the expression of small RNAs between mock- and <i>M. oryzae</i>-treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. We found that infection by <i>M. oryzae</i> strain Guy11 specifically induced the expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> miR319 and, consequently, suppressed its target gene <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR1</i> (<i>OsTCP21</i>), which encodes a transcription factor. Using transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> that overexpresses miR319b (OE) or expresses <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res (which is resistant to miR319-mediated silencing), we found that <i>OsTCP21</i> is a positive regulator of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> defense response against the blast disease. When wild-type and miR319b-OE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> were infected by Guy11, multiple jasmonic acid (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating that Guy11 suppresses JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that <i>LIPOXYGENASE2</i> (<i>LOX2</i>) and <i>LOX5</i> were specifically suppressed by miR319 overexpression or by Guy11 infection. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA synthesis, which catalyze the conversion of α-linoleic acid to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid. The application of α-linoleic acid rescued disease symptoms on the <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> but not wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, supporting our hypothesis that <i>OsLOX2</i> and <i>OsLOX5</i> are the key JA synthesis genes hijacked by Guy11 to subvert host immunity and facilitate pathogenicity. We propose that induced expression of <i>OsLOX2/5</i> may improve resistance to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blast disease.</p>

MicroRNA166 Modulates Cadmium Tolerance and Accumulation in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20- to 24-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. Several plant miRNAs, such as miR166, have vital roles in plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses. One such environmental stress encountered by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> plants is exposure to cadmium (Cd), an element highly toxic to most organisms, including humans and plants. In this study, we analyzed the role of miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The expression levels of miR166 in both root and leaf tissues were significantly higher in the reproductive stage than in the seedling stage in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. The expression of miR166 in the roots of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> seedlings was reduced after Cd treatment. Overexpression of miR166 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> improved Cd tolerance, a result associated with the reduction of Cd-induced oxidative stress in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants. Furthermore, overexpression of miR166 reduced both Cd translocation from roots to shoots and Cd accumulation in the grains. miR166 targets genes encoding the class-III homeodomain-Leu zipper (HD-Zip) family proteins in plants. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>) gene (Os03g43930), which encodes an HD-Zip protein, was up-regulated by Cd treatment but down-regulated by overexpression of miR166 in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants. Overexpression of <i>OsHB4</i> increased Cd sensitivity and Cd accumulation in the leaves and grains of transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants. By contrast, silencing <i>OsHB4</i> by RNA interference enhanced Cd tolerance in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants. These results indicate a critical role for miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance through regulation of its target gene, <i>OsHB4</i>, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>.</p>

OsSYP121 Accumulates at Fungal Penetration Sites and Mediates Host Resistance to Rice Blast
<p><i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> is a fungal pathogen that causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) blast. SNAREs (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) are key components in vesicle trafficking in eukaryotic cells and are known to contribute to fungal pathogen resistance. Syntaxin of Plants121 (SYP121), a Qa-SNARE, has been reported to function in nonhost resistance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the functions of SYP121 in host resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blast are largely unknown. Here, we report that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> SYP121 protein, OsSYP121, accumulates at fungal penetration sites and mediates host resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blast. OsSYP121 is plasma membrane localized and its expression was obviously induced by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blast in both the blast-resistant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> landrace Heikezijing and the blast-susceptible landrace Suyunuo (Su). Overexpression of <i>OsSYP121</i> in Su resulted in enhanced resistance to blast. Knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in Su resulted in a more susceptible phenotype. However, knockdown of <i>OsSYP121</i> expression in the resistant landrace Heikezijing resulted in susceptibility to the blast fungus. The <i>P<sub>OsSYP121</sub></i>::GFP-OsSYP121 accumulated at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blast penetration sites in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, as observed by confocal microscopy. Yeast two-hybrid results showed that OsSYP121 can interact with OsSNAP32 (Synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kD) and Vesicle-associated membrane protein714/724. The interaction between OsSYP121 and OsSNAP32 may contribute to host resistance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blast. Our study reveals that OsSYP121 plays an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blast resistance as it is a key component in vesicle trafficking.</p>

<i>ESA1</i> Is Involved in Embryo Sac Abortion in Interspecific Hybrid Progeny of Rice
<p>The emergence of sterile individuals in the hybrid backcross progeny of wild and cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> limits the use of wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> alleles for improving cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this sterility remain unclear. Here, we identified the semisterile introgression line YIL42, derived from a cross between the <i>indica</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> variety Teqing (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Oryza rufipogon</i> accession YJCWR (Yuanjiang common wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>), which exhibits semisterility. Using positional cloning, we isolated <i>EMBRYO SAC ABORTION 1</i> (<i>ESA1</i>), which encodes a nuclear-membrane localized protein containing an armadillo repeat domain. A mutation in <i>ESA1</i> at position 1819 (<sup>T</sup>1819<sup>C</sup>) converts a stop codon into an Arg (R) codon, causing delayed termination of protein translation. Analysis of transgenic lines indicated that the difference in ESA1 protein structure between <i>O. rufipogon</i>–derived <i>ESA1</i> and Teqing-derived <i>esa1</i> affects female gamete abortion during early mitosis. Fertility investigation and expression analysis indicated that the interaction between <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> and unknown gene(s) of Teqing affects spikelet fertility of the hybrid backcross progeny. The <i>ESA1</i><sup>T1819</sup> allele is present in <i>O. rufipogon</i> but absent in <i>O. sativa</i>, suggesting that variation in <i>ESA1</i> may be associated with interspecific hybrid incompatibility between wild and cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism underlying female sterility, which is useful for improving the panicle seed setting rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> and for developing a strategy to overcome interspecific hybrid sterility between cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> and wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>.</p>

A <i>Magnaporthe</i> Chitinase Interacts with a Rice Jacalin-Related Lectin to Promote Host Colonization
<p>The genome of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blast fungus (<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>) encodes 15 glycoside hydrolase 18 family chitinases. In this study, we characterized the function of an <i>M. oryzae</i> extracellular chitinase, MoChi1, and its interaction with a host protein, OsMBL1, a jacalin-related Mannose-Binding Lectin (MBL) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Deletion of <i>MoChi1</i> resulted in reduced aerial hyphal formation and reduced virulence in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> by activating the expression of defense-responsive genes. We confirmed MoChi1 interaction with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> OsMBL1 in vitro and in vivo. <i>OsMBL1</i> was induced by pathogen-associated molecular patterns and <i>M. oryzae</i> infection. Overexpression of <i>OsMBL1</i> led to activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> defense-responsive genes and a chitin-induced reactive oxygen species burst, thereby enhancing resistance to <i>M. oryzae</i>. Knockdown of <i>OsMBL1</i> enhances susceptibility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants to <i>M. oryzae</i>. Furthermore, MoChi1 suppressed chitin-induced reactive oxygen species in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> cells and competed with OsMBL1 for chitin binding. Taken together, our study reveals a mechanism in which MoChi1 targets a host lectin to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> immunity.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield potential.</p>

Ethylene-gibberellin signaling underlies adaptation of rice to periodic flooding
<p>Most plants do poorly when flooded. Certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> varieties, known as deepwater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, survive periodic flooding and consequent oxygen deficiency by activating internode growth of stems to keep above the water. Here, we identify the gibberellin biosynthesis gene, <i>SD1</i> (<i>SEMIDWARF1</i>), whose loss-of-function allele catapulted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> Green Revolution, as being responsible for submergence-induced internode elongation. When submerged, plants carrying the deepwater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>–specific <i>SD1</i> haplotype amplify a signaling relay in which the <i>SD1</i> gene is transcriptionally activated by an ethylene-responsive transcription factor, OsEIL1a. The SD1 protein directs increased synthesis of gibberellins, largely GA<sub>4</sub>, which promote internode elongation. Evolutionary analysis shows that the deepwater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>–specific haplotype was derived from standing variation in wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> and selected for deepwater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> cultivation in Bangladesh.</p>

Time-Course Transcriptomics Analysis Reveals Key Responses of Submerged Deepwater Rice to Flooding
<p>Water submergence is an environmental factor that limits plant growth and survival. Deepwater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) adapts to submergence by rapidly elongating its internodes and thereby maintaining its leaves above the water surface. We performed a comparative RNA sequencing transcriptome analysis of the shoot base region, including basal nodes, internodes, and shoot apices of seedlings at two developmental stages from two varieties with contrasting deepwater growth responses. A transcriptomic comparison between deepwater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> cv C9285 and nondeepwater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> cv Taichung 65 revealed both similar and differential expression patterns between the two genotypes during submergence. The expression of genes related to gibberellin biosynthesis, trehalose biosynthesis, anaerobic fermentation, cell wall modification, and transcription factors that include ethylene-responsive factors was significantly different between the varieties. Interestingly, in both varieties, the jasmonic acid content at the shoot base decreased during submergence, while exogenous jasmonic acid inhibited submergence-induced internode elongation in cv C9285, suggesting that jasmonic acid plays a role in the submergence response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. Furthermore, a targeted de novo transcript assembly revealed transcripts that were specific to cv C9285, including submergence-induced biotic stress-related genes. Our multifaceted transcriptome approach using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> shoot base region illustrates a differential response to submergence between deepwater and nondeepwater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. Jasmonic acid metabolism appears to participate in the submergence-mediated internode elongation response of deepwater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer drought resistance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these plants exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants under drought stress. The leaves of STTM166 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 plants had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants overexpressing a miR166-resistant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 plants, including leaf rolling and higher drought resistance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that drought resistance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic plants’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of metabolites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been achieved via metabolic engineering in cereals, but the potential connection between metabolic engineering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of engineered High Free Lysine (HFL) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key metabolites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely linked with dark-brown endosperm color in HFL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. A functional connection between serotonin and endosperm color was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, coinciding with serotonin accumulation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the metabolic connection between Lys and serotonin metabolism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin accumulation, and the brown phenotype in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid metabolism in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. In addition, the finding that both Lys and serotonin accumulate in HFL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>.</p>

Two h-Type Thioredoxins Interact with the E2 Ubiquitin Conjugase PHO2 to Fine-Tune Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice
<p><i>Phosphate overaccumulator2</i> (<i>PHO2</i>) encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme that is a major negative regulator of the inorganic phosphate (Pi)-starvation response-signaling pathway. A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; Os) using OsPHO2 as bait revealed an interaction between OsPHO2 and two h-type thioredoxins, OsTrxh1 and OsTrxh4. These interactions were confirmed in vivo using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) of OsPHO2 and OsTrxh1/h4 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> protoplasts and by in vitro pull-down assays with 6His-tagged OsTrxh1/h4 and GST-tagged OsPHO2. Y2H assays revealed that amino acid Cys-445 of OsPHO2 and an N-terminal Cys in the “WCGPC” motif of Trxhs were required for the interaction. Split-ubiquitin Y2H analyses and BiFC assays in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> protoplasts confirmed the interaction of OsPHO2 with PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (OsPHF1), and PHOSPHATE1;2 (OsPHO1;2) in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membrane system, where OsPHO2 mediates the degradation of OsPHF1 in both tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> seedlings. Characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <i>pho2</i> complemented lines, transformed with an endogenous genomic <i>OsPHO2</i> or <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> (a constitutively reduced form) fragment, indicated that <i>OsPHO2<sup>C445S</sup></i> restored Pi concentration in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> to statistically significant lower levels compared to native <i>OsPHO2</i>. Moreover, the suppression of <i>OsTrxh1</i> (knockdown and knockout) resulted in slightly higher Pi concentration than that of wild-type Nipponbare in leaves. These results demonstrate that OsPHO2 is under redox control by thioredoxins, which fine-tune its activity and link Pi homeostasis with redox balance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>.</p>

OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 Function as Arsenate Reductases and Regulate Arsenic Accumulation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> is a major dietary source of the toxic metalloid arsenic (As). Reducing its accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) grain is of critical importance to food safety. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> roots take up arsenate and arsenite depending on the prevailing soil conditions. The first step of arsenate detoxification is its reduction to arsenite, but the enzyme(s) catalyzing this reaction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> remains unknown. Here, we identify OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 as arsenate reductases in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. <i>OsHAC1;1</i> and <i>OsHAC1;2</i> are able to complement an <i>Escherichia coli</i> mutant lacking the endogenous arsenate reductase and to reduce arsenate to arsenite. <i>OsHAC1:1</i> and <i>OsHAC1;2</i> are predominantly expressed in roots, with <i>OsHAC1;1</i> being abundant in the epidermis, root hairs, and pericycle cells while <i>OsHAC1;2</i> is abundant in the epidermis, outer layers of cortex, and endodermis cells. Expression of the two genes was induced by arsenate exposure. Knocking out <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> decreased the reduction of arsenate to arsenite in roots, reducing arsenite efflux to the external medium. Loss of arsenite efflux was also associated with increased As accumulation in shoots. Greater effects were observed in a double mutant of the two genes. In contrast, overexpression of either <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> increased arsenite efflux, reduced As accumulation, and enhanced arsenate tolerance. When grown under aerobic soil conditions, overexpression of either <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> also decreased As accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> grain, whereas grain As increased in the knockout mutants. We conclude that OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 are arsenate reductases that play an important role in restricting As accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> shoots and grain.</p>

A Critical Role of Sodium Flux via the Plasma Membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Exchanger SOS1 in the Salt Tolerance of Rice
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) stands among the world's most important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> species. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> is salt sensitive, and the undue accumulation of sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) in shoots has the strongest negative correlation with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> productivity under long-term salinity. The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger protein Salt Overly Sensitive 1 (SOS1) is the sole Na<sup>+</sup> efflux transporter that has been genetically characterized to date. Here, the importance of SOS1-facilitated Na<sup>+</sup> flux in the salt tolerance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> was analyzed in a reverse-genetics approach. A <i>sos1</i> loss-of-function mutant displayed exceptional salt sensitivity that was correlated with excessive Na<sup>+</sup> intake and impaired Na<sup>+</sup> loading into the xylem, thus indicating that SOS1 controls net root Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and long-distance Na<sup>+</sup> transport to shoots. The acute Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of <i>sos1</i> plants at low NaCl concentrations allowed analysis of the transcriptional response to sodicity stress without effects of the osmotic stress intrinsic to high-salinity treatments. In contrast with that in the wild type, <i>sos1</i> mutant roots displayed preferential down-regulation of stress-related genes in response to salt treatment, despite the greater intensity of stress experienced by the mutant. These results suggest there is impaired stress detection or an inability to mount a comprehensive response to salinity in <i>sos1</i>. In summary, the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger SOS1 plays a major role in the salt tolerance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> by controlling Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and possibly contributing to the sensing of sodicity stress.</p>

<i>PINOID</i> Is Required for Formation of the Stigma and Style in Rice
<p>The stigma is the entry point for sexual reproduction in plants, but the mechanisms underlying stigma development are largely unknown. Here, we disrupted putative auxin biosynthetic and signaling genes to evaluate their roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) development. Disruption of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <i>PINOID</i> (<i>OsPID</i>) gene completely eliminated the development of stigmas, and overexpression of <i>OsPID</i> led to overproliferation of stigmas, suggesting that <i>OsPID</i> is a key determinant for stigma development. Interestingly, <i>ospid</i> mutants did not display defects in flower initiation, nor did they develop any pin-like inflorescences, a characteristic phenotype observed in <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We constructed double mutants of <i>OsPID</i> and its closest homolog, <i>OsPIDb</i>, yet the double mutants still did not develop any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either <i>ospid</i> is compensated by additional homologous genes or <i>OsPID</i> has different functions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> compared with <i>PID</i> in other organisms. We then knocked out one of the <i>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS</i> (<i>NPY</i>) genes, which cause the formation of pin-like inflorescences in Arabidopsis when compromised, in the <i>ospid</i> background. The <i>ospid osnpy2</i> double mutants developed pin-like inflorescences, which were phenotypically similar to <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis and maize, demonstrating that the roles of <i>OsPID</i> in inflorescence development are likely masked by redundant partners. This work identified a key determinant for stigma development in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> and revealed a complex picture of the <i>PID</i> gene in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> development. Furthermore, the stigma-less <i>ospid</i> mutants are potentially useful in producing hybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>.</p>

A Group D MAPK Protects Plants from Autotoxicity by Suppressing Herbivore-Induced Defense Signaling
<p>The mechanisms by which plants activate and enhance defense responses have been well studied; however, the regulatory mechanisms that allow plants to avoid excessive defense responses are poorly understood. Here, we identified a group D mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>OsMAPK20-5</i>, whose expression was rapidly induced by infestation of gravid female adults of a destructive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> pest, brown planthopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>), but not by BPH nymphs. Expression silencing of <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) after gravid female BPH infestation, and thereby increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plant resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs. However, when exposed to high densities of gravid BPH females, irMAPK plants wilted earlier than wild-type plants, which could be attributed to the hyperaccumulation of ethylene and NO in irMAPK plants. Interestingly, when released into the field, irMAPK plants displayed broad resistance to BPH and white-backed planthopper (<i>Sogatella furcifera</i>), the two most destructive pests of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, and produced higher yield. Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants to planthoppers, it also enables <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense-response–related autotoxicity.</p>

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in angiosperms, rapid tip growth in pollen tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton within the pollen tube plays a crucial role in this polarized process. However, the mechanism underlying the polarity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in pollen tube growth remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-organizing protein, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls pollen tube growth by modulating the polarity and distribution of the F-actin array. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal pollen tube growth and a decreased germination rate of the pollen grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> pollen tubes display a disorganized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin polarity during tip growth. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> pollen tube, which is essential for pollen tube growth and polarity as well as F-actin organization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> pollen tube growth. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of pollen tube growth via modulating F-actin organization and array orientation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. This work provides insights into tip-focused cell growth and polarity.</p>

Ribosomal RNA Biogenesis and Its Response to Chilling Stress in <i>Oryza sativa</i>
<p>Ribosome biogenesis is crucial for plant growth and environmental acclimation. Processing of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) is an essential step in ribosome biogenesis and begins with transcription of the rDNA. The resulting precursor-rRNA (pre-rRNA) transcript undergoes systematic processing, where multiple endonucleolytic and exonucleolytic cleavages remove the external and internal transcribed spacers (ETS and ITS). The processing sites and pathways for pre-rRNA processing have been deciphered in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and, to some extent, in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, mammalian cells, and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the processing sites and pathways remain largely unknown in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s, particularly in monocots such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), one of the most important food resources in the world. Here, we identified the rRNA precursors produced during rRNA biogenesis and the critical endonucleolytic cleavage sites in the transcribed spacer regions of pre-rRNAs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. We further found that two pre-rRNA processing pathways, distinguished by the order of 5′ ETS removal and ITS1 cleavage, coexist in vivo. Moreover, exposing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> to chilling stress resulted in the inhibition of rRNA biogenesis mainly at the pre-rRNA processing level, suggesting that these energy-intensive processes may be reduced to increase acclimation and survival at lower temperatures. Overall, our study identified the pre-rRNA processing pathway in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> and showed that ribosome biogenesis is quickly inhibited by low temperatures, which may shed light on the link between ribosome biogenesis and environmental acclimation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> plants.</p>

Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic plant that is well adapted to partial flooding. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the plant gets flooded, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root system upon flooding. AR growth is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged plant tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root system in flooded <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and growth of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of growth direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120° in the dark and downward at 54° in the light. The upward growth direction is conserved in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> varieties, suggestive of a conserved trait in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward growth by about 10°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative phototropism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR system architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile phototropism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the phototropin-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward growth) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward growth).</p>

Rice Leaf Angle and Grain Size Are Affected by the OsBUL1 Transcriptional Activator Complex<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> atypical HLH protein <i>Oryza sativa BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED 1</i>-<i>LIKE1</i> (<i>OsBUL1</i>) is preferentially expressed in the lamina joint where it controls cell elongation and positively affects leaf angles. <i>OsBUL1</i> knockout mutant (<i>osbul1</i>) and transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> for double-stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) of <i>OsBUL1</i> produced erect leaves with smaller grains, whereas <i>OsBUL1</i> overexpressors and an activation tagging line of <i>OsBUL1</i> exhibited increased lamina inclination and grain size. Moreover, <i>OsBUL1</i> expression was induced by brassinolide (BL) and <i>osbul1</i> did not respond to BL treatment. To understand the molecular network of OsBUL1 function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, we isolated a novel OsBUL1-interacting protein, LO9-177, an uncharacterized protein containing a KxDL motif, and functionally studied it with respect to the lamina inclination and grain size of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. OsBUL1 COMPLEX1 (OsBC1) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator that interacts with OsBUL1 only in the presence of LO9-177 forming a possible trimeric complex for cell elongation in the lamina joint of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. Expression of <i>OsBC1</i> is also upregulated by BL and has a similar pattern to that of <i>OsBUL1</i>. Transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants expressing <i>OsBC1</i> under the control of <i>OsBUL1</i> promoter showed increased grain size as well as leaf bending, while transgenic lines for dsRNAi and/or expressing a dominant repressor form of <i>OsBC1</i> displayed reduced plant height and grain size. Together, these results demonstrated that a novel protein complex consisting of OsBUL1, LO9-177, and OsBC1 is associated with the HLH-bHLH system, providing new insight into the molecular functional network based on HLH-bHLH proteins for cell elongation.</p>

Systems Genetics Identifies a Novel Regulatory Domain of Amylose Synthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>A deeper understanding of the regulation of starch biosynthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is crucial in tailoring digestibility without sacrificing grain quality. In this study, significant association peaks on chromosomes 6 and 7 were identified through a genomewide association study (GWAS) of debranched starch structure from grains of a 320 <i>indica</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> diversity panel using genotyping data from the high-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> array. A systems genetics approach that interrelates starch structure data from GWAS to functional pathways from a gene regulatory network identified known genes with high correlation to the proportion of amylose and amylopectin. An SNP in the promoter region of <i>Granule Bound Starch Synthase I</i> was identified along with seven other SNPs to form haplotypes that discriminate samples into different phenotypic ranges of amylose. A GWAS peak on chromosome 7 between LOC_Os07g11020 and LOC_Os07g11520 indexed by a nonsynonymous SNP mutation on exon 5 of a bHLH transcription factor was found to elevate the proportion of amylose at the expense of reduced short-chain amylopectin. Linking starch structure with starch digestibility by determining the kinetics of cooked grain amylolysis of selected haplotypes revealed strong association of starch structure with estimated digestibility kinetics. Combining all results from grain quality genomics, systems genetics, and digestibility phenotyping, we propose target haplotypes for fine-tuning starch structure in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> through marker-assisted breeding that can be used to alter the digestibility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> grain, thus offering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> consumers a new diet-based intervention to mitigate the impact of nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases.</p>

INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 Recruits Histone Deacetylase and a Transcriptional Repression Complex to Regulate Rice Salt Tolerance
<p>Perception and transduction of salt stress signals are critical for plant survival, growth, and propagation. Thus, identification of components of the salt stress-signaling pathway is important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) molecular breeding of salt stress resistance. Here, we report the identification of an apetala2/ethylene response factor transcription factor INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 (IDS1) and its roles in the regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> salt tolerance. By genetic screening and phenotype analysis, we demonstrated that IDS1 conferred transcriptional repression activity and acted as a negative regulator of salt tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. To identify potential downstream target genes regulated by IDS1, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing and ChIP-quantitative PCR assays and found that IDS1 may directly associate with the GCC-box-containing motifs in the promoter regions of abiotic stress-responsive genes, including <i>LEA1</i> (<i>LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEIN1</i>) and <i>SOS1</i> (<i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i>), which are key genes regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> salt tolerance. IDS1 physically interacted with the transcriptional corepressor topless-related 1 and the histone deacetylase HDA1, contributing to the repression of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> expression. Analyses of histone H3 acetylation status and RNA polymerase II occupation on the promoters of <i>LEA1</i> and <i>SOS1</i> further defined the molecular foundation of the transcriptional repression activity of IDS1. Our findings illustrate an epigenetic mechanism by which IDS1 modulates salt stress signaling as well as salt tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>.</p>

Functional Diversity of Diterpene Synthases in the Biofuel Crop Switchgrass
<p>Diterpenoids constitute a diverse class of metabolites with critical functions in plant development, defense, and ecological adaptation. Major monocot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s, such as maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), deploy diverse blends of specialized diterpenoids as core components of biotic and abiotic stress resilience. Here, we describe the genome-wide identification and functional characterization of stress-related diterpene synthases (diTPSs) in the dedicated bioenergy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>). Mining of the allotetraploid switchgrass genome identified an expansive diTPS family of 31 members, and biochemical analysis of 11 diTPSs revealed a modular metabolic network producing a diverse array of diterpenoid metabolites. In addition to <i>ent</i>-copalyl diphosphate (CPP) and <i>ent</i>-kaurene synthases predictably involved in gibberellin biosynthesis, we identified <i>syn</i>-CPP and <i>ent</i>-labda-13-en-8-ol diphosphate (LPP) synthases as well as two diTPSs forming (+)-labda-8,13<i>E</i>-dienyl diphosphate (8,13-CPP) and <i>ent-neo-</i>cis-trans-clerodienyl diphosphate (CT-CLPP) scaffolds not observed previously in plants. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the (+)-8,13-CPP and <i>ent-neo-</i>CT-CLPP synthases revealed residue substitutions in the active sites that altered product outcome, representing potential neofunctionalization events that occurred during diversification of the switchgrass diTPS family. The conversion of <i>ent</i>-CPP, <i>ent</i>-LPP, <i>syn</i>-CPP, and <i>ent-neo</i>-CT-CLPP by promiscuous diTPSs further yielded distinct labdane-type diterpene olefins and alcohols. Of these metabolites, the formation of 9β-hydroxy-<i>syn</i>-pimar-15-ene and the expression of the corresponding genes were induced in roots and leaves in response to oxidative stress and ultraviolet irradiation, indicating their possible roles in abiotic stress adaptation. Together, these findings expand the known chemical space of diterpenoid metabolism in monocot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s toward systematically investigating and ultimately improving stress resilience traits in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> species.</p>

OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-Type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution
<p>Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Cu trafficking and distribution to different organs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we report the function and role of Antioxidant Protein1 (OsATX1), a Cu chaperone in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. Knocking out <i>OsATX1</i> resulted in increased Cu concentrations in roots, whereas <i>OsATX1</i> overexpression reduced root Cu concentrations but increased Cu accumulation in the shoots. At the reproductive stage, the concentrations of Cu in developing tissues, including panicles, upper nodes and internodes, younger leaf blades, and leaf sheaths of the main tiller, were increased significantly in <i>OsATX1</i>-overexpressing plants and decreased in <i>osatx1</i> mutants compared with the wild type. The <i>osatx1</i> mutants also showed a higher Cu concentration in older leaves. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsATX1 interacts with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases HMA4, HMA5, HMA6, and HMA9. These results suggest that OsATX1 may function to deliver Cu to heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases for Cu trafficking and distribution in order to maintain Cu homeostasis in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> tissues. In addition, heterologous expression of <i>OsATX1</i> in the yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) cadmium-sensitive mutant Δ<i>ycf1</i> increased the tolerance to Cu and cadmium by decreasing their respective concentrations in the transformed yeast cells. Taken together, our results indicate that OsATX1 plays an important role in facilitating root-to-shoot Cu translocation and the redistribution of Cu from old leaves to developing tissues and seeds in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>.</p>

Identification of Genes Related to Cold Tolerance and a Functional Allele That Confers Cold Tolerance
<p>Cold stress is a major factor limiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide, especially at the seedling and booting stages. The identification of genes associated with cold tolerance (CT) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> is important for sustainable food production. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide association study to identify the genetic loci associated with CT by using a 1,033-accession diversity panel. We identified five CT-related genetic loci at the booting stage. Accessions carrying multiple cold-tolerant alleles displayed a higher seed-setting rate than did accessions that had no cold-tolerant alleles or carried a single allele. At the seedling stage, eight genetic loci related to CT have been identified. Among these, <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> was identified as the candidate gene for the <i>qPSR10</i> genetic locus that is associated with CT in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> seedlings. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SNP2<sup>G</sup>, at position 343 in <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> is responsible for conferring CT at the seedling stage in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. Further analysis of the haplotype network revealed that SNP2<sup>G</sup> was present in 80.08% of the temperate <i>japonica</i> accessions but only 3.8% of the <i>indica</i> ones. We used marker-assisted selection to construct a series of BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>3</sub> near-isogenic lines possessing the cold-tolerant allele SNP2<sup>G</sup>. When subjected to cold stress, plants carrying SNP2<sup>G</sup> survived better as seedlings and showed higher grain weight than plants carrying the SNP2<sup>A</sup> allele. The CT-related loci identified here and the functional verification of <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> will provide genetic resources for breeding cold-tolerant varieties and for studying the molecular basis of CT in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>.</p>

OsbZIP48, a HY5 Transcription Factor Ortholog, Exerts Pleiotropic Effects in Light-Regulated Development
<p>Plants have evolved an intricate network of sensory photoreceptors and signaling components to regulate their development. Among the light signaling components identified to date, HY5, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, has been investigated extensively. However, most of the work on HY5 has been carried out in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), a dicot. In this study, based on homology search and phylogenetic analysis, we identified three homologs of AtHY5 in monocots; however, AtHYH (HY5 homolog) homologs are absent in the monocots analyzed. Out of the three homologs identified in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), we have functionally characterized <i>OsbZIP48</i>. <i>OsbZIP48</i> was able to complement the <i>Athy5</i> mutant. OsbZIP48 protein levels are developmentally regulated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. Moreover, the OsbZIP48 protein does not degrade in dark-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> and <i>Athy5</i> seedlings complemented with <i>OsbZIP48</i>, which is in striking contrast to AtHY5. In comparison with <i>AtHY5</i>, which does not cause any change in hypocotyl length when overexpressed in Arabidopsis, the overexpression of full-length <i>OsbZIP48</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> transgenics reduced the plant height considerably. Microarray analysis revealed that <i>OsKO2</i>, which encodes <i>ent</i>-kaurene oxidase 2 of the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway, is down-regulated in <i>OsbZIP48<sup>OE</sup></i> and up-regulated in <i>OsbZIP48<sup>KD</sup></i> transgenics as compared with the wild type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsbZIP48 binds directly to the <i>OsKO2</i> promoter. The RNA interference lines and the T-DNA insertional mutant of <i>OsbZIP48</i> showed seedling-lethal phenotypes despite the fact that roots were more proliferative during early stages of development in the T-DNA insertional mutant. These data provide credible evidence that OsbZIP48 performs more diverse functions in a monocot system like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> in comparison with its Arabidopsis ortholog, HY5.</p>

MiR408 Regulates Grain Yield and Photosynthesis via a Phytocyanin Protein
<p>Increasing grain yield is the most important object of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> breeding. Here, we report that the elevated expression of a conserved microRNA, OsmiR408, could positively regulate grain yield in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) by increasing panicle branches and grain number. We further showed that OsmiR408 regulates grain yield by down-regulating its downstream target, <i>OsUCL8</i>, which is an uclacyanin (UCL) gene of the phytocyanin family. The knock down or knock out of <i>OsUCL8</i> also increases grain yield, while the overexpression of <i>OsUCL8</i> results in an opposite phenotype. Spatial and temporal expression analyses showed that <i>OsUCL8</i> was highly expressed in pistils, young panicles, developing seeds, and inflorescence meristem and was nearly complementary to that of OsmiR408. Interestingly, the OsUCL8 protein was localized to the cytoplasm, distinct from a majority of phytocyanins, which localize to the plasma membrane. Further studies revealed that the cleavage of <i>OsUCL8</i> by miR408 affects copper homeostasis in the plant cell, which, in turn, affects the abundance of plastocyanin proteins and photosynthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the effects of miR408-<i>OsUCL8</i> in regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> photosynthesis and grain yield.

The Conserved and Unique Genetic Architecture of Kernel Size and Weight in Maize and Rice
<p>Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a major staple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>. Maize kernel size and weight are important contributors to its yield. Here, we measured kernel length, kernel width, kernel thickness, hundred kernel weight, and kernel test weight in 10 recombinant inbred line populations and dissected their genetic architecture using three statistical models. In total, 729 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified, many of which were identified in all three models, including 22 major QTLs that each can explain more than 10% of phenotypic variation. To provide candidate genes for these QTLs, we identified 30 maize genes that are orthologs of 18 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes reported to affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> seed size or weight. Interestingly, 24 of these 30 genes are located in the identified QTLs or within 1 Mb of the significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We further confirmed the effects of five genes on maize kernel size/weight in an independent association mapping panel with 540 lines by candidate gene association analysis. Lastly, the function of <i>ZmINCW1</i>, a homolog of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <i>GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING1</i> that affects seed size and weight, was characterized in detail. <i>ZmINCW1</i> is close to QTL peaks for kernel size/weight (less than 1 Mb) and contains significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting kernel size/weight in the association panel. Overexpression of this gene can rescue the reduced weight of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homozygous mutant line in the <i>AtcwINV2</i> gene (Arabidopsis ortholog of <i>ZmINCW1</i>). These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms affecting seed development are conserved in maize, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, and possibly Arabidopsis.</p>

In Vitro Characterization of Thermostable CAM Rubisco Activase Reveals a Rubisco Interacting Surface Loop
<p>To maintain metabolic flux through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle in higher plants, dead-end inhibited complexes of Rubisco must constantly be engaged and remodeled by the molecular chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca). In C3 plants, the thermolability of Rca is responsible for the deactivation of Rubisco and reduction of photosynthesis at moderately elevated temperatures. We reasoned that crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants must possess thermostable Rca to support Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle flux during the day when stomata are closed. A comparative biochemical characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and <i>Agave tequilana</i> Rca isoforms demonstrated that the CAM Rca isoforms are approximately10°C more thermostable than the C3 isoforms. Agave Rca also possessed a much higher in vitro biochemical activity, even at low assay temperatures. Mixtures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> and agave Rca form functional hetero-oligomers in vitro, but only the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> isoforms denature at nonpermissive temperatures. The high thermostability and activity of agave Rca mapped to the N-terminal 244 residues. A Glu-217-Gln amino acid substitution was found to confer high Rca activity to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> Rca. Further mutational analysis suggested that Glu-217 restricts the flexibility of the α4-β4 surface loop that interacts with Rubisco via Lys-216. CAM plants thus promise to be a source of highly functional, thermostable Rca candidates for thermal fortification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> photosynthesis. Careful characterization of their properties will likely reveal further protein-protein interaction motifs to enrich our mechanistic model of Rca function.</p>

A Salivary Endo-β-1,4-Glucanase Acts as an Effector That Enables the Brown Planthopper to Feed on Rice
<p>The brown planthopper (BPH) <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> is one of the most destructive insect pests on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in Asia. After landing on plants, BPH rapidly accesses plant phloem and sucks the phloem sap through unknown mechanisms. We discovered a salivary endo-β-1,4-glucanase (NlEG1) that has endoglucanase activity with a maximal activity at pH 6 at 37°C and is secreted into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants by BPH. <i>NlEG1</i> is highly expressed in the salivary glands and midgut. Silencing <i>NlEG1</i> decreases the capacity of BPH to reach the phloem and reduces its food intake, mass, survival, and fecundity on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> plants. By contrast, <i>NlEG1</i> silencing had only a small effect on the survival rate of BPH raised on artificial diet. Moreover, NlEG1 secreted by BPH did not elicit the production of the defense-related signal molecules salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, although wounding plus the application of the recombination protein NlEG1 did slightly enhance the levels of jasmonic acid and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in plants compared with the corresponding controls. These data suggest that NlEG1 enables the BPH’s stylet to reach the phloem by degrading celluloses in plant cell walls, thereby functioning as an effector that overcomes the plant cell wall defense in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>.</p>

Two Different Transcripts of a LAMMER Kinase Gene Play Opposite Roles in Disease Resistance
<p>Alternative splicing of genes can increase protein diversity and affect mRNA stability. Genome-wide transcriptome sequencing has demonstrated that alternative splicing occurs in a large number of intron-containing genes of different species. However, despite the phenomenon having been known for decades, it is largely unknown how the alternatively spliced transcripts function differently. Here, we report that two alternatively spliced transcripts of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) LAMMER kinase gene <i>OsDR11</i>, long <i>OsDR11L</i> and short <i>OsDR11S</i>, play opposite roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> resistance against <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>), which causes the most damaging bacterial disease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> worldwide. Overexpressing <i>OsDR11S</i> or suppressing <i>OsDR11L</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> enhanced resistance to <i>Xoo</i>, which was accompanied by an accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes. In contrast, suppressing <i>OsDR11S</i> was associated with increased susceptibility to <i>Xoo</i>, along with decreased levels of JA and expression of JA signaling genes. The OsDR11S and OsDR11L proteins colocalized in the nucleus. OsDR11L showed autophosphorylation activity in vitro, while OsDR11S did not. In the presence of OsDR11S, autophosphorylation of OsDR11L was inhibited, and overexpression of <i>OsDR11S</i> suppressed <i>OsDR11L</i> expression. <i>OsDR11</i> appeared to contribute to a minor quantitative trait locus against <i>Xoo</i>. These results suggest that OsDR11L is a negative regulator in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> disease resistance, which may be associated with suppression of JA signaling. The results also suggest that OsDR11S may inhibit the function of OsDR11L at both the transcription and protein kinase activity levels, leading to resistance against <i>Xoo</i>.</p>

Increase in crop losses to insect pests in a warming climate
<p>Insect pests substantially reduce yields of three staple grains—<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, maize, and wheat—but models assessing the agricultural impacts of global warming rarely consider <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> losses to insects. We use established relationships between temperature and the population growth and metabolic rates of insects to estimate how and where climate warming will augment losses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>, maize, and wheat to insects. Global yield losses of these grains are projected to increase by 10 to 25% per degree of global mean surface warming. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> losses will be most acute in areas where warming increases both population growth and metabolic rates of insects. These conditions are centered primarily in temperate regions, where most grain is produced.</p>

Wheat—the cereal abandoned by GM
<p>The sudden appearance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> diseases can cause an irreparable economic shock, particularly to smallholder farmers in developing countries. Wheat blast, for example, is a devastating fungal disease from South America, which emerged in Bangladesh in 2016 (<i>1</i>). It is currently controlled by quarantine but could easily spread to other wheat-growing areas, which could threaten food security. Furthermore, widespread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> failure from stem rust has occurred in Kenya and Ethiopia. Recent advances could provide a solution to this problem through the rapid discovery and isolation of disease-resistance genes from wild relatives of wheat, followed by their introduction by transformation into the elite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> varieties. There is, however, a barrier to such progress: Wheat, a worldwide staple food, has become an orphan among genetically modified (GM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s.</p>

Improving photosynthesis and crop productivity by accelerating recovery from photoprotection
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> leaves in full sunlight dissipate damaging excess absorbed light energy as heat. When sunlit leaves are shaded by clouds or other leaves, this protective dissipation continues for many minutes and reduces photosynthesis. Calculations have shown that this could cost field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s up to 20% of their potential yield. Here, we describe the bioengineering of an accelerated response to natural shading events in <i>Nicotiana</i> (tobacco), resulting in increased leaf carbon dioxide uptake and plant dry matter productivity by about 15% in fluctuating light. Because the photoprotective mechanism that has been altered is common to all flowering plants and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s, the findings provide proof of concept for a route to obtaining a sustainable increase in productivity for food <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s and a much-needed yield jump.</p>

RSL Class II Transcription Factors Guide the Nuclear Localization of RHL1 to Regulate Root Hair Development
<p>Root hairs are important for absorption of nutrients and water from the rhizosphere. The Root Hair Defective-Six Like (RSL) Class II family of transcription factors is expressed preferentially in root hairs and has a conserved role in root hair development in land plants. We functionally characterized the seven members of the RSL Class II subfamily in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genome. In root hairs, six of these genes were preferentially expressed and four were strongly expressed. Phenotypic analysis of each mutant revealed that <i>Os07g39940</i> plays a major role in root hair formation, based on observations of a short root hair phenotype in those mutants. Overexpression (OX) for each of four family members in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> resulted in an increase in the density and length of root hairs. These four members contain a transcription activation domain and are targeted to the nucleus. They interact with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> Root Hairless1 (OsRHL1), a key regulator of root hair development. When heterologously expressed in epidermal cells of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves, OsRHL1 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. When coexpressed with each of the four RSL Class II members, however, OsRLH1 was translocated to the nucleus. Transcriptome analysis using <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants revealed that 86 genes, including Class III peroxidases, were highly up-regulated. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species levels in the root hairs were increased in <i>Os07g39940-</i>OX plants but were drastically reduced in the <i>os07g39940</i> and <i>rhl1</i> mutants. Our results demonstrate that RSL Class II members function as essential regulators of root hair development in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>.</p>

Characterization of Imprinted Genes in Rice Reveals Conservation of Regulation and Imprinting with Other Plant Species
<p>Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon by which certain genes display differential expression in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner. Hundreds of imprinted genes have been identified from several plant species. Here, we identified, with a high level of confidence, 208 imprinted gene candidates from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Imprinted genes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> showed limited association with the transposable elements, which contrasts with findings from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Generally, imprinting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> is conserved within a species, but intraspecific variation also was detected. The imprinted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> genes do not show signatures of selection, which suggests that domestication has had a limited evolutionary consequence on genomic imprinting. Although conservation of imprinting in plants is limited, we show that some loci are imprinted in several different species. Moreover, our results suggest that different types of epigenetic regulation can be established either before or after fertilization. Imprinted 24-nucleotide small RNAs and their neighboring genes tend to express alleles from different parents. This association was not observed between 21-nucleotide small RNAs and their neighboring genes. Together, our findings suggest that the regulation of imprinting can be diverse, and genomic imprinting has evolutionary and biological significance.</p>

DDM1 Represses Noncoding RNA Expression and RNA-Directed DNA Methylation in Heterochromatin
<p>C methylation of DNA, which occurs at CG, CHG, and CHH (H = A, C, or T) sequences in plants, is a hallmark for the epigenetic repression of repetitive sequences. The chromatin-remodeling factor DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION1 (DDM1) is essential for DNA methylation, especially at CG and CHG sequences. However, its potential roles in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and in chromatin function are not completely understood in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). In this work, we used high-throughput approaches to study the function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> DDM1 (OsDDM1) in RdDM and the expression of noncoding RNA. We show that loss of function of OsDDM1 results in ectopic CHH methylation of transposable elements and repeats. The ectopic CHH methylation was dependent on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE2, a DNA methyltransferase involved in RdDM. Mutations in <i>OsDDM1</i> lead to decreases of histone H3K9me2 and increases in the levels of heterochromatic small RNA and long noncoding RNA. In particular, OsDDM1 was found to be essential to repress the transcription of the two repetitive sequences, Centromeric Retrotransposons of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>1 and the dominant centromeric CentO repeats. These results suggest that OsDDM1 antagonizes RdDM at heterochromatin and represses the tissue-specific expression of noncoding RNA from repetitive sequences in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> genome.</p>

FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 Connects Phospholipid Metabolism and Amyloplast Development in Rice
<p>Starch synthesized and stored in amyloplasts serves as the major energy storage molecule in cereal endosperm. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying amyloplast development and starch synthesis, we isolated a series of floury endosperm mutants in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> mutant <i>floury shrunken endosperm1</i> (<i>fse1</i>), which exhibited obvious defects in the development of compound starch grains, decreased starch content, and altered starch physicochemical features. Map-based cloning showed that <i>FSE1</i> encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A<sub>1</sub>. <i>FSE1</i> was expressed ubiquitously with abundant levels observed in developing seeds and roots. FSE1 was localized to both the cytosol and intracellular membranes. Lipid profiling indicated that total extra-plastidic lipids and phosphatidic acid were increased in <i>fse1</i> plants, suggesting that FSE1 may exhibit in vivo phospholipase A<sub>1</sub> activity on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidyl-Ser, phosphatidylethanolamine, and, in particular, phosphatidic acid. Additionally, the total galactolipid content in developing <i>fse1</i> endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast development. Our results identify FSE1 as a phospholipase-like protein that controls the synthesis of galactolipids in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> endosperm and provide a novel connection between lipid metabolism and starch synthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> grains during endosperm development.</p>

The Kinase OsCPK4 Regulates a Buffering Mechanism That Fine-Tunes Innate Immunity
<p>The calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 has been demonstrated to play important roles in salt and drought tolerance, plant growth, and development in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying OsCPK4 function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> immunity. In this study, we demonstrated that the generation of oxidative burst and pathogenesis-related gene expression triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns were significantly enhanced in the <i>oscpk4</i> mutants. These mutant lines are more resistant to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases than the wild-type plants, indicating that OsCPK4 negatively regulates innate immunity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>. OsCPK4 was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176. OsRLCK176 accumulation is negatively regulated by OsCPK4. Interestingly, the kinase-dead OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation more strongly than the wild-type protein. OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 mutually phosphorylate each other and form a feedback loop. Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 contribute to the stability of OsRLCK176. These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation and restricts plant defenses, whereas the activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 degradation machinery, thus enhancing plant immunity. Collectively, the study proposes a novel defense buffering mechanism mediated by OsCPK4, which fine-tunes microbe-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>.</p>

Transcription Factor OsWRKY53 Positively Regulates Brassinosteroid Signaling and Plant Architecture
<p>Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a class of steroid hormones regulating multiple aspects of plant growth, development, and adaptation. Compared with extensive studies in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the mechanism of BR signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is less understood. Here, we identified OsWRKY53, a transcription factor involved in defense responses, as an important regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> BR signaling. Phenotypic analyses showed that <i>OsWRKY53</i> overexpression led to enlarged leaf angles and increased grain size, in contrast to the erect leaves and smaller seeds in <i>oswrky53</i> mutant. In addition, the <i>oswrky53</i> exhibited decreased BR sensitivity, whereas <i>OsWRKY53</i> overexpression plants were hypersensitive to BR, suggesting that OsWRKY53 positively regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> BR signaling. Moreover, we show that OsWRKY53 can interact with and be phosphorylated by the OsMAPKK4-OsMAPK6 cascade, and the phosphorylation is required for the biological function of OsWRKY53 in regulating BR responses. Furthermore, we found that BR promotes OsWRKY53 protein accumulation but represses <i>OsWRKY53</i> transcript level. Taken together, this study revealed the novel role of OsWRKY53 as a regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> BR signaling and also suggested a potential role of OsWRKY53 in mediating the cross talk between the hormone and other signaling pathways.</p>

Two Trichome Birefringence-Like Proteins Mediate Xylan Acetylation, Which Is Essential for Leaf Blight Resistance in Rice
<p>Acetylation is a ubiquitous modification on cell wall polymers, which play a structural role in plant growth and stress defenses. However, the mechanisms for how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> plants accomplish cell wall polymer <i>O</i>-acetylation are largely unknown. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of two <i>trichome birefringence-like</i> (<i>tbl</i>) mutants in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), which are affected in xylan <i>O</i>-acetylation. <i>ostbl1</i> and <i>ostbl2</i> single mutant and the <i>tbl1 tbl2</i> double mutant displayed a stunted growth phenotype with varied degree of dwarfism. As shown by chemical assays, the wall acetylation level is affected in the mutants and the knock-down and overexpression transgenic plants. Furthermore, NMR spectroscopy analyses showed that all those mutants have varied decreases in xylan monoacetylation. The divergent expression levels of <i>OsTBL1</i> and <i>OsTBL2</i> explained the chemotype difference and indicated that <i>OsTBL1</i> is a functionally dominant gene. OsTBL1 was found to be Golgi-localized. The recombinant OsTBL1 protein incorporates acetyl groups onto xylan. By using xylopentaose, a preferred acceptor substrate, OsTBL1 can transfer up to four acetyl residues onto xylopentaose, and this activity showed saturable kinetics. 2D-NMR spectroscopy showed that OsTBL1 transfers acetate to both 2-<i>O</i> and 3-<i>O</i> sites of xylosyl residues. In addition, <i>ostbl1</i> and <i>tbl1 tbl2</i> displayed susceptibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> blight disease, indicating that this xylan modification is required for pathogen resistance.

The pulse amplitude modulated chlorophyll fluorescence technique (PAM) allows quantitative leaf level monitoring of the utilization of energy for photochemical light conversion and photoprotection in natural environments, potentially over the entire <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> lifecycle. Here, the diurnal relationship between electron transport rate (ETR) and irradiance was measured in five cultivars of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in canopy conditions with PAM fluorescence under natural solar radiation. This relationship differed substantially from that observed for conventional short term light response curves measured under controlled actinic light with the same leaves. This difference was characterized by a reduced curvature factor when curve fitting was used to model this diurnal response. The engagement of photoprotective processes in chloroplast electron transport in leaves under canopy solar radiation was shown to be a major contributor to this difference. Genotypic variation in the irradiance at which energy flux into photoprotective dissipation became greater than ETR was observed. Cultivars capable of higher ETR at midrange light intensities were shown to produce greater leaf area over time, estimated by noninvasive imaging.</p>

Reproductive Long Intergenic Noncoding RNAs Exhibit Male Gamete Specificity and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2-Mediated Repression
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been characterized extensively in animals and are involved in several processes, including homeobox gene expression and X-chromosome inactivation. In comparison, there has been much less detailed characterization of plant lncRNAs, and the number of distinct lncRNAs encoded in plant genomes and their regulation by developmental and epigenetic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we analyzed transcriptome data from Asian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and identified 6,309 long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), focusing on their expression in reproductive tissues and organs. Most <i>O. sativa</i> lincRNAs were expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner, with an unexpectedly high fraction specifically expressed in male gametes. Mutation of a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex2 (PRC2) resulted in derepression of another large class of lincRNAs, whose expression is correlated with H3K27 trimethylation in developing panicles. Overlap with the sperm cell-specific lincRNAs suggests that epigenetic repression of lincRNAs in the panicles was partially relieved in the male germline. Expression of a subset of lincRNAs also showed modulation by drought in reproductive tissues. Comparison with other cereal genomes showed that the lincRNAs generally have low levels of conservation at both the sequence and structural levels. Use of a novelty detection support vector machine model enabled the detection of nucleotide sequence and structural homology in ∼10% and ∼4% of the lincRNAs in genomes of purple false brome (<i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), respectively. This is the first study to report on a large number of lncRNAs that are targets of repression by PRC2 rather than mediating regulation via PRC2. That the vast majority of the lincRNAs reported here do not overlap with those of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> studies indicates that these are a significant addition to the known lincRNAs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong>.</p>

Identification of Functional Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Affecting Leaf Hair Number in <i>Brassica rapa</i>

However, which SNPs are functional for leaf hair traits and, therefore, effective for breeding purposes remains unknown. Here, we identify a set of SNPs in the <i>B. rapa</i> ssp. <i>pekinenesis</i> candidate gene <i>BrpHAIRY LEAVES1</i> (<i>BrpHL1</i>) and a number of SNPs of <i>BrpHL1</i> in a natural population of 210 <i>B. rapa</i> accessions that have hairy, margin-only hairy, and hairless leaves. <i>BrpHL1</i> genes and their orthologs and paralogs have many SNPs. By intensive mutagenesis and genetic transformation, we selected the functional SNPs for leaf hairs by the exclusion of nonfunctional SNPs and the orthologous and paralogous genes. The residue tryptophan-92 of BrpHL1a was essential for direct interaction with GLABROUS3 and, thus, necessary for the formation of leaf hairs. The accessions with the functional SNP leading to substitution of the tryptophan-92 residue had hairless leaves. The orthologous <i>BrcHL1b</i> from <i>B. rapa</i> ssp. <i>chinensis</i> regulates hair formation on leaf margins rather than leaf surfaces. The selected SNP for the hairy phenotype could be adopted as a molecular marker for insect resistance in <i>Brassica</i> spp. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s. Moreover, the procedures optimized here can be used to explain the molecular mechanisms of natural variation and to facilitate the molecular breeding of many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s.</p>

In this study, we report that OsMADS6 directly targets <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION LIKE 1</i> (<i>OsFDML1</i>), a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> homolog of the <i>SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING3</i>-like gene <i>FACTOR OF DNA METHYLATION 1</i> (<i>FDM1</i>) from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Arabidopsis <i>FDM1</i> is involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation and <i>OsFDML1</i> regulates flower development. The expression of <i>OsFDML1</i> overlaps with that of <i>OsMADS6</i> in the palea primordia and the ovule, and OsMADS6 directly promotes <i>OsFDML1</i> expression through binding to regions containing putative CArG motifs within the <i>OsFDML1</i> promoter during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> spikelet development. Consistent with the phenotypes of <i>osmads6</i> mutants, the <i>osfdml1</i> mutants showed floral defects, including altered palea identity with lemma-like shape containing no marginal region of palea, increased numbers of stigmas and fused carpels, and meristem indeterminacy. Moreover, transgenic plants overexpressing <i>OsFDML1</i> displayed floral defects, such as abnormal paleae. Phylogenetic analysis showed that <i>OsFDML1</i> homologs exist only in terrestrial plants. In addition, protein-protein interaction assays showed that OsFDML1 interacts with its close paralog OsFDML2, similar to the activity of OsFDML1 homologs in Arabidopsis. These results provide insight into how the ancient <i>AGL6</i> gene regulates floral development.</p>

The COMPASS-Like Complex Promotes Flowering and Panicle Branching in Rice
<p>Flowering time (heading date) and panicle branch number are important agronomic traits that determine yield in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The activation of flowering requires histone methylation, but the roles of trimethylation of Lys 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3) in modulating heading date and panicle development are unclear. Here, we showed that the COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle branching. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) WD40 protein OsWDR5a interacts with the TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1/SET domain group protein 723 (SDG723) to form the core components of the COMPASS-like complex. Plants in which <i>OsWDR5a</i> or <i>OsTrx1</i> expression was decreased by RNA interference produced fewer secondary branches and less grain and exhibited a delayed heading date under long-day and short-day conditions, whereas loss of <i>OsWDR5a</i> function resulted in embryo lethality. OsWDR5a binds to <i>Early heading date 1</i> to regulate its H3K4me3 and expression levels. Together, our results show that the COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle development and suggest that modulation of H3K4me3 levels by the COMPASS-like complex is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> development.</p>

Trehalose 6-Phosphate Regulates Photosynthesis and Assimilate Partitioning in Reproductive Tissue<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) that expresses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE1</i> (<i>TPP1</i>) from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> <i>MADS6</i> promoter, which is active over the flowering period, produces higher yields than wild type. This yield increase occurs with or without drought conditions during flowering. To understand the mechanistic basis of the increased yield, we characterized gene expression and metabolite profiles in leaves and developing female reproductive tissue, comprising florets, node, pith, and shank, over the flowering period with and without drought. The <i>MADS6</i> promoter was most active in the vasculature, particularly phloem companion cells in florets and pith, consistent with the largest decreases in trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) levels (2- to 3-fold) being found in pith and florets. Low T6P led to decreased gene expression for primary metabolism and increased gene expression for secondary metabolism, particularly lipid-related pathways. Despite similar changes in gene expression, the pith and floret displayed opposing assimilate profiles: sugars, sugar phosphates, amino acids, and lipids increased in florets, but decreased in pith. Possibly explaining this assimilate distribution, seven <i>SWEET</i> genes were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic plants. SnRK1 activity and the expression of the gene for the SnRK1 beta subunit, expression of SnRK1 marker genes, and endogenous trehalose pathway genes were also altered. Furthermore, leaves of the transgenic maize maintained a higher photosynthetic rate for a longer period compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that decreasing T6P in reproductive tissues down-regulates primary metabolism and up-regulates secondary metabolism, resulting in different metabolite profiles in component tissues. Our data implicate T6P/ SnRK1 as a major regulator of whole-plant resource allocation for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> yield improvement.</p>

The OsFBK1 E3 Ligase Subunit Affects Anther and Root Secondary Cell Wall Thickenings by Mediating Turnover of a Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductase
<p>Regulated proteolysis by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system challenges transcription and phosphorylation in magnitude and is one of the most important regulatory mechanisms in plants. This article describes the characterization of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) auxin-responsive Kelch-domain-containing F-box protein, OsFBK1, found to be a component of an SCF E3 ligase by interaction studies in yeast. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> transgenics of <i>OsFBK1</i> displayed variations in anther and root secondary cell wall content; it could be corroborated by electron/confocal microscopy and lignification studies, with no apparent changes in auxin content/signaling pathway. The presence of U-shaped secondary wall thickenings (or lignin) in the anthers were remarkably less pronounced in plants overexpressing <i>OsFBK1</i> as compared to wild-type and knockdown transgenics. The roots of the transgenics also displayed differential accumulation of lignin. Yeast two-hybrid anther library screening identified an OsCCR that is a homolog of the well-studied Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) IRX4; OsFBK1-OsCCR interaction was confirmed by fluorescence and immunoprecipitation studies. Degradation of OsCCR mediated by SCF<sup>OsFBK1</sup> and the 26S proteasome pathway was validated by cell-free experiments in the absence of auxin, indicating that the phenotype observed is due to the direct interaction between OsFBK1 and OsCCR. Interestingly, the <i>OsCCR</i> knockdown transgenics also displayed a decrease in root and anther lignin depositions, suggesting that OsFBK1 plays a role in the development of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> anthers and roots by regulating the cellular levels of a key enzyme controlling lignification.</p>

Gradually Decreasing Starch Branching Enzyme Expression Is Responsible for the Formation of Heterogeneous Starch Granules
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is mainly occupied by homogeneous polygonal starch from inside to outside. However, morphologically different (heterogeneous) starches have been identified in some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> mutants. How these heterogeneous starches form remains unknown. A high-amylose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rice</span></strong> line (TRS) generated through the antisense inhibition of <i>starch branching synthase I</i> (<i>SBEI</i>) and <i>SBEIIb</i> contains four heterogeneous starches: polygonal, aggregate, elongated, and hollow starch; these starches are regionally distributed in the endosperm from inside to outside. Here, we investigated the relationship between SBE dosage and the morphological architecture of heterogeneous starches in TRS endosperm from the view of the molecular structure of starch. The results indicated that their molecular structures underwent regular changes, including gradually increasing true amylose content but decreasing amylopectin content and gradually increasing the ratio of amylopectin long chain but decreasing the ratio of amylopectin short chain. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) amounts in the four heterogeneous starches were not significantly different from each other, but SBEI, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb showed a gradually decreasing trend. Further immunostaining analysis revealed that the gradually decreasing SBEs acting on the formation of the four heterogeneous granules were mainly due to the spatial distribution of the three SBEs in the endosperm. It was suggested that the decreased amylopectin in starch might remove steric hindrance and provide extra space for abundant amylose accumulation when the GBSSI amount was not elevated. Furthermore, extra amylose coupled with altered amylopectin structure possibly led to morphological changes in heterogeneous granules.</p>

A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy
<p>Process-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> growth</span></strong> models are popular tools with which to analyze and understand the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> management, genotype-by-environment interactions, or climate change. The ability to predict leaf area development is critical to predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> growth</span></strong>, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering growth coordination rules between wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant organs (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and sheaths, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to model the dynamics of canopy development. We found a unique relationship between laminae area and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and sheath areas also were found, highlighting the tight control of organ growth within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to develop a simulation model of leaf area dynamics at the canopy level that was integrated in the wheat model SiriusQuality. The model was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The model accurately predicts leaf area dynamics under different scenarios of nitrogen and water limitations. It accounted for 85%, 64%, and 73% of the variability of the surface area of leaf cohorts, total leaf area index, and total green area index, respectively. The process-based model of the dynamics of leaf area described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on wheat growth.</p>

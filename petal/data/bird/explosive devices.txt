Hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic actuators with muscle-like performance
<p>Existing soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">actuat</span></strong>ors have persistent challenges that restrain the potential of soft robotics, highlighting a need for soft transducers that are powerful, high-speed, efficient, and robust. We describe a class of soft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">actuat</span></strong>ors, termed hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic (HASEL) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">actuat</span></strong>ors, which harness a mechanism that couples electrostatic and hydraulic forces to achieve a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">actuat</span></strong>ion modes. We introduce prototypical designs of HASEL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">actuat</span></strong>ors and demonstrate their robust, muscle-like performance as well as their ability to repeatedly self-heal after dielectric breakdown—all using widely available materials and common fabrication techniques. A soft gripper handling delicate objects and a self-sensing artificial muscle powering a robotic arm illustrate the wide potential of HASEL <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">actuat</span></strong>ors for next-generation soft robotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es.</p>

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells
<p>Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es. We report that continuous light illumination leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-efficiency photovoltaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es. Correlated, in situ structural and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e, boosting the power conversion efficiency from 18.5 to 20.5%. The lattice expansion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor. The light-induced lattice expansion did not compromise the stability of these high-efficiency photovoltaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es under continuous operation at full-spectrum 1-sun (100 milliwatts per square centimeter) illumination for more than 1500 hours.</p>

Left Ventricular Assist Device Malfunctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reports of left ventricular assist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e (LVAD) malfunction have focused on pump thrombosis. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e consists of the pump, driveline, and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Prospectively collected data were reviewed for all LVAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e malfunctions (DMs) occurring in rotary LVADs implanted at a single center between April 2004 and May 2016. Durable LVADs included 108 Heartmate II (HM II) and 105 HeartWare VAD (HVAD). DM data were categorized according to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e type and into categories related to the component that failed: (1) controller, (2) peripheral components, and (3) implantable blood pump or its integral electric driveline. Pump-related events were analyzed as pump-specific (suspected or confirmed thrombosis) or nonpump-specific (driveline failure). DM rates were reported as events per 1000 patient-days, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses. Cumulative rates of malfunction were examined for the main components of each type of LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Types of DM included controller failure (30%), battery failure (19%), or patient cable failure (14%), whereas only 13% were because of pump failure. DMs were more common in the HM II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e (3.73 per 1000 patient-days versus 3.06 per 1000 patient-days for the HVAD, <i>P</i><0.01). A higher rate of pump-specific malfunctions was discovered in those implanted with an HM II versus an HVAD (0.55 versus 0.39, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01) and peripheral malfunctions (2.32 versus 1.78 for the HM II and HVAD, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01); no difference occurred in the incidence of controller DM between the 2 LVADs. Patients with HVAD were 90% free of a pump-specific malfunction at 3 years compared with 56% for the HM II (log-rank <i>P</i><0.003). Only 74% of the patients with HM II were free of pump thrombosis at 3 years compared with 90% of the patients with HVAD. Freedom from failure of the integrated driveline was 79% at 3 years for the HM II but 100% for the HVAD (log-rank <i>P</i><0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e malfunction is much broader than pump failure alone and occurs for different components at different rates based on the type of LVAD.</p></sec>

A Eu<sup>3+</sup>-Eu<sup>2+</sup> ion redox shuttle imparts operational durability to Pb-I perovskite solar cells
<p>The components with soft nature in the metal halide perovskite absorber usually generate lead (Pb)<sup>0</sup> and iodine (I)<sup>0</sup> defects during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e fabrication and operation. These defects serve as not only recombination centers to deteriorate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e efficiency but also degradation initiators to hamper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e lifetimes. We show that the europium ion pair Eu<sup>3+</sup>-Eu<sup>2+</sup> acts as the “redox shuttle” that selectively oxidized Pb<sup>0</sup> and reduced I<sup>0</sup> defects simultaneously in a cyclical transition. The resultant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.52% (certified 20.52%) with substantially improved long-term durability. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es retained 92% and 89% of the peak PCE under 1-sun continuous illumination or heating at 85°C for 1500 hours and 91% of the original stable PCE after maximum power point tracking for 500 hours, respectively.</p>

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which electrons in solids crystallize into a periodic pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e-rich and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e-poor sites owing to strong electron correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In geometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy electronic state without long-range CO has been observed. We found that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e-ordered organic material with an isosceles triangular lattice shows <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e dynamics associated with crystallization and vitrification of electrons, which can be understood in the context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO patterns. The dynamics suggest that the same nucleation and growth processes that characterize conventional glass-forming liquids guide the crystallization of electrons. These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of the liquid-glass transition.</p>

Highly efficient electrocaloric cooling with electrostatic actuation
<p>Solid-state refrigeration offers potential advantages over traditional cooling systems, but few <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es offer high specific cooling power with a high coefficient of performance (COP) and the ability to be applied directly to surfaces. We developed a cooling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e with a high intrinsic thermodynamic efficiency using a flexible electrocaloric (EC) polymer film and an electrostatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">actuat</span></strong>ion mechanism. Reversible electrostatic forces reduce parasitic power consumption and allow efficient heat transfer through good thermal contacts with the heat source or heat sink. The EC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e produced a specific cooling power of 2.8 watts per gram and a COP of 13. The new cooling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e is more efficient and compact than existing surface-conformable solid-state cooling technologies, opening a path to using the technology for a variety of practical applications.</p>

Derivation and Validation of a Novel Right-Sided Heart Failure Model After Implantation of Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The aim of the study was to derive and validate a novel risk score for early right-sided heart failure (RHF) after left ventricular assist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The EUROMACS (European Registry for Patients with Mechanical Circulatory Support) was used to identify adult patients undergoing continuous-flow left ventricular assist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e implantation with mainstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es. Eligible patients (n=2988) were randomly divided into derivation (n=2000) and validation (n=988) cohorts. The primary outcome was early (<30 days) severe postoperative RHF, defined as receiving short- or long-term right-sided circulatory support, continuous inotropic support for ≥14 days, or nitric oxide ventilation for ≥48 hours. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit. Covariates found to be associated with RHF (exploratory univariate <i>P</i><0.10) were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model. A risk score was then generated using the relative magnitude of the exponential regression model coefficients of independent predictors at the last step after checking for collinearity, likelihood ratio test, c index, and clinical weight at each step.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A 9.5-point risk score incorporating 5 variables (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support class, use of multiple inotropes, severe right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography, ratio of right atrial/pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, hemoglobin) was created. The mean scores in the derivation and validation cohorts were 2.7±1.9 and 2.6±2.0, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.32). RHF in the derivation cohort occurred in 433 patients (21.7%) after left ventricular assist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e implantation and was associated with a lower 1-year (53% versus 71%; <i>P</i><0.001) and 2-year (45% versus 58%; <i>P</i><0.001) survival compared with patients without RHF. RHF risk ranged from 11% (low risk score 0–2) to 43.1% (high risk score >4; <i>P</i><0.0001). Median intensive care unit stay was 7 days (interquartile range, 4–15 days) versus 24 days (interquartile range, 14–38 days) in patients without versus with RHF, respectively (<i>P</i><0.001). The c index of the composite score was 0.70 in the derivation and 0.67 in the validation cohort. The EUROMACS-RHF risk score outperformed (<i>P</i><0.0001) previously published scores and known individual echocardiographic and hemodynamic markers of RHF.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This novel EUROMACS-RHF risk score outperformed currently known risk scores and clinical predictors of early postoperative RHF.

Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital deaths and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of death and CVE rates was performed for ablation, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e implantation, electrophysiology study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE rates in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively. Patients undergoing lead extraction had the highest overall mortality rate at 1.9% (95% CI, 1.34–2.61) and CVE rate at 0.62% (95% CI, 0.32–1.07).

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p>Lipid A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. Lipid A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the phosphates of lipid A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different lipid A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the lipid A phosphates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory protein PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional phosphate group to lipid A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modification of the lipid A phosphates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e more than does pEtN, modification of lipid A phosphates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in lipid A negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e. Our findings demonstrate how bacteria tailor their cell surface to different stresses, such as those faced inside phagocytes.</p>

Spin transport in a Mott insulator of ultracold fermions
<p>Strongly correlated materials are expected to feature unconventional transport properties, such that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e, spin, and heat conduction are potentially independent probes of the dynamics. In contrast to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transport, the measurement of spin transport in such materials is highly challenging. We observed spin conduction and diffusion in a system of ultracold fermionic atoms that realizes the half-filled Fermi-Hubbard model. For strong interactions, spin diffusion is driven by super-exchange and doublon-hole–assisted tunneling, and strongly violates the quantum limit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e diffusion. The technique developed in this work can be extended to finite doping, which can shed light on the complex interplay between spin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e in the Hubbard model.</p>

Counter-propagating charge transport in the quantum Hall effect regime

Although this picture remains valid for electrons and Laughlin’s fractional quasiparticles, it no longer holds for quasiparticles in the so-called hole-conjugate states.

Twistable electronics with dynamically rotatable heterostructures
<p>In heterostructures of two-dimensional materials, electronic properties can vary dramatically with relative interlayer angle. This effect makes it theoretically possible to realize a new class of twistable electronics in which properties can be manipulated on demand by means of rotation. We demonstrate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e architecture in which a layered heterostructure can be dynamically twisted in situ. We study graphene encapsulated by boron nitride, where, at small rotation angles, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e characteristics are dominated by coupling to a long-wavelength moirééé superlattice.

The [4Fe4S] cluster of human DNA primase functions as a redox switch using DNA charge transport
<p>DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transport chemistry offers a means of long-range, rapid redox signaling. We demonstrate that the [4Fe4S] cluster in human DNA primase can make use of this chemistry to coordinate the first steps of DNA synthesis. Using DNA electrochemistry, we found that a change in oxidation state of the [4Fe4S] cluster acts as a switch for DNA binding. Single-atom mutations that inhibit this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transfer hinder primase initiation without affecting primase structure or polymerization. Generating a single base mismatch in the growing primer duplex, which attenuates DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transport, inhibits primer truncation. Thus, redox signaling by [4Fe4S] clusters using DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transport regulates primase binding to DNA and illustrates chemistry that may efficiently drive substrate handoff between polymerases during DNA replication.</p>

We use semiconductor quantum dots to deterministically generate long strings of polarization-entangled photons in a cluster state by periodic timed excitation of a precessing matter qubit. In each period, an entangled photon is added to the cluster state formed by the matter qubit and the previously emitted photons. In our prototype <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e, the qubit is the confined dark exciton, and it produces strings of hundreds of photons in which the entanglement persists over five sequential photons.

Genome- and Phenome-Wide Analyses of Cardiac Conduction Identifies Markers of Arrhythmia Risk
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>ECG QRS duration, a measure of cardiac intraventricular conduction, varies ≈2-fold in individuals without cardiac disease. Slow conduction may promote re-entrant arrhythmias.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genomic markers of QRS duration in 5272 individuals without cardiac disease selected from electronic medical record algorithms at 5 sites in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. The most significant loci were evaluated within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium QRS genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Twenty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 loci, previously described by CHARGE, were replicated in the eMERGE samples; 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were in the chromosome 3 <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>SCN10A</i> loci, where the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were rs1805126 in <i>SCN5A</i> with <i>P</i>=1.2×10<sup>−8</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=2.5×10<sup>−20</sup> (CHARGE) and rs6795970 in <i>SCN10A</i> with <i>P</i>=6×10<sup>−6</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=5×10<sup>−27</sup> (CHARGE). The other loci were in <i>NFIA</i>, near <i>CDKN1A</i>, and near <i>C6orf204.</i> We then performed phenome-wide association studies on variants in these 5 loci in 13859 European Americans to search for diagnoses associated with these markers. Phenome-wide association study identified atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias as the most common associated diagnoses with <i>SCN10A</i> and <i>SCN5A</i> variants. <i>SCN10A</i> variants were also associated with subsequent development of atrial fibrillation and arrhythmia in the original 5272 “heart-healthy” study population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>We conclude that DNA biobanks coupled to electronic medical records not only provide a platform for genome-wide association study but also may allow broad interrogation of the longitudinal incidence of disease associated with genetic variants.

Quantum-critical conductivity of the Dirac fluid in graphene
<p>Graphene near <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e neutrality is expected to behave like a quantum-critical, relativistic plasma—the “Dirac fluid”—in which massless electrons and holes collide at a rapid rate. We used on-chip terahertz spectroscopy to measure the frequency-dependent optical conductivity of clean, micrometer-scale graphene at electron temperatures between 77 and 300 kelvin. At <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e neutrality, we observed the quantum-critical scattering rate characteristic of the Dirac fluid. At higher doping, we detected two distinct current-carrying modes with zero and nonzero total momenta, a manifestation of relativistic hydrodynamics. Our work reveals the quantum criticality and unusual dynamic excitations near <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e neutrality in graphene.</p>

A Josephson relation for fractionally charged anyons
<p>Anyons occur in two-dimensional electron systems as excitations with fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e in the topologically ordered states of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Their dynamics are of utmost importance for topological quantum phases and possible decoherence-free quantum information approaches, but observing these dynamics experimentally is challenging. Here, we report on a dynamical property of anyons: the long-predicted Josephson relation <i>f</i><sub>J </sub>= <i>e</i>*<i>V</i>/<i>h</i> for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>es <i>e</i>* = <i>e</i>/3 and <i>e</i>/5, where <i>e</i> is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e of the electron and <i>h</i> is Planck’s constant. The relation manifests itself as marked signatures in the dependence of photo-assisted shot noise (PASN) on voltage <i>V</i> when irradiating contacts at microwaves frequency <i>f</i><sub>J</sub>. The validation of FQHE PASN models indicates a path toward realizing time-resolved anyon sources based on levitons.</p>

A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory
<p>Single-photon switches and transistors generate strong photon-photon interactions that are essential for quantum circuits and networks. However, the deterministic control of an optical signal with a single photon requires strong interactions with a quantum memory, which has been challenging to achieve in a solid-state platform. We demonstrate a single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e consists of a semiconductor spin qubit strongly coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. The spin qubit enables a single 63-picosecond gate photon to switch a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 photons before the internal state of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e resets. Our results show that semiconductor nanophotonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es can produce strong and controlled photon-photon interactions that could enable high-bandwidth photonic quantum information processing.</p>

Nanofluidic rocking Brownian motors
<p>Control and transport of nanoscale objects in fluids is challenging because of the unfavorable scaling of most interaction mechanisms to small length scales. We designed energy landscapes for nanoparticles by accurately shaping the geometry of a nanofluidic slit and exploiting the electrostatic interaction between like-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>ed particles and walls. Directed transport was performed by combining asymmetric potentials with an oscillating electric field to achieve a rocking Brownian motor. Using gold spheres 60 nanometers in diameter, we investigated the physics of the motor with high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling a parameter-free comparison with theory. We fabricated a sorting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e that separates 60- and 100-nanometer particles in opposing directions within seconds. Modeling suggests that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e separates particles with a radial difference of 1 nanometer.</p>

A nonconjugated radical polymer glass with high electrical conductivity
<p>Solid-state conducting polymers usually have highly conjugated macromolecular backbones and require intentional doping in order to achieve high electrical conductivities. Conversely, single-component, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e-neutral macromolecules could be synthetically simpler and have improved processibility and ambient stability. We show that poly(4-glycidyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl), a nonconjugated radical polymer with a subambient glass transition temperature, underwent rapid solid-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transfer reactions and had an electrical conductivity of up to 28 siemens per meter over channel lengths up to 0.6 micrometers. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transport through the radical polymer film was enabled with thermal annealing at 80°C, which allowed for the formation of a percolating network of open-shell sites in electronic communication with one another. The electrical conductivity was not enhanced by intentional doping, and thin films of this material showed high optical transparency.</p>

Digitization of multistep organic synthesis in reactionware for on-demand pharmaceuticals

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e was designed and constructed by using a chemical to computer-automated design (ChemCAD) approach that enables the translation of traditional bench-scale synthesis into a platform-independent digital code. This in turn guides production of a three-dimensional printed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e that encloses the entire synthetic route internally via simple operations. We demonstrate the approach for the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist, (±)-baclofen, establishing a concept that paves the way for the local manufacture of drugs outside of specialist facilities.</p>

Extremely efficient internal exciton dissociation through edge states in layered 2D perovskites
<p>Understanding and controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e and energy flow in state-of-the-art semiconductor quantum wells has enabled high-efficiency optoelectronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es. Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites are solution-processed quantum wells wherein the band gap can be tuned by varying the perovskite-layer thickness, which modulates the effective electron-hole confinement. We report that, counterintuitive to classical quantum-confined systems where photogenerated electrons and holes are strongly bound by Coulomb interactions or excitons, the photophysics of thin films made of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a thickness exceeding two perovskite-crystal units (>1.3 nanometers) is dominated by lower-energy states associated with the local intrinsic electronic structure of the edges of the perovskite layers. These states provide a direct pathway for dissociating excitons into longer-lived free carriers that substantially improve the performance of optoelectronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es.</p>

Percutaneous Therapies for Peripheral Artery Disease
<p>Percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery disease continue to evolve with new techniques and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es. Although guidelines-recommended therapies have impacted cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, endovascular interventions have been shown to reduce limb pain, improve quality of life, and prolong walking distance for those with claudication and to reduce amputation rates among those with critical limb ischemia. Novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es such as drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons have improved patency for moderate-length lesions, whereas others allow treatment of heavily calcified and tortuous segments. New adjunctive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es to cross lesions and reduce or modify associated plaque have also been developed, although level 1 data regarding their efficacy are sparse. There has also been a better mechanistic understanding of lower extremity endovascular treatment using tools such as intravascular ultrasound. This information has highlighted the need for better stent size selection for the femoropopliteal arterial segments and larger balloon diameters for the tibial arteries. Moreover, a wound perfusion approach with direct in-line flow, the so-called angiosome approach, and reconstruction of the pedal loop have been advocated for improved wound healing. Technical advances such as the tibiopedal access and reentry methods have allowed crossing of lesions that were considered no option for the endovascular approach in the past. Collectively, there has been increased awareness, interest, and commitment by various specialty societies and organizations to advance the treatment of peripheral artery disease and critical limb ischemia. This is also evident by the recent coalition of 7 professional societies and organizations that represented >150 000 allied health professionals and millions of patients with peripheral artery disease at the 2015 Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Analysis Committee meeting. The percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery disease continue to evolve with longer follow-up with randomized data and larger prospective registries. In the future, it is hopeful that we will treat the lower extremity arteries according to segments, taking into account plaque morphology, luminal versus subintimal crossing, location, and stenotic versus occlusive disease. Until then, we must identify the most cost-effective, efficacious, and safe treatment for each patient. The goal of this article is to aid the practicing vascular specialist consider the optimal choices for the management of patients with vascular disease.</p>

Electronic crystal growth

We photopattern up to centimeter-sized gels containing multiple domains that undergo different shape changes in response to different DNA sequences.

Optical imaging of surface chemistry and dynamics in confinement

Spatially resolved surface acid dissociation constant (p<i>K</i><sub>a,s</sub>) values were determined for the silica deprotonation reaction by following pH-induced chemical changes on the curved and confined surfaces of a glass microcapillary immersed in aqueous solutions. These values ranged from 2.3 to 10.7 along the wall of a single capillary because of surface heterogeneities. Water molecules that rotate along an oscillating external electric field were also imaged.</p>

A molecular spin-photovoltaic device
<p>We fabricated a C<sub>60</sub> fullerene–based molecular spin-photovoltaic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e that integrates a photovoltaic response with the spin transport across the molecular layer. The photovoltaic response can be modified under the application of a small magnetic field, with a magnetophotovoltage of up to 5% at room temperature. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e functionalities include a magnetic current inverter and the presence of diverging magnetocurrent at certain illumination levels that could be useful for sensing. Completely spin-polarized currents can be created by balancing the external partially spin-polarized injection with the photogenerated carriers.</p>

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators
<p>Topological phases, like the Haldane phase in spin-1 chains, defy characterization through local order parameters. Instead, nonlocal string order parameters can be employed to reveal their hidden order. Similar diluted magnetic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e separation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden magnetic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of nonlocal spin-density correlation functions reveals a hidden finite-range antiferromagnetic order, a direct consequence of spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e separation. Our technique, which measures nonlocal order directly, can be readily extended to higher dimensions to study the complex interplay between magnetic order and density fluctuations.</p>

Highly elastic binders integrating polyrotaxanes for silicon microparticle anodes in lithium ion batteries
<p>Lithium-ion batteries with ever-increasing energy densities are needed for batteries for advanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es and all-electric vehicles. Silicon has been highlighted as a promising anode material because of its superior specific capacity. During repeated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e-dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e cycles, silicon undergoes huge volume changes. This limits cycle life via particle pulverization and an unstable electrode-electrolyte interface, especially when the particle sizes are in the micrometer range. We show that the incorporation of 5 weight % polyrotaxane to conventional polyacrylic acid binder imparts extraordinary elasticity to the polymer network originating from the ring sliding motion of polyrotaxane. This binder combination keeps even pulverized silicon particles coalesced without disintegration, enabling stable cycle life for silicon microparticle anodes at commercial-level areal capacities.</p>

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices
<p>Cyclotron motion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e carriers in metals and semiconductors leads to Landau quantization and magneto-oscillatory behavior in their properties. Cryogenic temperatures are usually required to observe these oscillations. We show that graphene superlattices support a different type of quantum oscillation that does not rely on Landau quantization. The oscillations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e carriers experience effectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Our work hints at unexplored physics in Hofstadter butterfly systems at high temperatures.</p>

Carbon nanotube transistors scaled to a 40-nanometer footprint
<p>The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors challenges the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e research community to reduce the transistor footprint containing all components to 40 nanometers within the next decade. We report on a p-channel transistor scaled to such an extremely small dimension. Built on one semiconducting carbon nanotube, it occupies less than half the space of leading silicon technologies, while delivering a significantly higher pitch-normalized current density—above 0.9 milliampere per micrometer at a low supply voltage of 0.5 volts with a subthreshold swing of 85 millivolts per decade. Furthermore, we show transistors with the same small footprint built on actual high-density arrays of such nanotubes that deliver higher current than that of the best-competing silicon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es under the same overdrive, without any normalization. We achieve this using low-resistance end-bonded contacts, a high-purity semiconducting carbon nanotube source, and self-assembly to pack nanotubes into full surface-coverage aligned arrays.</p>

Human-in-the-loop optimization of exoskeleton assistance during walking
<p>Exoskeletons and active prostheses promise to enhance human mobility, but few have succeeded. Optimizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e all contributed to improved economy. Optimization methods with these features can substantially improve performance.</p>

Water harvesting from air with metal-organic frameworks powered by natural sunlight
<p>Atmospheric water is a resource equivalent to ~10% of all fresh water in lakes on Earth. However, an efficient process for capturing and delivering water from air, especially at low humidity levels (down to 20%), has not been developed.

All-printed thin-film transistors from networks of liquid-exfoliated nanosheets
<p>All-printed transistors consisting of interconnected networks of various types of two-dimensional nanosheets are an important goal in nanoscience. Using electrolytic gating, we demonstrate all-printed, vertically stacked transistors with graphene source, drain, and gate electrodes, a transition metal dichalcogenide channel, and a boron nitride (BN) separator, all formed from nanosheet networks. The BN network contains an ionic liquid within its porous interior that allows electrolytic gating in a solid-like structure. Nanosheet network channels display on:off ratios of up to 600, transconductances exceeding 5 millisiemens, and mobilities of >0.1 square centimeters per volt per second. Unusually, the on-currents scaled with network thickness and volumetric capacitance. In contrast to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es with comparable mobility, large capacitances, while hindering switching speeds, allow these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es to carry higher currents at relatively low drive voltages.</p>

How “you” makes meaning
<p>“You” is one of the most common words in the English language. Although it typically refers to the person addressed (“How are you?”), “you” is also used to make timeless statements about people in general (“You win some, you lose some.”). Here, we demonstrate that this ubiquitous but understudied linguistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e, known as “generic-you,” has important implications for how people derive meaning from experience. Across six experiments, we found that generic-you is used to express norms in both ordinary and emotional contexts and that producing generic-you when reflecting on negative experiences allows people to “normalize” their experience by extending it beyond the self. In this way, a simple linguistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>e serves a powerful meaning-making function.</p>

Demonstration of an ac Josephson junction laser
<p>Superconducting electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es have reemerged as contenders for both classical and quantum computing due to their fast operation speeds, low dissipation, and long coherence times. An ultimate demonstration of coherence is lasing. We use one of the fundamental aspects of superconductivity, the ac Josephson effect, to demonstrate a laser made from a Josephson junction strongly coupled to a multimode superconducting cavity. A dc voltage bias applied across the junction provides a source of microwave photons, and the circuit’s nonlinearity allows for efficient down-conversion of higher-order Josephson frequencies to the cavity’s fundamental mode. The simple fabrication and operation allows for easy integration with a range of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es, allowing for efficient on-chip generation of coherent microwave photons at low temperatures.</p>

Anomalously low electronic thermal conductivity in metallic vanadium dioxide
<p>In electrically conductive solids, the Wiedemann-Franz law requires the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity to be proportional to electrical conductivity. Violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law are typically an indication of unconventional quasiparticle dynamics, such as inelastic scattering, or hydrodynamic collective motion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e carriers, typically pronounced only at cryogenic temperatures. We report an order-of-magnitude breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law at high temperatures ranging from 240 to 340 kelvin in metallic vanadium dioxide in the vicinity of its metal-insulator transition. Different from previously established mechanisms, the unusually low electronic thermal conductivity is a signature of the absence of quasiparticles in a strongly correlated electron fluid where heat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e diffuse independently.</p>

Scaling carbon nanotube complementary transistors to 5-nm gate lengths
<p>High-performance top-gated carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) with a gate length of 5 nanometers can be fabricated that perform better than silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) FETs at the same scale. A scaling trend study revealed that the scaled CNT-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es, which use graphene contacts, can operate much faster and at much lower supply voltage (0.4 versus 0.7 volts) and with much smaller subthreshold slope (typically 73 millivolts per decade). The 5-nanometer CNT FETs approached the quantum limit of FETs by using only one electron per switching operation. In addition, the contact length of the CNT CMOS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">devic</span></strong>es was also scaled down to 25 nanometers, and a CMOS inverter with a total pitch size of 240 nanometers was also demonstrated.</p>

Highly stretchable polymer semiconductor films through the nanoconfinement effect
<p>Soft and conformable wearable electronics require stretchable semiconductors, but existing ones typically sacrifice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transport mobility to achieve stretchability. We explore a concept based on the nanoconfinement of polymers to substantially improve the stretchability of polymer semiconductors, without affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transport mobility. The increased polymer chain dynamics under nanoconfinement significantly reduces the modulus of the conjugated polymer and largely delays the onset of crack formation under strain. As a result, our fabricated semiconducting film can be stretched up to 100% strain without affecting mobility, retaining values comparable to that of amorphous silicon. The fully stretchable transistors exhibit high biaxial stretchability with minimal change in on current even when poked with a sharp object. We demonstrate a skinlike finger-wearable driver for a light-emitting diode.</p>

Command of active matter by topological defects and patterns
<p>Self-propelled bacteria are marvels of nature with a potential to power dynamic materials and microsystems of the future. The challenge lies in commanding their chaotic behavior. By dispersing swimming <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> in a liquid crystalline environment with spatially varying orientation of the anisotropy axis, we demonstrate control over the distribution of bacterial concentration, as well as the geometry and polarity of their trajectories. Bacteria recognize subtle differences in liquid crystal deformations, engaging in bipolar swimming in regions of pure splay and bend but switching to unipolar swimming in mixed splay-bend regions. They differentiate topological defects, heading toward defects of positive topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e and avoiding negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>es. Sensitivity of bacteria to preimposed orientational patterns represents a previously unknown facet of the interplay between hydrodynamics and topology of active matter.</p>

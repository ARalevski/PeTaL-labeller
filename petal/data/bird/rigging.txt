MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>s. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ing synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

NDH-PSI Supercomplex Assembly Precedes Full Assembly of the NDH Complex in Chloroplast
<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex is structurally similar to respiratory complex I and mediates PSI cyclic electron flow. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast NDH is composed of at least 29 subunits and associates with two copies of PSI to form the NDH-PSI supercomplex. Here, we found that CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION3 (CRR3) is an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y factor required for the accumulation of subcomplex B (SubB) of chloroplast NDH. In Suc density gradient centrifugation, CRR3 was detected in three protein complexes. Accumulation of the largest peak III complex was impaired in mutants defective in the SubB subunits PnsB2-PnsB5. The oligomeric form of CRR3 likely functions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>e the core of SubB to form the peak III complex as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y intermediate. A defect in the PnsL3 subunit increased the level of the peak III complex, suggesting that CRR3 was released from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y intermediate after PnsL3 binding. Unlike PnsB2-PnsB5 and PnsL3, PnsB1 was not absolutely necessary for stabilizing SubB. PnsB1 is likely incorporated into the intermediate at the final step during SubB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. Lhca6 is a linker protein mediating NDH-PSI supercomplex formation, and its site of contact with NDH was suggested to be SubB. In the <i>lhca6</i> mutant, accumulation of the peak III complex was impaired, suggesting that SubB interacted with Lhca6 during the step of SubB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. The process of supercomplex formation was triggered before the completion of the NDH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. Consistent with its predicted function, CRR3 accumulated in young leaves, where the NDH complex was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed.</p>

De novo assembly of the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> genome using Hi-C yields chromosome-length scaffolds
<p>The Zika outbreak, spread by the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito, highlights the need to create high-quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies of large genomes in a rapid and cost-effective way. Here we combine Hi-C data with existing draft <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies to generate chromosome-length scaffolds.

We then combine our method with draft sequences to create genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies of the mosquito disease vectors <i>Ae</i>.<i> aegypti</i> and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, each consisting of three scaffolds corresponding to the three chromosomes in each species.

Complex signal processing in synthetic gene circuits using cooperative regulatory assemblies
<p>Eukaryotic genes are regulated by multivalent transcription factor complexes. Through cooperative self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, these complexes perform nonlinear regulatory operations involved in cellular decision-making and signal processing. In this study, we apply this design principle to synthetic networks, testing whether engineered cooperative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies can program nonlinear gene circuit behavior in yeast. Using a model-guided approach, we show that specifying the strength and number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y subunits enables predictive tuning between linear and nonlinear regulatory responses for single- and multi-input circuits. We demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies can be adjusted to control circuit dynamics. We harness this capability to engineer circuits that perform dynamic filtering, enabling frequency-dependent decoding in cell populations. Programmable cooperative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y provides a versatile way to tune the nonlinearity of network connections, markedly expanding the engineerable behaviors available to synthetic circuits.</p>

High-resolution comparative analysis of great ape genomes
<p>Genetic studies of human evolution require high-quality contiguous ape genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies that are not guided by the human reference.

By comparing these with two long-read de novo human genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies and a gorilla genome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, we characterized lineage-specific and shared great ape genetic variation ranging from single– to mega–base pair–sized variants. We identified ~17,000 fixed human-specific structural variants identifying genic and putative regulatory changes that have emerged in humans since divergence from nonhuman apes. Interestingly, these variants are enriched near genes that are down-regulated in human compared to chimpanzee cerebral organoids, particularly in cells analogous to radial glial neural progenitors.</p>

Building superlattices from individual nanoparticles via template-confined DNA-mediated assembly

RPA binds histone H3-H4 and functions in DNA replication–coupled nucleosome assembly
<p>DNA replication–coupled nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y is essential to maintain genome integrity and retain epigenetic information. Multiple involved histone chaperones have been identified, but how nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y is coupled to DNA replication remains elusive. Here we show that replication protein A (RPA), an essential replisome component that binds single-stranded DNA, has a role in replication-coupled nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. RPA directly binds free H3-H4. Assays using a synthetic sequence that mimics freshly unwound single-stranded DNA at replication fork showed that RPA promotes DNA-(H3-H4) complex formation immediately adjacent to double-stranded DNA. Further, an RPA mutant defective in H3-H4 binding exhibited attenuated nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y on nascent chromatin. Thus, we propose that RPA functions as a platform for targeting histone deposition to replication fork, through which RPA couples nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y with ongoing DNA replication.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also binds with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> channels already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>es with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, binds to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> channel via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to channel-gating control. Binding to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed channel gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 binding without influencing gating. Channel binding was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this structure when not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed channel binding and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two channel-binding sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that binding begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> channel gating during SNARE <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> channels are nucleation points for SNARE complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y.</p>

Atomic structures of low-complexity protein segments reveal kinked β sheets that assemble networks
<p>Subcellular membraneless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies are a reinvigorated area of study in biology, with spirited scientific discussions on the forces between the low-complexity protein domains within these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies. To illuminate these forces, we determined the atomic structures of five segments from protein low-complexity domains associated with membraneless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies. Their common structural feature is the stacking of segments into kinked β sheets that pair into protofilaments. Unlike steric zippers of amyloid fibrils, the kinked sheets interact weakly through polar atoms and aromatic side chains. By computationally threading the human proteome on our kinked structures, we identified hundreds of low-complexity segments potentially capable of forming such interactions. These segments are found in proteins as diverse as RNA binders, nuclear pore proteins, and keratins, which are known to form networks and localize to membraneless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies.</p>

Mitotic chromosome assembly despite nucleosome depletion in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts

However, it remains unclear whether nucleosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y is indeed an essential prerequisite for mitotic chromosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y.

Roles of RbcX in Carboxysome Biosynthesis in the Cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC7942
<p>Rubisco is the essential enzyme mediating the fixation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> during photosynthesis.

In this study, we investigated the in vivo function of RbcX in the cyanobacterium <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> PCC 7942 (Syn7942) using molecular, biochemical, and live-cell fluorescence imaging approaches. Our results show that genetic deletion of the <i>rbcX</i> gene affects Rubisco abundance, as well as carboxysome formation and spatial distribution. Moreover, RbcX appears as one component of the carboxysome and shows a dynamic interaction with Rubisco enzymes.

T-plastin is essential for basement membrane assembly and epidermal morphogenesis
<p>The establishment of epithelial architecture is a complex process involving cross-talk between cells and the basement membrane. Basement membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y requires integrin activity but the role of the associated actomyosin cytoskeleton is poorly understood. Here, we identify the actin-bundling protein T-plastin (Pls3) as a regulator of basement membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y and epidermal morphogenesis. In utero depletion of <i>Pls3</i> transcripts in mouse embryos caused basement membrane and polarity defects in the epidermis but had little effect on cell adhesion and differentiation. Loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that the apicobasal polarity defects were secondary to the disruption of the basement membrane. However, the basement membrane itself was profoundly sensitive to subtle perturbations in the actin cytoskeleton. We further show that Pls3 localized to the cell cortex, where it was essential for the localization and activation of myosin II. Inhibition of myosin II motor activity disrupted basement membrane organization. Our results provide insights into the regulation of cortical actomyosin and its importance for basement membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y and skin morphogenesis.</p>

Stoichiometry controls activity of phase-separated clusters of actin signaling proteins
<p>Biomolecular condensates concentrate macromolecules into foci without a surrounding membrane. Many condensates appear to form through multivalent interactions that drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). LLPS increases the specific activity of actin regulatory proteins toward actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y by the Arp2/3 complex. We show that this increase occurs because LLPS of the Nephrin–Nck–N-WASP signaling pathway on lipid bilayers increases membrane dwell time of N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex, consequently increasing actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. Dwell time varies with relative stoichiometry of the signaling proteins in the phase-separated clusters, rendering N-WASP and Arp2/3 activity stoichiometry dependent. This mechanism of controlling protein activity is enabled by the stoichiometrically undefined nature of biomolecular condensates. Such regulation should be a general feature of signaling systems that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>e through multivalent interactions and drive nonequilibrium outputs.</p>

Flagellar microtubule doublet assembly in vitro reveals a regulatory role of tubulin C-terminal tails
<p>Microtubule doublets (MTDs), consisting of an incomplete B-microtubule at the surface of a complete A-microtubule, provide a structural scaffold mediating intraflagellar transport and ciliary beating. Despite the fundamental role of MTDs, the molecular mechanism governing their formation is unknown. We used a cell-free assay to demonstrate a crucial inhibitory role of the carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) tail of tubulin in MTD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y. Removal of the C-terminal tail of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed A-microtubule allowed for the nucleation of a B-microtubule on its surface. C-terminal tails of only one A-microtubule protofilament inhibited this side-to-surface tubulin interaction, which would be overcome in vivo with binding protein partners. The dynamics of B-microtubule nucleation and its distinctive isotropic elongation was elucidated by using live imaging. Thus, inherent interaction properties of tubulin provide a structural basis driving flagellar MTD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y.</p>

Emergent simplicity in microbial community assembly

Crystallizing a memory
<p>What is the physical basis of memory? What does it take to retrieve a memory in the brain? What would it take to activate or erase memories? In the early 20th century, the German zoologist Richard Semon coined the term “engram” to denote the physical manifestation of a memory in the brain (<i>1</i>). Two decades later, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb posited a physiological correlate for learning and recollection: The process of learning strengthens the connections, or synapses, between neurons, which leads to the development of brain-wide cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies that undergo changes in their structural and functional connectivity (<i>2</i>). The coordinated activity of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies—called ensembles, traces, or engrams—that occurs during learning (memory formation) is thought to be reengaged during recall and thereby forms a stable neuronal correlate of memory (<i>2</i>). As subsequent memories are formed, the dynamics of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies evolve and provide preexisting scaffolds to influence how the brain processes the variety of memories an organism forms. Studies by Abdou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) on page 1227 of this issue and by Choi <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) develop new technologies to visualize discrete engrams in the brain and modulate them in a synapse-specific manner to understand memory strength and memory restoration from an amnestic state. This improved understanding could eventually be translated to modulate memories to alleviate maladaptive memory states.</p>

Wild emmer genome architecture and diversity elucidate wheat evolution and domestication
<p>Wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) is one of the founder crops that likely drove the Neolithic transition to sedentary agrarian societies in the Fertile Crescent more than 10,000 years ago. Identifying genetic modifications underlying wheat’s domestication requires knowledge about the genome of its allo-tetraploid progenitor, wild emmer (<i>T. turgidum</i> ssp. <i>dicoccoides</i>). We report a 10.1-gigabase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of the 14 chromosomes of wild tetraploid wheat, as well as analyses of gene content, genome architecture, and genetic diversity. With this fully <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed polyploid wheat genome, we identified the causal mutations in <i>Brittle Rachis 1</i> (<i>TtBtr1</i>) genes controlling shattering, a key domestication trait. A study of genomic diversity among wild and domesticated accessions revealed genomic regions bearing the signature of selection under domestication. This reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y will serve as a resource for accelerating the genome-assisted improvement of modern wheat varieties.</p>

Nanoscale-length control of the flagellar driveshaft requires hitting the tethered outer membrane
<p>The bacterial flagellum exemplifies a system where even small deviations from the highly regulated flagellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y process can abolish motility and cause negative physiological outcomes. Consequently, bacteria have evolved elegant and robust regulatory mechanisms to ensure that flagellar morphogenesis follows a defined path, with each component self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ing to predetermined dimensions. The flagellar rod acts as a driveshaft to transmit torque from the cytoplasmic rotor to the external filament. The rod self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>es to a defined length of ~25 nanometers. Here, we provide evidence that rod length is limited by the width of the periplasmic space between the inner and outer membranes. The length of Braun's lipoprotein determines periplasmic width by tethering the outer membrane to the peptidoglycan layer.</p>

High-performance vitrimers from commodity thermoplastics through dioxaborolane metathesis
<p>Windmills, cars, and dental restoration demand polymer materials and composites that are easy to process, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>e, and recycle while exhibiting outstanding mechanical, thermal, and chemical resistance.

Emergence of hierarchical structural complexities in nanoparticles and their assembly

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y tools. The adoption of plasmid vector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological systems. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) system is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile system called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal systems. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression systems using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate system in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The system is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

Dual Sites for SEC11 on the SNARE SYP121 Implicate a Binding Exchange during Secretory Traffic
<p>SNARE (soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins facilitate vesicle traffic through their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y in a heteromeric complex that drives membrane fusion. Much of vesicle traffic at the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plasma membrane is subject to the Sec1/Munc18 protein SEC11, which, along with plasma membrane K<sup>+</sup> channels, selectively binds with the SNARE SYP121 to regulate its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y in complex. How SEC11 binding is coordinated with the K<sup>+</sup> channels is poorly understood, as both SEC11 and the channels are thought to compete for the same SNARE binding site. Here, we identify a second binding motif within the N terminus of SYP121 and demonstrate that this motif affects SEC11 binding independently of the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif that is shared with the K<sup>+</sup> channels. This second, previously unrecognized motif is centered on residues R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> of SYP121 and is essential for SEC11 interaction with SYP121. Mutation of the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif blocked vesicle traffic without uncoupling the effects of SYP121 on solute and K<sup>+</sup> uptake associated with the F<sup>9</sup>xRF motif; the mutation also mimicked the effects on traffic block observed on coexpression of the dominant-negative SEC11<sup>Δ149</sup> fragment. We conclude that the R<sup>20</sup>R<sup>21</sup> motif represents a secondary site of interaction for the Sec1/Munc18 protein during the transition of SYP121 from the occluded to the open conformation that leads to SNARE complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y.</p>

The AAA-ATPase MIDASIN 1 Functions in Ribosome Biogenesis and Is Essential for Embryo and Root Development
<p>Ribosome biogenesis is an orchestrated process that relies on many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y factors. The AAA-ATPase Midasin 1 (Mdn1) functions as a ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y factor in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>), but the roles of MDN1 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we showed that the Arabidopsis null mutant of <i>MDN1</i> is embryo-lethal. Using the weak mutant <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i>, which maintains viability, we found that MDN1 is critical for the regular pattern of auxin maxima in the globular embryo and functions in root meristem maintenance. By detecting the subcellular distribution of ribosome proteins, we noted that <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> impairs nuclear export of the pre-60S ribosomal particle. The processing of ribosomal precusor RNAs, including 35S, 27SB, and 20S, is also affected in this mutant. MDN1 physically interacts with PESCADILLO2 (PES2), an essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y factor of the 60S ribosome, and the observed mislocalization of PES2 in <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> further implied that MDN1 plays an indispensable role in 60S ribosome biogenesis. Therefore, the observed hypersensitivity of <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> to a eukaryotic translation inhibitor and high-sugar conditions might be associated with the defect in ribosome biogenesis. Overall, this work establishes a role of Arabidopsis MDN1 in ribosome biogenesis, which agrees with its roles in embryogenesis and root development.</p>

OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 Form a Transient Functional Complex with the Photosystem II Reaction Center
<p>The reaction center (RC) of photosystem II (PSII), which is composed of D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i> subunits, forms at an early stage of PSII biogenesis. However, it is largely unclear how these components <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>e to form a functional unit. In this work, we show that synthesis of the PSII core proteins D1/D2 and formation of the PSII RC is blocked specifically in the absence of ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) and OHP2 proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), indicating that OHP1 and OHP2 are essential for the formation of the PSII RC. Mutagenesis of the chlorophyll-binding residues in OHP proteins impairs their function and/or stability, suggesting that they may function in the binding of chlorophyll in vivo. We further show that OHP1, OHP2, and HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244), together with D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i>, form a complex. We designated this complex the PSII RC-like complex to distinguish it from the RC subcomplex in the intact PSII complex. Our data imply that OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are present in this PSII RC-like complex for a limited time at an early stage of PSII de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y and of PSII repair under high-light conditions. In a subsequent stage of PSII biogenesis, OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are released from the PSII RC-like complex and replaced by the other PSII subunits. Together with previous reports on the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i>, our results demonstrate that the process of PSII RC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y is highly conserved among photosynthetic species.</p>

ONE-HELIX PROTEIN2 (OHP2) Is Required for the Stability of OHP1 and Assembly Factor HCF244 and Is Functionally Linked to PSII Biogenesis
<p>The members of the light-harvesting complex protein family, which include the one-helix proteins (OHPs), are characterized by one to four membrane-spanning helices. These proteins function in light absorption and energy dissipation, sensing light intensity, and triggering photomorphogenesis or the binding of chlorophyll and intermediates of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains two OHPs, while four homologs (named high-light-induced proteins) exist in <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC6803. Various functions have been assigned to high-light-induced proteins, ranging from photoprotection and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of photosystem I (PSI) and PSII to regulation of the early steps of chlorophyll biosynthesis, but little is known about the function of the two plant OHPs. Here, we show that the two Arabidopsis OHPs form heterodimers and that the stromal part of OHP2 interacts with the plastid-localized PSII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y factor HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244). Moreover, concurrent accumulation of the two OHPs and HCF244 is critical for the stability of all three proteins. In particular, the absence of OHP2 leads to the complete loss of OHP1 and HCF244. We used a virus-induced gene silencing approach to minimize the expression of <i>OHP1</i> or <i>OHP2</i> in adult Arabidopsis plants and revealed that OHP2 is essential for the accumulation of the PSII core subunits, while the other photosynthetic complexes and the major light-harvesting complex proteins remained unaffected. We examined the potential functions of the OHP1-OHP2-HCF244 complex in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y and/or repair of PSII and propose a role for this heterotrimeric complex in thylakoid membrane biogenesis.</p>

Pollen Aperture Factor INP1 Acts Late in Aperture Formation by Excluding Specific Membrane Domains from Exine Deposition
<p>Accurate placement of extracellular materials is a critical part of cellular development. To study how cells achieve this accuracy, we use formation of pollen apertures as a model. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), three regions on the pollen surface lack deposition of pollen wall exine and develop into apertures. In developing pollen, Arabidopsis <i>INAPERTURATE POLLEN1</i> (INP1) protein acts as a marker for the preaperture domains, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ing there into three punctate lines. To understand the mechanism of aperture formation, we studied the dynamics of INP1 expression and localization and its relationship with the membrane domains at which it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>es. We found that INP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y occurs after meiotic cytokinesis at the interface between the plasma membrane and the overlying callose wall, and requires the normal callose wall formation. Sites of INP1 localization coincide with positions of protruding membrane ridges in proximity to the callose wall. Our data suggest that INP1 is a late-acting factor involved in keeping specific membrane domains next to the callose wall to prevent formation of exine at these sites.</p>

Synthesis and Self-Assembly of Cellulose Microfibrils from Reconstituted Cellulose Synthase
<p>Cellulose, the major component of plant cell walls, can be converted to bioethanol and is thus highly studied. In plants, cellulose is produced by cellulose synthase, a processive family-2 glycosyltransferase. In plant cell walls, individual β-1,4-glucan chains polymerized by CesA are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed into microfibrils that are frequently bundled into macrofibrils. An in vitro system in which cellulose is synthesized and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed into fibrils would facilitate detailed study of this process. Here, we report the heterologous expression and partial purification of His-tagged CesA5 from <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Immunoblot analysis and mass spectrometry confirmed enrichment of PpCesA5. The recombinant protein was functional when reconstituted into liposomes made from yeast total lipid extract. The functional studies included incorporation of radiolabeled Glc, linkage analysis, and imaging of cellulose microfibril formation using transmission electron microscopy. Several microfibrils were observed either inside or on the outer surface of proteoliposomes, and strikingly, several thinner fibrils formed ordered bundles that either covered the surfaces of proteoliposomes or were spawned from liposome surfaces. We also report this arrangement of fibrils made by proteoliposomes bearing CesA8 from hybrid aspen. These observations describe minimal systems of membrane-reconstituted CesAs that polymerize β-1,4-glucan chains that coalesce to form microfibrils and higher-ordered macrofibrils. How these micro- and macrofibrils relate to those found in primary and secondary plant cell walls is uncertain, but their presence enables further study of the mechanisms that govern the formation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of fibrillar cellulosic structures and cell wall composites during or after the polymerization process controlled by CesA proteins.</p>

Characterization of Trichome-Expressed BAHD Acyltransferases in <i>Petunia axillaris</i> Reveals Distinct Acylsugar Assembly Mechanisms within the Solanaceae
<p>Acylsugars are synthesized in the glandular trichomes of the Solanaceae family and are implicated in protection against abiotic and biotic stress. Acylsugars are composed of either sucrose or glucose esterified with varying numbers of acyl chains of differing length. In tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), acylsugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y requires four acylsugar acyltransferases (ASATs) of the BAHD superfamily. Tomato ASATs catalyze the sequential esterification of acyl-coenzyme A thioesters to the R4, R3, R3′, and R2 positions of sucrose, yielding a tetra-acylsucrose. <i>Petunia</i> spp. synthesize acylsugars that are structurally distinct from those of tomato. To explore the mechanisms underlying this chemical diversity, a <i>Petunia</i> <i>axillaris</i> transcriptome was mined for trichome preferentially expressed BAHDs. A combination of phylogenetic analyses, gene silencing, and biochemical analyses coupled with structural elucidation of metabolites revealed that acylsugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y is not conserved between tomato and petunia. In <i>P. axillaris</i>, tetra-acylsucrose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y occurs through the action of four ASATs, which catalyze sequential addition of acyl groups to the R2, R4, R3, and R6 positions. Notably, in <i>P. axillaris</i>, PaxASAT1 and PaxASAT4 catalyze the acylation of the R2 and R6 positions of sucrose, respectively, and no clear orthologs exist in tomato. Similarly, petunia acylsugars lack an acyl group at the R3′ position, and congruently, an ortholog of SlASAT3, which catalyzes acylation at the R3′ position in tomato, is absent in <i>P. axillaris</i>. Furthermore, where putative orthologous relationships of ASATs are predicted between tomato and petunia, these are not supported by biochemical assays. Overall, these data demonstrate the considerable evolutionary plasticity of acylsugar biosynthesis.</p>

Importance of Translocon Subunit Tic56 for rRNA Processing and Chloroplast Ribosome Assembly
<p>Toc159-containing complexes at the outer chloroplast envelope membrane form stable supercomplexes with a 1-MD translocon at the inner chloroplast envelope membrane of which Tic56 is one essential subunit. While the single mutants <i>tic56-1</i> and <i>ppi2</i> (<i>toc159</i>) have an albino phenotype and are able to grow heterotrophically, we find the double mutant to be embryo lethal. Comprehensive quantitative proteome profiling with both single mutants in combination with GeneChip analyses identified a posttranscriptional defect in the accumulation of plastid ribosomal proteins and diminished expression of plastid encoded proteins. In the <i>tic56-1</i> mutant, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of functional ribosomes is furthermore hampered by a processing defect of the plastid 23S rRNA. Spectinomycin-treatment of wild-type plants phenocopies the molecular phenotype of plastid proteome accumulation in <i>tic56-1</i> and to a smaller degree also <i>ppi2</i> plastids, suggesting that a defect in plastid translation is largely responsible for the phenotype of both import mutants. Import experiments with the <i>tic56-3</i> mutant revealed no significant defect in the import of small ribosomal protein 16 in the absence of full-length Tic56, suggesting that the defect in ribosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y in <i>tic56-1</i> may be independent of a function of Tic56 in protein import. Our data establish a previously unknown link between plastid protein import, the processing of plastid rRNAs, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of plastid ribosomes and provide further knowledge on the function of the translocon components and the molecular basis for their albino phenotype.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic networks can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing such networks is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> a phylogenetic network from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic network. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition.

However, most of these methods have not been implemented as tools or web servers. Researchers cannot use these methods easily with their data sets. To facilitate the usage of various alignment-free methods, we implemented most of the popular alignment-free methods and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed a user-friendly web server for alignment-free genome phylogeny (AGP). AGP integrated the phylogenetic tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion, visualization, and comparison functions together. Both AGP and all source code of the methods are available at <ext-link>http://www.herbbol.org:8000/agp</ext-link> (last accessed February 26, 2013). AGP will facilitate research in the field of whole-genome phylogeny and comparison.</p>

Genome-Wide Landscape of Alternative Splicing Events in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>
<p>Recently, <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> has emerged as a model plant for studying monocot grasses and cereal crops. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed expressed transcript sequences and subsequent mapping to the corresponding genome, we identified 1219 alternative splicing (AS) events spanning across 2021 putatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed transcripts generated from 941 genes. Approximately, 6.3% of expressed genes are alternatively spliced in <i>B. distachyon</i>. We observed that a majority of the identified AS events were related to retained introns (55.5%), followed by alternative acceptor sites (16.7%). We also observed a low percentage of exon skipping (5.0%) and alternative donor site events (8.8%). The ‘complex event’ that consists of a combination of two or more basic splicing events accounted for ∼14.0%. Comparative AS transcript analysis revealed 163 and 39 homologous pairs between <i>B. distachyon</i> and <i>Oryza sativa</i> and between <i>B. distachyon</i> and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, respectively<i>.</i> In all, we found 16 AS transcripts to be conserved in all 3 species. AS events and related putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed transcripts annotation can be systematically browsed at Plant Alternative Splicing Database (<ext-link>http://proteomics.ysu.edu/altsplice/plant/</ext-link>).</p>

Mechanical Stress Conditioning and Electrical Stimulation Promote Contractility and Force Maturation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Human Cardiac Tissue
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Tissue engineering enables the generation of functional human cardiac tissue with cells derived in vitro in combination with biocompatible materials. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes provide a cell source for cardiac tissue engineering; however, their immaturity limits their potential applications. Here we sought to study the effect of mechanical conditioning and electric pacing on the maturation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells were used to generate collagen-based bioengineered human cardiac tissue. Engineered tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>s were subjected to different mechanical stress and electric pacing conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The engineered human myocardium exhibits Frank-Starling–type force-length relationships. After 2 weeks of static stress conditioning, the engineered myocardium demonstrated increases in contractility (0.63±0.10 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 0.055±0.009 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> for no stress), tensile stiffness, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> alignment, and cell size. Stress conditioning also increased SERCA2 (Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase 2) expression, which correlated with a less negative force-frequency relationship. When electric pacing was combined with static stress conditioning, the tissues showed an additional increase in force production (1.34±0.19 mN/mm<sup>2</sup>), with no change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> alignment or cell size, suggesting maturation of excitation-contraction coupling. Supporting this notion, we found expression of RYR2 (Ryanodine Receptor 2) and SERCA2 further increased by combined static stress and electric stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These studies demonstrate that electric pacing and mechanical stimulation promote maturation of the structural, mechanical, and force generation properties of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues.</p></sec>

Controlled growth and form of precipitating microsculptures
<p>Controlled self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of three-dimensional shapes holds great potential for fabrication of functional materials. Their practical realization requires a theoretical framework to quantify and guide the dynamic sculpting of the curved structures that often arise in accretive mineralization. Motivated by a variety of bioinspired coprecipitation patterns of carbonate and silica, we develop a geometrical theory for the kinetics of the growth front that leaves behind thin-walled complex structures. Our theory explains the range of previously observed experimental patterns and, in addition, predicts unexplored <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y pathways. This allows us to design a number of functional base shapes of optical microstructures, which we synthesize to demonstrate their light-guiding capabilities. Overall, our framework provides a way to understand and control the growth and form of functional precipitating microsculptures.</p>

Self-assembly of genetically encoded DNA-protein hybrid nanoscale shapes
<p>We describe an approach to bottom-up fabrication that allows integration of the functional diversity of proteins into designed three-dimensional structural frameworks. A set of custom staple proteins based on transcription activator–like effector proteins folds a double-stranded DNA template into a user-defined shape. Each staple protein is designed to recognize and closely link two distinct double-helical DNA sequences at separate positions on the template. We present design rules for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing megadalton-scale DNA-protein hybrid shapes; introduce various structural motifs, such as custom curvature, corners, and vertices; and describe principles for creating multilayer DNA-protein objects with enhanced rigidity. We demonstrate self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y of our hybrid nanostructures in one-pot mixtures that include the genetic information for the designed proteins, the template DNA, RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and cofactors for transcription and translation.</p>

Cryo-EM structures of the triheteromeric NMDA receptor and its allosteric modulation
<p><i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are heterotetrameric ion channels <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed as diheteromeric or triheteromeric complexes. Here, we report structures of the triheteromeric GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B receptor in the absence or presence of the GluN2B-specific allosteric modulator Ro 25-6981 (Ro), determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In the absence of Ro, the GluN2A and GluN2B amino-terminal domains (ATDs) adopt “closed” and “open” clefts, respectively. Upon binding Ro, the GluN2B ATD clamshell transitions from an open to a closed conformation. Consistent with a predominance of the GluN2A subunit in ion channel gating, the GluN2A subunit interacts more extensively with GluN1 subunits throughout the receptor, in comparison with the GluN2B subunit. Differences in the conformation of the pseudo-2-fold–related GluN1 subunits further reflect receptor asymmetry. The triheteromeric NMDAR structures provide the first view of the most common NMDA receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y and show how incorporation of two different GluN2 subunits modifies receptor symmetry and subunit interactions, allowing each subunit to uniquely influence receptor structure and function, thus increasing receptor complexity.</p>

“Perfect” designer chromosome V and behavior of a ring derivative
<p>Perfect matching of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ed physical sequence to a specified designed sequence is crucial to verify design principles in genome synthesis. We designed and de novo synthesized 536,024–base pair chromosome synV in the “Build-A-Genome China” course. We corrected an initial isolate of synV to perfectly match the designed sequence using integrative cotransformation and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)–mediated editing in 22 steps; synV strains exhibit high fitness under a variety of culture conditions, compared with that of wild-type V strains. A ring synV derivative was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed, which is fully functional in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> under all conditions tested and exhibits lower spore viability during meiosis. Ring synV chromosome can extends Sc2.0 design principles and provides a model with which to study genomic rearrangement, ring chromosome evolution, and human ring chromosome disorders.</p>

Formation of α-chiral centers by asymmetric β-C(sp<sup>3</sup>)–H arylation, alkenylation, and alkynylation
<p>The enzymatic β-C–H hydroxylation of the feedstock chemical isobutyric acid has enabled the asymmetric synthesis of a wide variety of polyketides. The analogous transition metal–catalyzed enantioselective β-C–H functionalization of isobutyric acid–derived substrates should provide a versatile method for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing useful building blocks with enantioenriched α-chiral centers from this abundant C-4 skeleton. However, the desymmetrization of ubiquitous isopropyl moieties by organometallic catalysts has remained an unanswered challenge. Herein, we report the design of chiral mono-protected aminomethyl oxazoline ligands that enable desymmetrization of isopropyl groups via palladium insertion into the C(sp<sup>3</sup>)–H bonds of one of the prochiral methyl groups. We detail the enantioselective β-arylation, -alkenylation, and -alkynylation of isobutyric acid/2-aminoisobutyric acid derivatives, which may serve as a platform for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion of α-chiral centers.</p>

Superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex replay independently of the hippocampus
<p>The hippocampus is thought to initiate systems-wide mnemonic processes through the reactivation of previously acquired spatial and episodic memory traces, which can recruit the entorhinal cortex as a first stage of memory redistribution to other brain areas. Hippocampal reactivation occurs during sharp wave–ripples, in which synchronous network firing encodes sequences of places. We investigated the coordination of this replay by recording <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>y activity simultaneously in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex. We found that entorhinal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assembl</span></strong>ies can replay trajectories independently of the hippocampus and sharp wave–ripples. This suggests that the hippocampus is not the sole initiator of spatial and episodic memory trace reactivation. Memory systems involved in these processes may include nonhierarchical, parallel components.</p>

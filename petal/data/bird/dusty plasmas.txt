Is Permanent Parasitism Reversible?—Critical Evidence from Early Evolution of House Dust Mites
<p>Long-term specialization may limit the ability of a species to respond to new environmental conditions and lead to a higher likelihood of extinction. For permanent parasites and other symbionts, the most intriguing question is whether these organisms can return to a free-living lifestyle and, thus, escape an evolutionary “dead end.” This question is directly related to Dollo's law, which stipulates that a complex trait (such as being free living vs. parasitic) cannot re-evolve again in the same form. Here, we present conclusive evidence that house <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> mites, a group of medically important free-living organisms, evolved from permanent parasites of warm-blooded vertebrates. A robust, multigene topology (315 taxa, 8942 nt), ancestral character state reconstruction, and a test for irreversible evolution (Dollo's law) demonstrate that house <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> mites have abandoned a parasitic lifestyle, secondarily becoming free living, and then speciated in several habitats. Hence, as exemplified by this model system, highly specialized permanent parasites may drastically de-specialize to the extent of becoming free living and, thus escape from dead-end evolution. Our phylogenetic and historical ecological framework explains the limited cross-reactivity between allergens from the house <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> mites and “storage” mites and the ability of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> mites to inhibit host immune responses. It also provides insights into how ancestral features related to parasitism (frequent ancestral shifts to unrelated hosts, tolerance to lower humidity, and pre-existing enzymes targeting skin and keratinous materials) played a major role in reversal to the free-living state. We propose that parasitic ancestors of pyroglyphids shifted to nests of vertebrates. Later the nest-inhabiting pyroglyphids expanded into human dwellings to become a major source of allergens.

Dust grains fall from Saturn’s D-ring into its equatorial upper atmosphere
<p>The sizes of Saturn’s ring particles range from meters (boulders) to nanometers (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong>). Determination of the rings’ ages depends on loss processes, including the transport of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> into Saturn’s atmosphere. During the Grand Finale orbits of the Cassini spacecraft, its instruments measured tiny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> grains that compose the innermost D-ring of Saturn. The nanometer-sized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> experiences collisions with exospheric (upper atmosphere) hydrogen and molecular hydrogen, which forces it to fall from the ring into the ionosphere and lower atmosphere. We used the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument to detect and characterize this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> transport and also found that diffusion dominates above and near the altitude of peak ionospheric density. This mechanism results in a mass deposition into the equatorial atmosphere of ~5 kilograms per second, constraining the age of the D-ring.</p>

The multiple merger assembly of a hyperluminous obscured quasar at redshift 4.6
<p>Galaxy mergers and gas accretion from the cosmic web drove the growth of galaxies and their central black holes at early epochs. We report spectroscopic imaging of a multiple merger event in the most luminous known galaxy, WISE J224607.56−052634.9 (W2246−0526), a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong>-obscured quasar at redshift 4.6, 1.3 billion years after the Big Bang. Far-infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> continuum observations show three galaxy companions around W2246−0526 with disturbed morphologies, connected by streams of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> likely produced by the dynamical interaction. The detection of tidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong>y bridges shows that W2246−0526 is accreting its neighbors, suggesting that merger activity may be a dominant mechanism through which the most luminous galaxies simultaneously obscure and feed their central supermassive black holes.</p>

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings
<p>Saturn has a sufficiently strong dipole magnetic field to trap high-energy charged particles and form radiation belts, which have been observed outside its rings. Whether stable radiation belts exist near the planet and inward of the rings was previously unknown. The Cassini spacecraft’s Magnetosphere Imaging Instrument obtained measurements of a radiation belt that lies just above Saturn’s dense atmosphere and is decoupled from the rest of the magnetosphere by the planet’s A- to C-rings. The belt extends across the D-ring and comprises protons produced through cosmic ray albedo neutron decay and multiple charge-exchange reactions. These protons are lost to atmospheric neutrals and D-ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong>. Strong proton depletions that map onto features on the D-ring indicate a highly structured and diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> environment near Saturn.</p>

A dust-enshrouded tidal disruption event with a resolved radio jet in a galaxy merger
<p>Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are transient flares produced when a star is ripped apart by the gravitational field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). We have observed a transient source in the western nucleus of the merging galaxy pair Arp 299 that radiated >1.5 × 10<sup>52</sup> erg at infrared and radio wavelengths but was not luminous at optical or x-ray wavelengths. We interpret this as a TDE with much of its emission reradiated at infrared wavelengths by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong>. Efficient reprocessing by dense gas and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> may explain the difference between theoretical predictions and observed luminosities of TDEs. The radio observations resolve an expanding and decelerating jet, probing the jet formation and evolution around a SMBH.</p>

TSLP signaling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells programs a pathogenic T helper 2 cell state
<p>Pathogenic T helper 2 (T<sub>H</sub>2) cells, which produce increased amounts of the cytokines interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13, promote allergic disorders, including asthma. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine secreted by epithelial and innate immune cells, stimulates such pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 cell responses. We found that TSLP signaling in mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells initiated transcriptional changes associated with T<sub>H</sub>2 cell programming. IL-4 signaling amplified and stabilized the genomic response of T cells to TSLP, which increased the frequency of T cells producing IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. Furthermore, the TSLP- and IL-4–programmed T<sub>H</sub>2 cells had a pathogenic phenotype, producing greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 and other proinflammatory cytokines than did T<sub>H</sub>2 cells stimulated with IL-4 alone. TSLP-mediated T<sub>H</sub>2 cell induction involved distinct molecular pathways, including activation of the transcription factor STAT5 through the kinase JAK2 and repression of the transcription factor BCL6. Mice that received wild-type CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had exacerbated pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 cell responses upon exposure to house <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> mites compared to mice that received TSLP receptor–deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Transient TSLP signaling stably programmed pathogenic potential in memory T<sub>H</sub>2 cells. In human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, TSLP and IL-4 promoted the generation of T<sub>H</sub>2 cells that produced greater amounts of IL-5 and IL-13. Compared to healthy controls, asthmatic children showed enhancement of such T cell responses in peripheral blood. Our data support a sequential cytokine model for pathogenic T<sub>H</sub>2 cell differentiation and provide a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic targeting of TSLP signaling in human allergic diseases.</p>

The FOXM1 inhibitor RCM-1 suppresses goblet cell metaplasia and prevents IL-13 and STAT6 signaling in allergen-exposed mice
<p>Goblet cell metaplasia and excessive mucus secretion associated with asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease contribute to morbidity and mortality worldwide. We performed a high-throughput screen to identify small molecules targeting a transcriptional network critical for the differentiation of goblet cells in response to allergens. We identified RCM-1, a nontoxic small molecule that inhibited goblet cell metaplasia and excessive mucus production in mice after exposure to allergens. RCM-1 blocked the nuclear localization and increased the proteasomal degradation of Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), a transcription factor critical for the differentiation of goblet cells from airway progenitor cells. RCM-1 reduced airway resistance, increased lung compliance, and decreased proinflammatory cytokine production in mice exposed to the house <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> mite and interleukin-13 (IL-13), which triggers goblet cell metaplasia. In cultured airway epithelial cells and in mice, RCM-1 reduced IL-13 and STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6) signaling and prevented the expression of the STAT6 target genes <i>Spdef</i> and <i>Foxa3</i>, which are key transcriptional regulators of goblet cell differentiation. These results suggest that RCM-1 is an inhibitor of goblet cell metaplasia and IL-13 signaling, providing a new therapeutic candidate to treat patients with asthma and other chronic airway diseases.</p>

Resonance-stabilized hydrocarbon-radical chain reactions may explain soot inception and growth
<p>Mystery surrounds the transition from gas-phase hydrocarbon precursors to terrestrial soot and interstellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong>, which are carbonaceous particles formed under similar conditions. Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known precursors to high-temperature carbonaceous-particle formation, the molecular pathways that initiate particle formation are unknown. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for rapid molecular clustering–reaction pathways involving radicals with extended conjugation. These radicals react with other hydrocarbon species to form covalently bound complexes that promote further growth and clustering by regenerating resonance-stabilized radicals through low-barrier hydrogen-abstraction and hydrogen-ejection reactions. Such radical–chain reaction pathways may lead to covalently bound clusters of PAHs and other hydrocarbons that would otherwise be too small to condense at high temperatures, thus providing the key mechanistic steps for rapid particle formation and surface growth by hydrocarbon chemisorption.</p>

Fast molecular outflow from a dusty star-forming galaxy in the early Universe
<p>Galaxies grow inefficiently, with only a small percentage of the available gas converted into stars each free-fall time. Feedback processes, such as outflowing winds driven by radiation pressure, supernovae, or supermassive black hole accretion, can act to halt star formation if they heat or expel the gas supply. We report a molecular outflow launched from a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong>-rich star-forming galaxy at redshift 5.3, 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The outflow reaches velocities up to 800 kilometers per second relative to the galaxy, is resolved into multiple clumps, and carries mass at a rate within a factor of 2 of the star formation rate. Our results show that molecular outflows can remove a large fraction of the gas available for star formation from galaxies at high redshift.</p>

Mapping spiral structure on the far side of the Milky Way
<p>Little is known about the portion of the Milky Way lying beyond the Galactic center at distances of more than 9 kiloparsec from the Sun. These regions are opaque at optical wavelengths because of absorption by interstellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong>, and distances are very large and hard to measure. We report a direct trigonometric parallax distance of <bold>[Formula]</bold> kiloparsec obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array to a water maser source in a region of active star formation. These measurements allow us to shed light on Galactic spiral structure by locating the Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm as it passes through the far side of the Milky Way and to validate a kinematic method for determining distances in this region on the basis of transverse motions.</p>

[C <sc>ii</sc>] 158-μm emission from the host galaxies of damped Lyman-alpha systems
<p>Gas surrounding high-redshift galaxies has been studied through observations of absorption line systems toward background quasars for decades. However, it has proven difficult to identify and characterize the galaxies associated with these absorbers due to the intrinsic faintness of the galaxies compared with the quasars at optical wavelengths. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, we report on detections of [C <sc>ii</sc>] 158-μm line and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong>-continuum emission from two galaxies associated with two such absorbers at a redshift of <i>z</i> ~ 4. Our results indicate that the hosts of these high-metallicity absorbers have physical properties similar to massive star-forming galaxies and are embedded in enriched neutral hydrogen gas reservoirs that extend well beyond the star-forming interstellar medium of these galaxies.</p>

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p>Ice formation on aerosol particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level. This is partly because the nature of active sites, local surface features where ice growth commences, is still unclear. Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong>. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential nucleation of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) surface planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) surface, exposed at surface defects such as steps, cracks, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high ice nucleation efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar particles.</p>

Rosetta’s comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko sheds its dusty mantle to reveal its icy nature
<p>The Rosetta spacecraft has investigated comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko from large heliocentric distances to its perihelion passage and beyond. We trace the seasonal and diurnal evolution of the colors of the 67P nucleus, finding changes driven by sublimation and recondensation of water ice. The whole nucleus became relatively bluer near perihelion, as increasing activity removed the surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong>, implying that water ice is widespread underneath the surface. We identified large (1500 square meters) ice-rich patches appearing and then vanishing in about 10 days, indicating small-scale heterogeneities on the nucleus. Thin frosts sublimating in a few minutes are observed close to receding shadows, and rapid variations in color are seen on extended areas close to the terminator. These cyclic processes are widespread and lead to continuously, slightly varying surface properties.</p>

Spiral density waves in a young protoplanetary disk
<p>Gravitational forces are expected to excite spiral density waves in protoplanetary disks, disks of gas and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dust</span></strong> orbiting young stars. However, previous observations that showed spiral structure were not able to probe disk midplanes, where most of the mass is concentrated and where planet formation takes place. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we detected a pair of trailing symmetric spiral arms in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the young star Elias 2-27. The arms extend to the disk outer regions and can be traced down to the midplane. These millimeter-wave observations also reveal an emission gap closer to the star than the spiral arms. We argue that the observed spirals trace shocks of spiral density waves in the midplane of this young disk.</p>

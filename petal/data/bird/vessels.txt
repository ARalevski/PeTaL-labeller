The colonisation of the glenohumeral joint by <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i> is not associated with frozen shoulder but is more likely to occur after an injection into the joint
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of <i>Propionibacterium   (P.) acnes</i> in the subcutaneous fat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e of patients   undergoing shoulder surgery for frozen shoulder or instability.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 46 patients undergoing either an arthroscopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>ar   release or stabilisation had biopsies taken from the subcutaneous   fat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e of the shoulder at the time of surgery. These samples   were sent for culture in enrichment, and also for Nucleic Acid Amplification   testing. The prevalence of <i>P. acnes</i> and other microbes   was recorded. Fisher's exact test of binary variables was used to   calculate the association with significance set at p < 0.05.   Assessment of influence of independent variables including a pre-operative   glenohumeral injection, fat colonisation and gender, was undertaken   using binary linear regression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 25 patients (53%) had <i>P. acnes</i> in   one or more tissue samples and 35 (74%) had other bacterial species.   The same microbe was found in the subcutaneous fat and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e   in 13 patients (28%). There was no statistically significant association   between the surgical pathology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>ar colonisation with <i>P.   acnes</i> (p = 0.18) or mixed identified bacterial species   (p = 0.77). Male gender was significantly associated with an increased   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>ar colonisation of <i>P. acnes</i> (odds ratio (OR)   12.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43 to 106.77, p = 0.02). A   pre-operative glenohumeral injection was significantly associated   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>ar <i>P. acnes</i> colonisation (OR 5.63, 95%   CI 1.07 to 29.61, p = 0.04. Positive fat colonisation with <i>P.   acnes</i> was significantly associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>ar <i>P.   acnes</i> (OR 363, 95% CI 20.90 to 6304.19, p < 0.01). Regression   models pseudo R<sup>2</sup> found fat colonisation with <i>P. acnes</i> to   explain 70% of the variance of the model. Patients who had a pre-operative   glenohumeral injection who were found intra-operatively to have   fat colonisation with <i>P. acnes</i> had a statistically   significant association with colonisation of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e with <i>P. acnes</i> (OR   165, 95% CI 13.51 to 2015.24, p < 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results show a statistically significant association between   subcutaneous skin <i>P. acnes</i> culture and <i>P.   acnes</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>ar culture, especially when the patient has   undergone a previous injection. The results refute the hypothesis that <i>P.   acnes</i> causes frozen shoulder.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1067–72.</p></sec>

Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic in total knee arthroplasty; is posterior capsular infiltration worth the risk?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic provides effective   control of pain in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).   There is little information about the added benefits of posterior   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>ar infiltration (PCI) using different combinations of local   anaesthetic agents. Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness   of the control of pain using multimodal infiltration with and without   infiltration of the posterior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial of patients scheduled   for unilateral primary TKA, 86 were assigned to be treated with   multimodal infiltration with (Group I) or without (Group II) PCI.   Routine associated analgesia included the use of bupivacaine, morphine,   ketorolac and epinephrine. All patients had spinal anaesthesia and patient-controlled   analgesia (PCA) post-operatively. A visual analogue scale (VAS)   for pain and the use of morphine were recorded 24 hours post-operatively.   Side effects of the infiltration, blood loss, and length of stay   in hospital were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no statistically significant differences between the   groups in relation to: VAS pain scores in the first 24 hours post-operatively   (p = 0.693), the use of morphine in the PCA (p = 0.647), blood loss   (p = 0.625), and length of stay (p = 0.17). There were no neurovascular   complications in either group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic with infiltration   of the posterior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e did not provide significant added analgesic   benefits or reduce the use of morphine after TKA. Multimodal infiltration   is a satisfactory technique for the management of pain in these   patients without the attendant risks of PCI.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017; 99-B:483–8.</p></sec>

Low–interfacial toughness materials for effective large-scale deicing
<p>Ice accretion has adverse effects on a range of commercial and residential activities. The force required to remove ice from a surface is typically considered to scale with the iced area. This imparts a scalability limit to the use of icephobic coatings for structures with large surface areas, such as power lines or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ship</span></strong> hulls. We describe a class of materials that exhibit a low interfacial toughness with ice, resulting in systems for which the forces required to remove large areas of ice (a few square centimeters or greater) are both low and independent of the iced area. We further demonstrate that coatings made of such materials allow ice to be shed readily from large areas (~1 square meter) merely by self-weight.</p>

CRMP2-binding compound, edonerpic maleate, accelerates motor function recovery from brain damage
<p>Brain damage such as stroke is a devastating neurological condition that may severely compromise patient quality of life. No effective medication-mediated intervention to accelerate rehabilitation has been established. We found that a small compound, edonerpic maleate, facilitated experience-driven synaptic glutamate AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic-acid) receptor delivery and resulted in the acceleration of motor function recovery after motor cortex cryoinjury in mice in a training-dependent manner through cortical reorganization. Edonerpic bound to collapsin-response-mediator-protein 2 (CRMP2) and failed to augment recovery in CRMP2-deficient mice. Edonerpic maleate enhanced motor function recovery from internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e hemorrhage in nonhuman primates. Thus, edonerpic maleate, a neural plasticity enhancer, could be a clinically potent small compound with which to accelerate rehabilitation after brain damage.</p>

Use of cholera vaccines expands, raising hopes
<p>This could be a pivotal year in the fight against cholera, public health experts say. The disease has taken a large toll in the last months: In war-torn Yemen the number of cases reached more than a million; outbreaks ravaged South Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia, and other African countries; and Haiti continues to suffer from the disease. But an emergency vaccine stockpile established in 2013 has grown rapidly and a new, easier-to-use formulation has hit the market, making large-scale campaigns feasible. Soon, 2.4 million doses are to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ship</span></strong>ped to Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where another epidemic looms. With interventions like this, experts hope to make a dent in the global burden of cholera, estimated at 3 million cases a year. And Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which is funding the stockpile, is set to decide later this year whether it will start funding routine immunizations in endemic areas as well.</p>

Metallosis following implantation of magnetically controlled growing rods in the treatment of scoliosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present a case series of five patients who had revision surgery   following magnetic controlled growing rods (MGCR) for early onset   scoliosis. Metallosis was found during revision in four out of five   patients and we postulated a mechanism for rod failure based on   retrieval analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Retrieval analysis was performed on the seven explanted rods.   The mean duration of MCGR from implantation to revision was 35 months   (17 to 46). The mean age at revision was 12 years (7 to 15; four   boys, one girl).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of six out of seven rods had tissue metallosis and pseudo-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e   surrounding the actuator. A total of four out of seven rods were   pistoning. There were two rods which were broken. All rods had abrasive   circumferential markings. A significant amount of metal debris was   found when the actuators were carefully cut open. Analytical electron   microscopy demonstrated metal fragments of predominantly titanium   with a mean particle size of 3.36 microns (1.31 to 6.61).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study highlights concerns with tissue metallosis in MCGR.   We recommend careful follow-up of patients who have received this   implant.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1662–7.</p></sec>

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navi</span></strong>cular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relation<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ship</span></strong>s, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navi</span></strong>cular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navi</span></strong>cular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capsul</span></strong>e of the talo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navi</span></strong>cular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navi</span></strong>cular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navi</span></strong>cular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navi</span></strong>cular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for fractures of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">navi</span></strong>cular that gives associated injuries   involving the lateral column due consideration. We have shown that   this system is reliable and reproducible and have described the   rationale for the subsequent treatment of each type.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:176–82.</p></sec>

<i>pheno</i>Seeder - A Robot System for Automated Handling and Phenotyping of Individual Seeds
<p>The enormous diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> traits is an intriguing feature and critical for the overwhelming success of higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In particular, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> mass is generally regarded to be key for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development but is mostly approximated by using scanning methods delivering only two-dimensional data, often termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> size. However, three-dimensional traits, such as the volume or mass of single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, are very rarely determined in routine measurements. Here, we introduce a device named <i>pheno</i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>er, which enables the handling and phenotyping of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of very different sizes. The system consists of a pick-and-place robot and a modular setup of sensors that can be versatilely extended. Basic biometric traits detected for individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s are two-dimensional data from projections, three-dimensional data from volumetric measures, and mass, from which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> density is also calculated. Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> is tracked by an identifier and, after phenotyping, can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>ed, sorted, or individually stored for further evaluation or processing (e.g. in routine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-to-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tracking pipelines). By investigating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), rape<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> (<i>Brassica napus</i>), and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), we observed that, even for apparently round-shaped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of rape<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>, correlations between the projected area and the mass of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s were much weaker than between volume and mass. This indicates that simple projections may not deliver good proxies for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> mass. Although throughput is limited, we expect that automated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> phenotyping on a single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> basis can contribute valuable information for applications in a wide range of wild or crop species, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> classification, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> sorting, and assessment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> quality.</p>

Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> viruses are spread from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted viruses manipulate the release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting virus spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected with these viruses, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and one of its host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Therefore, the frequency of virus acquisition and the virus load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s than on CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of RNAi protein to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

Gall induction may benefit host plant: a case of a gall wasp and eucalyptus tree
<p>Gall-inducing insects display intimate interactions with their host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, usually described as parasitic relationships; the galls seem to favor the galler alone. We report on a case in which the presence of the galls induced by <i>Leptocybe invasa</i> Fisher & LaSalle (Hymenoptera; Eulophidae) benefit its host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, the river red gum <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh. Field observations showed that <i>E. camaldulensis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected by this gall wasp were less susceptible to cold injury than neighboring conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s without galls. In the laboratory, frost resistance was compared between galled and non-galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s which were both divided into two subgroups: cold-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s that were non-acclimated. Galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed higher frost resistance than the non-galled ones, and the differences were higher in non-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with acclimated ones. Physiological changes in host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> were determined by chemical analyses of chlorophylls, proteins, soluble sugars and anthocyanin contents. The results showed higher values of all physiological parameters in the galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of the gall wasp induces physiological changes on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> foliage, which may in turn increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense mechanisms against cold. Therefore, the toll of galling by the herbivore may pay off by the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> acquiring increased frost resistance. This work provides evidence for physiological changes induced by a herbivore which might have a positive indirect effect on the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, promoting frost resistance such as cold acclimation.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> N use efficiency. The modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and produce more biomass and higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yields than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s as control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

Plant-soil feedback and the maintenance of diversity in Mediterranean-climate shrublands
<p>Soil biota influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-soil feedback, but it is unclear whether the strength of such feedback depends on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> traits and whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-soil feedback drives local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> diversity. We grew 16 co-occurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> species with contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies from hyperdiverse Australian shrublands and exposed them to soil biota from under their own or other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> species. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses to soil biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Simulations revealed that such strategy-dependent feedback is sufficient to maintain the high taxonomic and functional diversity characterizing these Mediterranean-climate shrublands. Our study identifies nutrient-acquisition strategy as a key trait explaining how different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses to soil biota promote local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> diversity.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed chlorophyll degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> and no reduction in <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to accumulate biomass and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> biomass combined with delayed chlorophyll degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

A Maternally Deposited Endosperm Cuticle Contributes to the Physiological Defects of <i>transparent testa</i> Seeds
<p>Mature dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s are highly resilient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> structures where the encapsulated embryo is kept protected and dormant to facilitate its ultimate dispersion. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> viability is heavily dependent on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat’s capacity to shield living tissues from mechanical and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat, also called the testa, arises after the differentiation of maternal ovular integuments during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development. We recently described a thick cuticle tightly embedded in the mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>’s endosperm cell wall. We show here that it is produced by the maternal inner integument 1 layer and, remarkably, transferred to the developing endosperm. Arabidopsis <i>transparent testa</i> (<i>tt</i>) mutations cause maternally derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat pigmentation defects. <i>TT</i> gene products encode proteins involved in flavonoid metabolism and regulators of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat development. <i>tt</i> mutants have abnormally high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat permeability, resulting in lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> viability and dormancy. However, the biochemical basis of this high permeability is not fully understood. We show that the cuticles of developing <i>tt</i> mutant integuments have profound structural defects, which are associated with enhanced cuticle permeability. Genetic analysis indicates that a functional proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway is required to limit cuticle permeability, and our results suggest that proanthocyanidins could be intrinsic components of the cuticle. Together, these results show that the formation of a maternal cuticle is an intrinsic part of the normal integumental differentiation program leading to testa formation and is essential for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>’s physiological properties.</p>

Repression of CYSTATHIONINE <i>γ</i>-SYNTHASE in Seeds Recruits the <i>S</i>-Methylmethionine Cycle
<p><i>S</i>-Methylmethionine (SMM) was suggested previously to participate in the metabolism of methionine (Met) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. To further reveal its roles, we had previously produced transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RNA interference (RNAi) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s with lower transcript expression of CYSTATHIONINE γ-SYNTHASE (<i>AtCGS</i>), Met’s main regulatory enzyme. Unexpectedly, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s accumulated significantly higher levels of Met compared with control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s through an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, transcript and metabolic analyses coupled with isotope-labeled [<sup>13</sup>C]SMM and [<sup>13</sup>C]Met feeding experiments enabled us to reveal that SMM that was synthesized in rosette leaves of RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s significantly contributed to the accumulation of Met in their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s at late stages of development. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-specific repression of <i>AtCGS</i> in RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s triggered the induction of genes operating in the SMM cycle of rosette leaves, leading to elevated transport of SMM toward the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, where higher reconversion rates of SMM to Met were detected. The metabolic rearrangements in RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s resulted in an altered sulfur-associated metabolism, such as lower amounts of Cys and glutathione, as well as a differential composition of glucosinolates. Together, the data propose a novel cross talk existing between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and rosette leaves along with mutual effects between the Asp family and SMM pathways operating in these tissues. They also shed light on the effects of higher Met levels on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> physiology and behavior.</p>

Importance of Fluctuations in Light on Plant Photosynthetic Acclimation
<p>The acclimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to light has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effect of dynamic fluctuations in light on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phenotype and acclimatory responses. We mimicked natural fluctuations in light over a diurnal period to examine the effect on the photosynthetic processes and growth of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). High and low light intensities, delivered via a realistic dynamic fluctuating or square wave pattern, were used to grow and assess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s subjected to square wave light had thicker leaves and greater photosynthetic capacity compared with fluctuating light-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. This, together with elevated levels of proteins associated with electron transport, indicates greater investment in leaf structural components and photosynthetic processes. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating light had thinner leaves, lower leaf light absorption, but maintained similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area to square wave-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Despite high light use efficiency, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating light had a slow growth rate early in development, likely due to the fact that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating conditions were not able to fully utilize the light energy absorbed for carbon fixation. Diurnal leaf-level measurements revealed a negative feedback control of photosynthesis, resulting in a decrease in total diurnal carbon assimilated of at least 20%. These findings highlight that growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under square wave growth conditions ultimately fails to predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance under realistic light regimes and stress the importance of considering fluctuations in incident light in future experiments that aim to infer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> productivity under natural conditions in the field.</p>

Isoscapes resolve species-specific spatial patterns in plant–plant interactions in an invaded Mediterranean dune ecosystem
<p>Environmental heterogeneity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions are key factors shaping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> communities. However, the spatial dimension of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions has seldom been addressed in field studies. This is at least partially rooted in a lack of methods that can accurately resolve functional processes in a spatially explicit manner. Isoscapes, that is, spatially explicit representations of stable isotope data, provide a versatile means to trace functional changes on spatial scales, for example, related to N-cycling (foliar δ<sup>15</sup>N) and water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub>, foliar δ<sup>13</sup>C). In a case study in a nutrient-depleted Mediterranean dune ecosystem, we analysed the spatial impact of the invasive N<sub>2</sub>-fixing <i>Acacia longifolia</i> on three native species of different functional types using δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Isoscapes revealed strong spatial patterns in δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C with pronounced species-specific differences, demonstrating distinct spatial ranges of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions. A coniferous tree and an ericaceous dwarf shrub showed significant enrichment in δ<sup>15</sup>N within a range of 5–8 m surrounding the canopy of <i>A. longifolia</i>, indicating input of N originating from symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation by the invader. In the dwarf shrub, which was most responsive to invader influence, enrichment in δ<sup>13</sup>C additionally demonstrated spatially explicit changes to WUE<sub>i</sub>, while a native N<sub>2</sub>-fixer was unresponsive to the presence of the invader. Furthermore, δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes yielded different patterns, indicating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions can have distinct spatial distributions and ranges based on the process measured. Additionally, the magnitude of the effect differed between field situations with high and low invasion pressure. This study highlights that the spatial scale must be accounted for when assessing the effects and outcome of species interactions. Functional tracers such as stable isotopes enable us to quantify spatial ranges of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions, providing empirical data that can help to better understand and predict complex species interactions in multifaceted natural environments.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s outperformed wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with respect to growth, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> production in Arabidopsis, including in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p>Metal accumulation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s is a prerequisite for germination and establishment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate metal transport processes and their interactions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, we focused on METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast transporter of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> stores of Mn, required for efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 transports Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe transport function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe transport. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s in the presence of Mn or subjecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During germination, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s depends on MTP8 and that this transporter plays an important role in the generation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> metal stores as well as for metal homeostasis and germination efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

A Specialized Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase Contributes to the Extreme Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Content of <i>Cuphea</i> Seed Oil
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oils of many <i>Cuphea</i> sp. contain >90% of medium-chain fatty acids, such as decanoic acid (10:0). These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oils, which are among the most compositionally variant in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> kingdom, arise from specialized fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes and specialized acyltransferases. These include lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylation of medium-chain fatty acids in the <i>sn</i>-2 and <i>sn</i>-3 positions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identification of a cDNA for a DGAT1-type enzyme, designated CpuDGAT1, from the transcriptome of <i>C. avigera</i> var <i>pulcherrima</i> developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. Microsomes of camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s engineered for CpuDGAT1 expression displayed DGAT activity with 10:0-CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4-fold higher than that in camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> microsomes lacking CpuDGAT1. In addition, coexpression in camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of CpuDGAT1 with a <i>C. viscosissima</i> FatB thioesterase (CvFatB1) that generates 10:0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10:0. More strikingly, expression of CpuDGAT1 and CvFatB1 with the previously described CvLPAT2, a 10:0-CoA-specific <i>Cuphea</i> LPAT, increased 10:0 amounts to 25 mol % in camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> TAG. These TAGs contained up to 40 mol % 10:0 in the <i>sn</i>-2 position, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpression of CvFatB1 and CvLPAT2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10:0 was not detected in phosphatidylcholine in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10:0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these enzymes to generate 10:0-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oils.</p>

Awake1, an ABC-Type Transporter, Reveals an Essential Role for Suberin in the Control of Seed Dormancy
<p>The mother <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> plays an important dynamic role in the control of dormancy of her progeny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> in response to environmental signals. In order to further understand the mechanisms by which this dormancy control takes place in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we conducted a forward genetic screen to isolate mutants that fail to enter dormancy in response to variation in temperature during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> set. We show that, for the first of these mutants, designated <i>awake1</i>, the maternal allele is required for entry into strongly dormant states and that <i>awake1</i> mutants show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> phenotypes shown previously to be associated with the loss of suberin in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. We identify <i>awake1</i> as an allele of <i>ABCG20</i>, an ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding gene required for the transport of fatty acids during suberin deposition, and show that further suberin-deficient mutants have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy defects. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat suberin composition is affected by temperature during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> maturation, but this response appears to be independent of ABCG20. We conclude that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat suberin is essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy imposition by low temperature and that the exclusion of oxygen and water from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> by the suberin and tannin layers is important for dormancy imposition.</p>

MYB89 Transcription Factor Represses Seed Oil Accumulation
<p>In many higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation is precisely controlled by intricate multilevel regulatory networks, among which transcriptional regulation mainly influences oil biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the master positive transcription factors, <i>WRINKLED1</i> (<i>WRI1</i>) and <i>LEAFY COTYLEDON1-LIKE</i> (<i>L1L</i>), are important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation. We found that an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, MYB89, was expressed predominantly in developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s during maturation. Oil and major fatty acid biosynthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s was significantly promoted by <i>myb89-1</i> mutation and <i>MYB89</i> knockdown; thus, MYB89 was an important repressor during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation. RNA sequencing revealed remarkable up-regulation of numerous genes involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation in <i>myb89</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s at 12 d after pollination. Posttranslational activation of a MYB89-glucocorticoid receptor fusion protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that MYB89 inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation by directly repressing <i>WRI1</i> and five key genes and by indirectly suppressing <i>L1L</i> and 11 key genes involved in oil biosynthesis during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> maturation. These results help us to understand the novel function of MYB89 and provide new insights into the regulatory network of transcriptional factors controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation in Arabidopsis.</p>

Giberellic Acid-Stimulated Transcript Proteins Evolved through Successive Conjugation of Novel Motifs and Their Subfunctionalization
<p><i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript</i> (<i>GAST</i>)-like genes encode small polypeptides, some of which have been implicated in diverse biological processes regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development. However, the occurrence of GASTs among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, their protein structures, and the mechanisms by which they evolved remain elusive. Here, using a customized workflow, we report genes encoding GAST proteins, identify novel motifs and evolutionary patterns contributing to the subfunctionalization of GAST domains, and explore functional conservation across diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> groups. We show that <i>GAST</i>-like sequences evolved initially in the vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i>, after the divergence from bryophytes, and later emerged in gymnosperms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiosperm</span></strong>s. GASTs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiosperm</span></strong>s are characterized by four conserved novel motifs; however, relatively fewer conserved motifs exist in pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GAST-Cysteine Rich1 motif evolved early in the <i>S. moellendorffii</i> GAST, which further acquired subfunctionalization through successive conjugation of other motifs and remained conserved across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, as supported by their collinearity. Functional characterization of two orthologs from the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated Arabidopsis 10</i>) and the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-Related 9</i>) suggests hormonal regulation, novel roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> germination, and functional conservation among diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> groups. Computational modeling predicts that these <i>GAST</i> genes are regulated by several factors, including the phytohormones gibberellin and abscisic acid, through conserved cis-motifs present in their promoters, and that they might act as signaling molecules in a complex feedback loop. Thus, our study identifies <i>GAST</i>s and their encoded proteins, uncovers their structure, novel motifs, and evolutionary pattern among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, and suggests their functional conservation.</p>

<i>Trichoderma</i> Histone Deacetylase HDA-2 Modulates Multiple Responses in Arabidopsis
<p><i>Trichoderma</i> spp. are a rich source of secondary metabolites and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which may induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses and modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth. In filamentous fungi, chromatin modifications regulate secondary metabolism. In this study we investigated how the absence of histone deacetylase HDA-2 in the <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> strain Δ<i>hda-2</i> impacts its effect on a host, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The production of VOCs and their impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development were assessed as well. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> strain was impaired in its ability to colonize Arabidopsis roots, thus affecting the promotion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and modulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses against foliar pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, which normally result from interaction with <i>T. atroviride</i>. Furthermore, Δ<i>hda-2</i> VOCs were incapable of triggering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses to counterattack foliar pathogens. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> overproduced the VOC 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP), which resulted in enhanced root branching and differentially regulated phytohormone-related genes. Analysis of ten VOCs (including 6-PP) revealed that three of them positively regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, whereas six had the opposite effect. Assessment of secondary metabolites, detoxification, and communication with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-related genes showed a dual role for HDA-2 in <i>T. atroviride</i> gene expression regulation during its interaction with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 on the promoters of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-responsive genes in Δ<i>hda-2</i> showed, in the presence of Arabidopsis, low levels of <i>epl-1</i> and <i>abc-2</i> compared with that in the wild type; whereas <i>ctf-1</i> presented high constitutive levels, supporting a dual role of HDA-2 in gene regulation. This work highlights the importance of HDA-2 as a global regulator in <i>Trichoderma</i> to modulate multiple responses in Arabidopsis.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis modeling. However, the construction of accurate 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> models is challenging, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-based method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, tuning camera placement to match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> types.</p>

Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols, and esters, are formed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense at wound sites, indirect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense via the attraction of herbivore predators, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduction of C6-aldehydes into C6-alcohols is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde reduction remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-alcohol production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore infestation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which corresponded with reduced C6-alcohol levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered photosystem II activity. Our study shows that reductases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding toxicity from volatile carbonyls and in the attraction of herbivore predators.</p>

<i>MYB52</i> Negatively Regulates Pectin Demethylesterification in Seed Coat Mucilage
<p>Pectin, which is a major component of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> primary cell walls, is synthesized and methyl-esterified in the Golgi apparatus and then demethylesterified by pectin methylesterases (PMEs) located in the cell wall. The degree of methylesterification affects the functional properties of pectin, and thereby influences <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, development and defense. However, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate pectin demethylesterification. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage, the absence of the <i>MYB52</i> transcription factor is correlated with an increase in PME activity and a decrease in the degree of pectin methylesterification. Decreased methylesterification in the <i>myb52</i> mutant is also correlated with an increase in the calcium content of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> mucilage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and molecular genetic studies suggest that <i>MYB52</i> transcriptionally activates <i>PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR6</i> (<i>PMEI6</i>), <i>PMEI14</i>, and <i>SUBTILISIN-LIKE SER PROTEASE1.7</i> (<i>SBT1.7</i>) by binding to their promoters. <i>PMEI6</i> and <i>SBT1.7</i> have previously been shown to be involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage demethylesterification. Our characterization of two <i>PMEI14</i> mutants suggests that PMEI14 has a role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage demethylesterification, although its activity may be confined to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat in contrast to PMEI6, which functions in the whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. Our demonstration that <i>MYB52</i> negatively regulates pectin demethylesterification in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage, and the identification of components of the molecular network involved, provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism controlling pectin demethylesterification and increases our understanding of the transcriptional regulation network involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat mucilage formation.</p>

Arabidopsis <i>LORELEI</i>, a Maternally Expressed Imprinted Gene, Promotes Early Seed Development
<p>In flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, the female gametophyte controls pollen tube reception immediately before fertilization and regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development immediately after fertilization, although the controlling mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we showed that <i>LORELEI</i> (<i>LRE</i>), which encodes a putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein, is critical for pollen tube reception by the female gametophyte before fertilization and the initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development after fertilization. Here, we show that <i>LRE</i> is expressed in the synergid, egg, and central cells of the female gametophyte and in the zygote and proliferating endosperm of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. Interestingly, <i>LRE</i> expression in the developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s was primarily from the matrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele, indicating that <i>LRE</i> expression is imprinted. However, <i>LRE</i> was biallelically expressed in 8-d-old <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings, indicating that the patrigenic allele does not remain silenced throughout the sporophytic generation. Regulation of imprinted <i>LRE</i> expression is likely novel, as <i>LRE</i> was not expressed in pollen or pollen tubes of mutants defective for MET1, DDM1, RNA-dependent DNA methylation, or MSI-dependent histone methylation. Additionally, the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele inherited from these mutants was not expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. Surprisingly, and contrary to the predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis, LRE promotes growth in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, as loss of the matrigenic but not the patrigenic <i>LRE</i> allele caused delayed initiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development. Our results showed that <i>LRE</i> is a rare imprinted gene that functions immediately after double fertilization and supported the model that a passage through the female gametophyte establishes monoalleleic expression of <i>LRE</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and controls early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development.</p>

The olfactory neuron AWC promotes avoidance of normally palatable food following chronic dietary restriction
<p>Changes in metabolic state alter foraging behavior and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference in animals. Here, I show that normally attractive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> becomes repulsive to <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> if animals are chronically undernourished as a result of alimentary tract defects. This behavioral plasticity is achieved in two ways: increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> leaving and induction of aversive behavior towards <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>. A particularly strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoider is defective in the chitin synthase that makes the pharyngeal lining. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance induced by underfeeding is mediated by cGMP signaling in the olfactory neurons AWC and AWB, and the gustatory neurons ASJ and ASK. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance is enhanced by increased population density and is reduced if the animals are unable to correctly interpret their nutritional state as a result of defects in the AMP kinase or TOR/S6kinase pathways. The TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway suppresses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance and the cellular basis for this is distinct from its role in aversive olfactory learning of harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>. This study suggests that nutritional state feedback via nutrient sensors, population size and olfactory neurons guides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

A Group D MAPK Protects Plants from Autotoxicity by Suppressing Herbivore-Induced Defense Signaling
<p>The mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s activate and enhance defense responses have been well studied; however, the regulatory mechanisms that allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to avoid excessive defense responses are poorly understood. Here, we identified a group D mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>OsMAPK20-5</i>, whose expression was rapidly induced by infestation of gravid female adults of a destructive rice pest, brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>), but not by BPH nymphs. Expression silencing of <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) after gravid female BPH infestation, and thereby increased rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs. However, when exposed to high densities of gravid BPH females, irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s wilted earlier than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which could be attributed to the hyperaccumulation of ethylene and NO in irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Interestingly, when released into the field, irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed broad resistance to BPH and white-backed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (<i>Sogatella furcifera</i>), the two most destructive pests of rice, and produced higher yield. Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers, it also enables rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense-response–related autotoxicity.</p>

Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Together, these observations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s through tandem gene duplication.</p>

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oils to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil content and poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks efficient metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced abundant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more abundant than any other fatty acid in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>. Efficient utilization of hydroxy-containing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-oil phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage lipid available for mobilization during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling development, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to efficiently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified oils in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

The Role of Gβ Protein in Controlling Cell Expansion via Potential Interaction with Lipid Metabolic Pathways
<p>Heterotrimeric G-proteins influence almost all aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, likely via their interaction with specific effectors. However, the identity of such effectors and their mechanism of action are mostly unknown. While investigating the roles of different G-protein subunits in modulating the oil content in Camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>), an oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> crop, we uncovered a role of Gβ proteins in controlling anisotropic cell expansion. Knockdown of <i>Gβ</i> genes causes reduced longitudinal and enhanced transverse expansion, resulting in altered cell, tissue, and organ shapes in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s during vegetative and reproductive development. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also exhibited substantial changes in their fatty acid and phospholipid profiles, which possibly leads to the increased oil content of the transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. This increase is potentially caused by the direct interaction of Gβ proteins with a specific patatin-like phospholipase, pPLAIIIδ. Camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with suppressed <i>Gβ</i> expression exhibit higher lipase activity, and show phenotypes similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing <i>pPLAIIIδ</i>, suggesting that the Gβ proteins are negative regulators of pPLAIIIδ. These results reveal interactions between the G-protein–mediated and lipid signaling/metabolic pathways, where specific phospholipases may act as effectors that control key developmental and environmental responses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone signaling in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the formation of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the formation of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced formation of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Moreover, exogenous application of BR enhanced chlorophyll content and autophagosome formation and decreased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins under nitrogen starvation. Leaf chlorosis and chlorophyll degradation were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under nitrogen starvation. Meanwhile, nitrogen starvation-induced expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation were compromised in both <i>BZR1</i>-silenced and <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s but were increased in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Taken together, our results suggest that BZR1-dependent BR signaling up-regulates the expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation, which plays a critical role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> response to nitrogen starvation in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>).</p>

MicroRNA166 Modulates Cadmium Tolerance and Accumulation in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20- to 24-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> miRNAs, such as miR166, have vital roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, development and responses to environmental stresses. One such environmental stress encountered by crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s is exposure to cadmium (Cd), an element highly toxic to most organisms, including humans and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In this study, we analyzed the role of miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The expression levels of miR166 in both root and leaf tissues were significantly higher in the reproductive stage than in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ling stage in rice. The expression of miR166 in the roots of rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lings was reduced after Cd treatment. Overexpression of miR166 in rice improved Cd tolerance, a result associated with the reduction of Cd-induced oxidative stress in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Furthermore, overexpression of miR166 reduced both Cd translocation from roots to shoots and Cd accumulation in the grains. miR166 targets genes encoding the class-III homeodomain-Leu zipper (HD-Zip) family proteins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In rice, <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>) gene (Os03g43930), which encodes an HD-Zip protein, was up-regulated by Cd treatment but down-regulated by overexpression of miR166 in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Overexpression of <i>OsHB4</i> increased Cd sensitivity and Cd accumulation in the leaves and grains of transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. By contrast, silencing <i>OsHB4</i> by RNA interference enhanced Cd tolerance in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. These results indicate a critical role for miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance through regulation of its target gene, <i>OsHB4</i>, in rice.</p>

The Major Origin of Seedless Grapes Is Associated with a Missense Mutation in the MADS-Box Gene <i>VviAGL11</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lessness is greatly prized by consumers of fresh grapes. While stenospermocarpic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> abortion determined by the <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> DEVELOPMENT INHIBITOR</i> (<i>SDI</i>) locus is the usual source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lessness in commercial grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) cultivars, the underlying <i>sdi</i> mutation remains unknown. Here, we undertook an integrative approach to identify the causal mutation. Quantitative genetics and fine-mapping in two ‘Crimson <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>less’-derived F1 mapping populations confirmed the major effect of the <i>SDI</i> locus and delimited the <i>sdi</i> mutation to a 323-kb region on chromosome 18. RNA-sequencing comparing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> traces of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>less and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ed F1 individuals identified processes triggered during <i>sdi</i>-determined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> abortion, including the activation of salicylic acid-dependent autoimmunity. The RNA-sequencing data set was investigated for candidate genes, and while no evidence for causal cis-acting regulatory mutations was detected, deleterious nucleotide changes in coding sequences of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>less haplotype were predicted in two genes within the <i>sdi</i> fine-mapping interval. Targeted resequencing of the two genes in a collection of 124 grapevine cultivars showed that only the point variation causing the arginine-197-to-leucine substitution in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> morphogenesis regulator gene <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE11</i> (<i>VviAGL11</i>) was fully linked with stenospermocarpy. The concurrent postzygotic variation identified for this missense polymorphism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lessness phenotype in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>ed somatic variants of the original stenospermocarpic cultivar supports a causal effect. We postulate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> abortion caused by this amino acid substitution in VviAGL11 is the major cause of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>lessness in cultivated grapevine. This information can be exploited to boost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>less grape breeding.</p>

Out of Water: The Origin and Early Diversification of Plant <i>R</i>-Genes
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-pathogen interactions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s use intracellular proteins with nucleotide-binding site and Leu-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains to detect pathogens. NBS-LRR proteins represent a major class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> disease resistance genes (<i>R</i>-genes). Whereas <i>R</i>-genes have been well characterized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiosperm</span></strong>s, little is known about their origin and early diversification. Here, we perform comprehensive evolutionary analyses of <i>R</i>-genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and report the identification of <i>R</i>-genes in basal-branching streptophytes, including charophytes, liverworts, and mosses. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> <i>R</i>-genes originated in charophytes and R-proteins diversified into TIR-NBS-LRR proteins and non-TIR-NBS-LRR proteins in charophytes. Moreover, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> R-proteins evolved in a modular fashion through frequent gain or loss of protein domains. Most of the <i>R</i>-genes in basal-branching streptophytes underwent adaptive evolution, indicating an ancient involvement of <i>R</i>-genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-pathogen interactions. Our findings provide novel insights into the origin and evolution of <i>R</i>-genes and the mechanisms underlying colonization of terrestrial environments by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture is a key factor affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>ing density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in maize breeding.</p>

KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering is an agronomically important trait. Two major domestication factors are responsible for this: qSH1 and SH5. Whereas qSH1 functions in cell differentiation in the abscission zone (AZ), a major role of SH5 is the repression of lignin deposition. We have determined that a KNOX protein, OSH15, also controls <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering. Knockdown mutations of <i>OSH15</i> showed reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-shattering phenotypes. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OSH15 interacts with SH5 and qSH1, two proteins in the BELL homeobox family. In transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s carrying the <i>OSH15</i> promoter-<i>GUS</i> reporter construct, the reporter gene was preferentially expressed in the AZ during young spikelet development. The RNA in situ hybridization experiment also showed that <i>OSH15</i> messenger RNAs were abundant in the AZ during spikelet development. Analyses of <i>osh15 SH5-</i>D double mutants showed that <i>SH5</i> could not increase the degree of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering when <i>OSH15</i> was absent, indicating that SH5 functions together with OSH15. In addition to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-shattering phenotype, <i>osh15</i> mutants displayed dwarfism and accumulated a higher amount of lignin in internodes due to increased expression of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis. Knockout mutations of <i>CAD2</i>, which encodes an enzyme for the last step in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, caused an easy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-shattering phenotype by reducing lignin deposition in the AZ. This indicated that the lignin level is an important determinant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that both OSH15 and SH5 interact directly with <i>CAD2</i> chromatin. We conclude that OSH15 and SH5 form a dimer that enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> shattering by directly inhibiting lignin biosynthesis genes.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of lipid synthesis in oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s is still not fully understood. Oil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of lipid accumulation in oil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> rape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major lipid species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different lipid compositions between the various tissue types within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the lipid composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> lipid accumulation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> maturity. The spatial patterning of lipid molecular species did not vary significantly during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. The distinct lipid distribution profiles observed imply differential regulation of lipid metabolism between the different tissue types of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oil<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> rape productivity and quality.</p>

Feedback regulation of COOLAIR expression controls seed dormancy and flowering time
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s integrate seasonal signals, including temperature and day length, to optimize the timing of developmental transitions. Seasonal sensing requires the activity of two proteins, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), that control certain developmental transitions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. During reproductive development, the mother <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> uses FLC and FT to modulate progeny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy in response to temperature. We found that for regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy, <i>FLC</i> and <i>FT</i> function in opposite configuration to how those same genes control time to flowering. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy, FT regulates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy through <i>FLC</i> gene expression and regulates chromatin state by activating antisense <i>FLC</i> transcription. Thus, in <i>Arabidopsis</i> the same genes controlled in opposite format regulate flowering time and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> dormancy in response to the temperature changes that characterize seasons.</p>

We designed the Gcorn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> database for the retrieval of information on homology and evolution of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> gene of interest. Amino acid sequences of 73 species (62 land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 sequences, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these sequences, homologous genes were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a gene of interest, a phylogenetic tree, connecting genes with high homology indices, and line charts of the numbers of genes with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous genes, and on a phylogenetic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy.

AM symbiosis improves the phosphorous and nitrogen nutrition of host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s; however, little is known about the role of AM symbiosis in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) nutrition. Here, we report that inoculation with the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> improved tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and K<sup>+</sup> acquisition and that K<sup>+</sup> deficiency has a negative effect on root growth and AM colonization. Based on its homology to a <i>Lotus japonicus</i> AM-induced K<sup>+</sup> transporter, we identified a mycorrhiza-specific tomato K<sup>+</sup> transporter, SlHAK10 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum High-affinity Potassium Transporter10</i>), that was exclusively expressed in arbuscule-containing cells. <i>SlHAK10</i> could restore a yeast K<sup>+</sup> uptake-defective mutant in the low-affinity concentration range. Loss of function of <i>SlHAK10</i> led to a significant decrease in mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake and AM colonization rate under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions but did not affect arbuscule development. Overexpressing <i>SlHAK10</i> from the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the AM-specific <i>Solanum melongena Phosphate Transporter4</i> not only improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and K<sup>+</sup> uptake but also increased AM colonization efficiency and soluble sugar content in roots supplied with low K<sup>+</sup>.

The Tomato Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase SlMPK1 Is as a Negative Regulator of the High-Temperature Stress Response
<p>High-temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development. MAPK cascades play key roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and stress signaling, but their involvement in the HT stress response is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 47-kD MBP-phosphorylated protein (p47-MBPK) activated in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves under HT and identify it as SlMPK1 by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of <i>SlMPK1</i> in transgenic tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s resulted in enhanced tolerance to HT, while overexpression resulted in reduced tolerance. Proteomic analysis identified a set of proteins involved in antioxidant defense that are significantly more abundant in RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s than nontransgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under HT stress. RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also showed changes in membrane lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a serine-proline-rich protein homolog, SlSPRH1, which interacts with SlMPK1 in yeast, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cells, and in vitro. We demonstrate that SlMPK1 can directly phosphorylate SlSPRH1. Furthermore, the serine residue serine-44 of SlSPRH1 is a crucial phosphorylation site in the SlMPK1-mediated antioxidant defense mechanism activated during HT stress. We also demonstrate that heterologous expression of <i>SlSPRH1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) led to a decrease in thermotolerance and lower antioxidant capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that SlMPK1 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance in tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. SlMPK1 acts by regulating antioxidant defense, and its substrate SlSPRH1 is involved in this pathway.</p>

Therefore, we studied the effect of heterologous expression of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>BBX21</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) var Spunta. Three independent <i>AtBBX21-</i>expressing lines and the wild-type control were cultivated under sunlight and at controlled temperatures in a greenhouse. By anatomical, physiological, biochemical, and gene expression analysis, we demonstrated that <i>AtBBX21</i>-expressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were more robust and produced more tubers than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Interestingly, <i>AtBBX21-</i>expressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had higher rates of photosynthesis, with a significant increase in photosynthetic gene expression, and higher stomatal conductance, with increased size of the stomatal opening, without any associated decline in water use efficiency. Furthermore, <i>AtBBX21</i>-expressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had reduced photoinhibition associated with higher production of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds, and higher expression of genes in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. To gain insights into the mechanism of BBX21, we evaluated the molecular, morphological, metabolic, and photosynthetic behavior in adult <i>BBX21-</i>overexpressing Arabidopsis. We conclude that <i>BBX21</i> overexpression improved morphological and physiological attributes, and photosynthetic rates in nonoptimal, high-irradiance conditions, without associated impairment of water use efficiency. These characteristics of BBX21 may be useful for increasing production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong>es, and potentially of other crops.</p>

The MtDMI2-MtPUB2 Negative Feedback Loop Plays a Role in Nodulation Homeostasis
<p>DOES NOT MAKE INFECTION 2 (MtDMI2) is a Leu rich repeat-type receptor kinase required for signal transduction in the <i>Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> symbiosis pathway. However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in nodulation homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulation were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s) exhibited impaired infection threads, fewer nodules, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s transformed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were transformed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer nodules than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitination activity, and their nodulation phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s transformed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative feedback loop of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative feedback loop, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulation of nodulation via MtNIN, plays an important role in nodulation homeostasis.</p>

A Dioxygenase Catalyzes Steroid 16α-Hydroxylation in Steroidal Glycoalkaloid Biosynthesis
<p>Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) are toxic specialized metabolites that are found in the Solanaceae. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) contains the SGAs α-solanine and α-chaconine, while tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) contains α-tomatine, all of which are biosynthesized from cholesterol. However, although two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that catalyze the 22- and 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol have been identified, the 16-hydroxylase remains unknown. Feeding with deuterium-labeled cholesterol indicated that the 16α- and 16β-hydrogen atoms of cholesterol were eliminated to form α-solanine and α-chaconine in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong>, while only the 16α-hydrogen atom was eliminated in α-tomatine biosynthesis, suggesting that a single oxidation at C-16 takes place during tomato SGA biosynthesis while a two-step oxidation occurs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong>. Here, we show that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, designated as 16DOX, is involved in SGA biosynthesis. We found that the transcript of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong> <i>16DOX</i> (<i>St16DOX</i>) was expressed at high levels in the tuber sprouts, where large amounts of SGAs are accumulated. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant St16DOX protein revealed that St16DOX catalyzes the 16α-hydroxylation of hydroxycholesterols and that (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol was the best substrate among the nine compounds tested. <i>St16DOX</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s contained significantly lower levels of SGAs, and a detailed metabolite analysis revealed that they accumulated the glycosides of (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol. Analysis of the tomato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>Sl16DOX</i>) gene gave essentially the same results. These findings clearly indicate that 16DOX is a steroid 16α-hydroxylase that functions in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, <i>St16DOX</i> silencing did not affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong> tuber yield, indicating that <i>16DOX</i> may be a suitable target for controlling toxic SGA levels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">potato</span></strong>.</p>

Fern Stomatal Responses to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> Depend on Species and Growth Conditions
<p>Changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, climate, and air humidity affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> gas exchange that is controlled by stomata, small pores on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> leaves and stems formed by guard cells. Evolution has shaped the morphology and regulatory mechanisms governing stomatal movements to correspond to the needs of various land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> groups over the past 400 million years. Stomata close in response to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> hormone abscisic acid (ABA), elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and reduced air humidity. Whether the active regulatory mechanisms that control stomatal closure in response to these stimuli are present already in mosses, the oldest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> group with stomata, or were acquired more recently in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">angiosperm</span></strong>s remains controversial. It has been suggested that the stomata of the basal vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, such as ferns and lycophytes, close solely hydropassively. On the other hand, active stomatal closure in response to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> was found in several moss, lycophyte, and fern species. Here, we show that the stomata of two temperate fern species respond to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> and that an active mechanism of stomatal regulation in response to reduced air humidity is present in some ferns. Importantly, fern stomatal responses depend on growth conditions. The data indicate that the stomatal behavior of ferns is more complex than anticipated before, and active stomatal regulation is present in some ferns and has possibly been lost in others. Further analysis that takes into account fern species, life history, evolutionary age, and growth conditions is required to gain insight into the evolution of land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> stomatal responses.</p>

Selection for a Zinc-Finger Protein Contributes to Seed Oil Increase during Soybean Domestication
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil is a momentous agronomical trait of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) targeted by domestication in breeding. Although multiple oil-related genes have been uncovered, knowledge of the regulatory mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil biosynthesis is currently limited. We demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>-preferred gene <i>GmZF351</i>, encoding a tandem CCCH zinc finger protein, is selected during domestication. Further analysis shows that <i>GmZF351</i> facilitates oil accumulation by directly activating <i>WRINKLED1</i>, <i>BIOTIN CARBOXYL CARRIER PROTEIN2</i>, <i>3-KETOACYL-ACYL CARRIER PROTEIN SYNTHASE III</i>, <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL O-ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i>, and <i>OLEOSIN2</i> in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. Overexpression of <i>GmZF351</i> in transgenic soybean also activates lipid biosynthesis genes, thereby accelerating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation. The <i>ZF351</i> haplotype from the cultivated soybean group and the wild soybean (<i>Glycine soja</i>) subgroup III correlates well with high gene expression level, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil contents and promoter activity, suggesting that selection of <i>GmZF351</i> expression leads to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil content in cultivated soybean. Our study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> oil accumulation, and the manipulation of <i>GmZF351</i> may have great potential in the improvement of oil production in soybean and other related crops.</p>

A Salivary Endo-β-1,4-Glucanase Acts as an Effector That Enables the Brown Planthopper to Feed on Rice
<p>The brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (BPH) <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> is one of the most destructive insect pests on rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in Asia. After landing on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, BPH rapidly accesses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phloem and sucks the phloem sap through unknown mechanisms. We discovered a salivary endo-β-1,4-glucanase (NlEG1) that has endoglucanase activity with a maximal activity at pH 6 at 37°C and is secreted into rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s by BPH. <i>NlEG1</i> is highly expressed in the salivary glands and midgut. Silencing <i>NlEG1</i> decreases the capacity of BPH to reach the phloem and reduces its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> intake, mass, survival, and fecundity on rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. By contrast, <i>NlEG1</i> silencing had only a small effect on the survival rate of BPH raised on artificial diet. Moreover, NlEG1 secreted by BPH did not elicit the production of the defense-related signal molecules salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in rice, although wounding plus the application of the recombination protein NlEG1 did slightly enhance the levels of jasmonic acid and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with the corresponding controls. These data suggest that NlEG1 enables the BPH’s stylet to reach the phloem by degrading celluloses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cell walls, thereby functioning as an effector that overcomes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cell wall defense in rice.</p>

Network-Guided GWAS Improves Identification of Genes Affecting Free Amino Acids
<p>Amino acids are essential for proper growth and development in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Amino acids serve as building blocks for proteins but also are important for responses to stress and the biosynthesis of numerous essential compounds. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>, the pool of free amino acids (FAAs) also contributes to alternative energy, desiccation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> vigor; thus, manipulating FAA levels can significantly impact a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>’s nutritional qualities. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on branched-chain amino acids have identified some regulatory genes controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> FAAs, the genetic regulation of FAA levels, composition, and homeostasis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s remains mostly unresolved. Hence, we performed GWAS on 18 FAAs from a 313-ecotype Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) association panel. Specifically, GWAS was performed on 98 traits derived from known amino acid metabolic pathways (approach 1) and then on 92 traits generated from an unbiased correlation-based metabolic network analysis (approach 2), and the results were compared. The latter approach facilitated the discovery of additional novel metabolic interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations not identified by the former approach. The most prominent network-guided GWAS signal was for a histidine (His)-related trait in a region containing two genes: a cationic amino acid transporter (CAT4) and a polynucleotide phosphorylase resistant to inhibition with fosmidomycin. A reverse genetics approach confirmed CAT4 to be responsible for the natural variation of His-related traits across the association panel. Given that His is a semiessential amino acid and a potent metal chelator, CAT4 orthologs could be considered as candidate genes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> quality biofortification in crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Sources of Sodium in US Adults From 3 Geographic Regions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US adults consume excess sodium. Knowledge about the dietary sources of sodium intake is critical to the development of effective reduction strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 450 adults were recruited from 3 geographic locations: Birmingham, AL (n=150); Palo Alto, CA (n=150); and the Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN (n=150), metropolitan areas. Equal numbers of women and men from each of 4 race/ethnic groups (blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites) were targeted for recruitment. Four record-assisted 24-hour dietary recalls were collected from each participant with special procedures, which included the collection of duplicate samples of salt added to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> at the table and in home <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Sodium added to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> outside the home was the leading source of sodium, accounting for more than two thirds (70.9%) of total sodium intake in the sample.

SEED CAROTENOID DEFICIENT Functions in Isoprenoid Biosynthesis via the Plastid MEP Pathway
<p>Plastid isoprenoids, a diverse group of compounds that includes carotenoids, chlorophylls, tocopherols, and multiple hormones, are essential for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development. Here, we identified and characterized <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong> CAROTENOID DEFICIENT</i> (<i>SCD</i>), which encodes an enzyme that functions in the biosynthesis of plastid isoprenoids in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). SCD converts 2<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erytrithol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate to 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate in the penultimate step of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. In <i>scd</i> mutants, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development are impaired and the levels of MEP-derived isoprenoids, such as carotenoids, chlorophylls, and tocopherols, as well as abscisic and gibberellic acids, are reduced in leaves and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s. This <i>scd</i> metabolic alteration varies among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues and under different light conditions. RNA-sequencing of the <i>scd</i> mutant and wild type identified a limited number of differentially expressed genes in the MEP pathway, although isoprenoid levels were significantly reduced in <i>scd</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seed</span></strong>s and dark-grown leaves. Furthermore, <i>SCD</i>-overexpressing transgenic lines showed little or no differences in isoprenoid levels, indicating that SCD may be subject to posttranslational regulation or not represent a rate-limiting step in the MEP pathway. These results enhance our understanding of the transcriptomic and metabolic regulatory roles of enzymes in the MEP pathway and of their effects on downstream isoprenoid pathways in various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues and under different light conditions.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s integrate these environmental cues to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation enzyme, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic enzyme, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s integrate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have evolved for growth and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and water use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> water use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance agricultural sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size and water use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-watered and water-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size and water use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size given water use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size, water use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil water availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> WUE under different watering treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer drought resistance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in rice, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under drought stress. The leaves of STTM166 rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified rice <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing a miR166-resistant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, including leaf rolling and higher drought resistance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall formation and vascular development. Our results suggest that drought resistance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

A Mucin-Like Protein of Planthopper Is Required for Feeding and Induces Immunity Response in Plants
<p>The brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>, is a pest that threatens rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide. While feeding on rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers secrete saliva, which plays crucial roles in nutrient ingestion and modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense responses, although the specific functions of salivary proteins remain largely unknown. We identified an <i>N. lugens</i>-secreted mucin-like protein (NlMLP) by transcriptome and proteome analyses and characterized its function, both in brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. <i>NlMLP</i> is highly expressed in salivary glands and is secreted into rice during feeding. Inhibition of <i>NlMLP</i> expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers disturbs the formation of salivary sheaths, thereby reducing their performance. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, NlMLP induces cell death, the expression of defense-related genes, and callose deposition. These defense responses are related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and the MEK2 MAP kinase and jasmonic acid signaling pathways. The active region of NlMLP that elicits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses is located in its carboxyl terminus. Our work provides a detailed characterization of a salivary protein from a piercing-sucking insect other than aphids. Our finding that the protein functions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> immune responses offers new insights into the mechanism underlying interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and herbivorous insects.</p>

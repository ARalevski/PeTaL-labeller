Encoding of vinylidene isomerization in its anion photoelectron spectrum
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vinyliden</span></strong>e-acetylene isomerization is the prototypical example of a 1,2-hydrogen shift, one of the most important classes of isomerization reactions in organic chemistry. This reaction was investigated with quantum state specificity by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vinyliden</span></strong>e anions H<sub>2</sub>CC and D<sub>2</sub>CC and quantum dynamics calculations. Peaks in the photoelectron spectra are considerably narrower than in previous work and reveal subtleties in the isomerization dynamics of neutral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vinyliden</span></strong>e, as well as vibronic coupling with an excited state of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vinyliden</span></strong>e. Comparison with theory permits assignment of most spectral features to eigenstates dominated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vinyliden</span></strong>e character. However, excitation of the ν<sub>6</sub> in-plane rocking mode in H<sub>2</sub>CC results in appreciable tunneling-facilitated mixing with highly vibrationally excited states of acetylene, leading to broadening and/or spectral fine structure that is largely suppressed for analogous vibrational levels of D<sub>2</sub>CC.</p>

Catalytic reductive [4 + 1]-cycloadditions of vinylidenes and dienes
<p>Cycloaddition reactions provide direct and convergent routes to cycloalkanes, making them valuable targets for the development of synthetic methods. Whereas six-membered rings are readily accessible from Diels-Alder reactions, cycloadditions that generate five-membered rings are comparatively limited in scope. Here, we report that dinickel complexes catalyze [4 + 1]-cycloaddition reactions of 1,3-dienes. The C<sub>1</sub> partner is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vinyliden</span></strong>e equivalent generated from the reductive activation of a 1,1-dichloroalkene in the presence of stoichiometric zinc. Intermolecular and intramolecular variants of the reaction are described, and high levels of asymmetric induction are achieved in the intramolecular cycloadditions using a <i>C</i><sub>2</sub>-symmetric chiral ligand that stabilizes a metal-metal bond.</p>

Hierarchically porous polymer coatings for highly efficient passive daytime radiative cooling
<p>Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) involves spontaneously cooling a surface by reflecting sunlight and radiating heat to the cold outer space. Current PDRC designs are promising alternatives to electrical cooling but are either inefficient or have limited applicability. We present a simple, inexpensive, and scalable phase inversion–based method for fabricating hierarchically porous poly(<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vinyliden</span></strong>e fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) [P(VdF-HFP)<sub>HP</sub>] coatings with excellent PDRC capability. High, substrate-independent hemispherical solar reflectances (0.96 ± 0.03) and long-wave infrared emittances (0.97 ± 0.02) allow for subambient temperature drops of ~6°C and cooling powers of ~96 watts per square meter (W m<sup>−2</sup>) under solar intensities of 890 and 750 W m<sup>−2</sup>, respectively. The performance equals or surpasses those of state-of-the-art PDRC designs, and the technique offers a paint-like simplicity.</p>

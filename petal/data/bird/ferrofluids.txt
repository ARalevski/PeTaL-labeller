Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-feeding butterflies.</p>

Fluid-induced aseismic fault slip outpaces pore-fluid migration
<p>Earthquake swarms attributed to subsurface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> injection are usually assumed to occur on faults destabilized by increased pore-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> pressures. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> injection could also activate aseismic slip, which might outpace pore-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> migration and transmit earthquake-triggering stress changes beyond the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>-pressurized region. We tested this theoretical prediction against data derived from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>-injection experiments that activated and measured slow, aseismic slip on preexisting, shallow faults. We found that the pore pressure and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Using a coupled shear-rupture model, we derived constraints on the hydromechanical parameters of the actively deforming fault. The inferred aseismic rupture front propagates faster and to larger distances than the diffusion of pressurized pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>.</p>

Hybrid molecular-colloidal liquid crystals
<p>Order and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>ity often coexist, with examples ranging from biological membranes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> crystals, but the symmetry of these soft-matter systems is typically higher than that of the constituent building blocks. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed micrometer-long inorganic colloidal rods in a nematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> crystalline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> of molecular rods. Both types of uniaxial building blocks, while freely diffusing, interact to form an orthorhombic nematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, in which like-sized rods are roughly parallel to each other and the molecular ordering direction is orthogonal to that of colloidal rods. A coarse-grained model explains the experimental temperature-concentration phase diagram with one biaxial and two uniaxial nematic phases, as well as the orientational distributions of rods. Displaying properties of biaxial optical crystals, these hybrid molecular-colloidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s can be switched by electric and magnetic fields.</p>

mRNA structure determines specificity of a polyQ-driven phase separation
<p>RNA promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phase separation (LLPS) to build membraneless compartments in cells. How distinct molecular compositions are established and maintained in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> compartments is unknown. Here, we report that secondary structure allows messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to self-associate and determines whether an mRNA is recruited to or excluded from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> compartments. The polyQ-protein Whi3 induces conformational changes in RNA structure and generates distinct molecular fluctuations depending on the RNA sequence. These data support a model in which structure-based, RNA-RNA interactions promote assembly of distinct droplets and protein-driven, conformational dynamics of the RNA maintain this identity. Thus, the shape of RNA can promote the formation and coexistence of the diverse array of RNA-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> compartments found in a single cell.</p>

Antifreeze proteins in the primary urine of larvae of the beetle <i>Dendroides canadensis</i>
<p>To avoid freezing while overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, <i>Dendroides canadensis</i> (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) larvae produce a family of antifreeze proteins (DAFPs) that are transcribed in specific tissues and have specific compartmental fates. DAFPs and associated thermal hysteresis activity (THA) have been shown previously in hemolymph and midgut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, but the presence of DAFPs has not been explored in primary urine, a potentially important site that can contain endogenous ice-nucleating compounds that could induce freezing. A maximum mean THA of 2.65±0.33°C was observed in primary urine of winter-collected <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae. THA in primary urine increased significantly through autumn, peaked in the winter and decreased through spring to levels of 0.2–0.3°C in summer, in a pattern similar to that of hemolymph and midgut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>. THA was also found in hindgut <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> and excreted rectal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, suggesting that these larvae not only concentrate AFPs in the hindgut, but also excrete AFPs from the rectal cavity. Based on <i>dafp</i> transcripts isolated from Malpighian tubule epithelia, cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, identifying the presence of transcripts encoding 24 DAFP isoforms. Six of these Malpighian tubule DAFPs were known previously, but 18 are new. We also provide functional evidence that DAFPs can inhibit ice nucleators present in insect primary urine. This is potentially critical because <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae die if frozen, and therefore ice formation in any body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, including the urine, would be lethal.</p>

Microtubules tune mechanotransduction through NOX2 and TRPV4 to decrease sclerostin abundance in osteocytes
<p>The adaptation of the skeleton to its mechanical environment is orchestrated by mechanosensitive osteocytes, largely by regulating the abundance of sclerostin, a secreted inhibitor of bone formation. We defined a microtubule-dependent mechanotransduction pathway that linked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signals that led to a reduction in sclerostin abundance in cultured osteocytes. We demonstrated that microtubules stabilized by detyrosination, a reversible posttranslational modification of polymerized α-tubulin, determined the stiffness of the cytoskeleton, which set the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress. We showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress through the microtubule network activated NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2)–generated ROS that target the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel TRPV4 to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Furthermore, tuning the abundance of detyrosinated tubulin affected cytoskeletal stiffness to define the mechanoresponsive range of cultured osteocytes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> shear stress. Finally, we demonstrated that NOX2-ROS elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that activated the kinase CaMKII to decrease the abundance of sclerostin protein. Together, these discoveries may identify potentially druggable targets for regulating osteocyte mechanotransduction to affect bone quality.</p>

A liquid phase of synapsin and lipid vesicles
<p>Neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles (SVs) form tight clusters at synapses. These clusters act as a reservoir from which SVs are drawn for exocytosis during sustained activity. Several components associated with SVs that are likely to help form such clusters have been reported, including synapsin. Here we found that synapsin can form a distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phase in an aqueous environment. Other scaffolding proteins could coassemble into this condensate but were not necessary for its formation. Importantly, the synapsin phase could capture small lipid vesicles. The synapsin phase rapidly disassembled upon phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, mimicking the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion of synapsin 1 that occurs at presynaptic sites upon stimulation. Thus, principles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phase separation may apply to the clustering of SVs at synapses.</p>

Wrapping with a splash: High-speed encapsulation with ultrathin sheets
<p>Many complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s rely on surfactants to contain, protect, or isolate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> drops in an immiscible continuous phase. Thin elastic sheets can wrap <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> drops in a spontaneous process driven by capillary forces. For encapsulation by sheets to be practically viable, a rapid, continuous, and scalable process is essential. We exploit the fast dynamics of droplet impact to achieve wrapping of oil droplets by ultrathin polymer films in a water phase. Despite the violence of splashing events, the process robustly yields wrappings that are optimally shaped to maximize the enclosed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> volume and have near-perfect seams. We achieve wrappings of targeted three-dimensional (3D) shapes by tailoring the 2D boundary of the films and show the generality of the technique by producing both oil-in-water and water-in-oil wrappings.</p>

The turbulent cascade in five dimensions
<p>To the naked eye, turbulent flows exhibit whirls of many different sizes. To each size, or scale, corresponds a fraction of the total energy resulting from a cascade in five dimensions: scale, time, and three-dimensional space. Understanding this process is critical to strategies for modeling geophysical and industrial flows. By tracking the flow regions containing energy in different scales, we have detected the statistical predominance of a cross-scale link whereby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> lumps of energy at scale Δ appear within lumps of scale 2Δ and die within those of scale Δ/2. Our approach uncovers the energy cascade in a simple water-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, offering insights for turbulence models while paving the way for similar analyses in conducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s, quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s, and plasmas.</p>

Complete measurement of helicity and its dynamics in vortex tubes
<p>Helicity, a topological measure of the intertwining of vortices in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> flow, is a conserved quantity in inviscid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s but can be dissipated by viscosity in real flows. Despite its relevance across a range of flows, helicity in real <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s remains poorly understood because the entire quantity is challenging to measure. We measured the total helicity of thin-core vortex tubes in water. For helical vortices that are stretched or compressed by a second vortex, we found conservation of total helicity. For an isolated helical vortex, we observed evolution toward and maintenance of a constant helicity state after the dissipation of twist helicity by viscosity. Our results show that helicity can remain constant even in a viscous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> and provide an improved basis for understanding and manipulating helicity in real flows.</p>

Transition from turbulent to coherent flows in confined three-dimensional active fluids
<p>Transport of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> through a pipe is essential for the operation of macroscale machines and micro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>ic devices. Conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s only flow in response to external pressure. We demonstrate that an active isotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>, composed of microtubules and molecular motors, autonomously flows through meter-long three-dimensional channels. We establish control over the magnitude, velocity profile, and direction of the self-organized flows and correlate these to the structure of the extensile microtubule bundles. The inherently three-dimensional transition from bulk-turbulent to confined-coherent flows occurs concomitantly with a transition in the bundle orientational order near the surface and is controlled by a scale-invariant criterion related to the channel profile. The nonequilibrium transition of confined isotropic active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>s can be used to engineer self-organized soft machines.</p>

Templated nanofiber synthesis via chemical vapor polymerization into liquid crystalline films
<p>Extrusion, electrospinning, and microdrawing are widely used to create fibrous polymer mats, but these approaches offer limited access to oriented arrays of nanometer-scale fibers with controlled size, shape, and lateral organization. We show that chemical vapor polymerization can be performed on surfaces coated with thin films of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> crystals to synthesize organized assemblies of end-attached polymer nanofibers. The process uses low concentrations of radical monomers formed initially in the vapor phase and then diffused into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-crystal template. This minimizes monomer-induced changes to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-crystal phase and enables access to nanofiber arrays with complex yet precisely defined structures and compositions. The nanofiber arrays permit tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, including adhesion that depends on nanofiber chirality.</p>

Insulator-metal transition in dense fluid deuterium

Anomalously bright subsurface reflections are evident within a well-defined, 20-kilometer-wide zone centered at 193°E, 81°S, which is surrounded by much less reflective areas. Quantitative analysis of the radar signals shows that this bright feature has high relative dielectric permittivity (>15), matching that of water-bearing materials.

Quantum liquid droplets in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates
<p>Quantum droplets are small clusters of atoms self-bound by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces.

We demonstrate that they are several orders of magnitude more dilute than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> helium by directly measuring their size and density via in situ imaging. We show that the droplets are stablized against collapse by quantum fluctuations and that they require a minimum atom number to be stable. Below that number, quantum pressure drives a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-to-gas transition that we map out as a function of interaction strength.

A liquid metal reaction environment for the room-temperature synthesis of atomically thin metal oxides
<p>Two-dimensional (2D) oxides have a wide variety of applications in electronics and other technologies. However, many oxides are not easy to synthesize as 2D materials through conventional methods. We used nontoxic eutectic gallium-based alloys as a reaction solvent and co-alloyed desired metals into the melt. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, we predicted the composition of the self-limiting interfacial oxide. We isolated the surface oxide as a 2D layer, either on substrates or in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suspens</span></strong>ion. This enabled us to produce extremely thin subnanometer layers of HfO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.

Bloch oscillations in the absence of a lattice
<p>The interplay of strong quantum correlations and far-from-equilibrium conditions can give rise to striking dynamical phenomena. We experimentally investigated the quantum motion of an impurity atom immersed in a strongly interacting one-dimensional Bose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> and subject to an external force. We found that the momentum distribution of the impurity exhibits characteristic Bragg reflections at the edge of an emergent Brillouin zone. Although Bragg reflections are typically associated with lattice structures, in our strongly correlated quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> they result from the interplay of short-range crystalline order and kinematic constraints on the many-body scattering processes in the one-dimensional system. As a consequence, the impurity exhibits periodic dynamics, reminiscent of Bloch oscillations, although the quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> is translationally invariant.

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision   arthroplasty surgery. Proprietary cement preparations containing   vancomycin are available, but are significantly more expensive.   We investigated whether the elution of antibiotic from ‘home-made’   cement containing vancomycin was comparable with more expensive   commercially available vancomycin impregnated cement.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 18 cement discs containing either proprietary CopalG+V;   or ‘home-made’ CopalR+G with vancomycin added by hand, were made.   Each disc contained the same amount of antibiotic (0.5 g gentamycin,   2 g vancomycin) and was immersed in ammonium acetate buffer in a   sealed container. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> from each container was sampled at eight   time points over a two-week period.

The overall elution of antibiotic was, fivefold (vancomycin)   and twofold (gentamicin) greater from the ‘home-made’ mix compared   with the commercially mixed cement.

Nematic-to-columnar mesophase transition by in situ supramolecular polymerization
<p>Disk- and rod-shaped molecules are incompatible in coassembly, as the former tend to stack one-dimensionally whereas the latter tend to align in parallel. Because this type of incompatibility can be more pronounced in condensed phases, different-shaped molecules generally exclude one another. We report that supramolecular polymerization of a disk-shaped chiral monomer in nematic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> crystals comprising rod-shaped molecules results in order-increasing mesophase transition into a single mesophase with a core-shell columnar geometry. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> crystalline material responds quickly to an applied electric field, resulting in unidirectional columnar ordering. Moreover, it can be modularly customized to be optoelectrically responsive simply by using a photoisomerizable rod-shaped module. The modular strategy allows for cooperative integration of different functions into elaborate dynamic architectures.</p>

Wafer-scale single-crystal hexagonal boron nitride film via self-collimated grain formation
<p>Although polycrystalline hexagonal boron nitride (PC-hBN) has been realized, defects and grain boundaries still cause charge scatterings and trap sites, impeding high-performance electronics. Here, we report a method of synthesizing wafer-scale single-crystalline hBN (SC-hBN) monolayer films by chemical vapor deposition. The limited solubility of boron (B) and nitrogen (N) atoms in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> gold promotes high diffusion of adatoms on the surface of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> at high temperature to provoke the circular hBN grains. These further evolve into closely packed unimodal grains by means of self-collimation of B and N edges inherited by electrostatic interaction between grains, eventually forming an SC-hBN film on a wafer scale. This SC-hBN film also allows for the synthesis of wafer-scale graphene/hBN heterostructure and single-crystalline tungsten disulfide.</p>

Heterogeneous to homogeneous melting transition visualized with ultrafast electron diffraction
<p>The ultrafast laser excitation of matters leads to nonequilibrium states with complex solid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> phase-transition dynamics. We used electron diffraction at mega–electron volt energies to visualize the ultrafast melting of gold on the atomic scale length. For energy densities approaching the irreversible melting regime, we first observed heterogeneous melting on time scales of 100 to 1000 picoseconds, transitioning to homogeneous melting that occurs catastrophically within 10 to 20 picoseconds at higher energy densities. We showed evidence for the heterogeneous coexistence of solid and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>. We determined the ion and electron temperature evolution and found superheated conditions. Our results constrain the electron-ion coupling rate, determine the Debye temperature, and reveal the melting sensitivity to nucleation seeds.</p>

Capillarity-induced folds fuel extreme shape changes in thin wicked membranes
<p>Soft deformable materials are needed for applications such as stretchable electronics, smart textiles, or soft biomedical devices. However, the design of a durable, cost-effective, or biologically compatible version of such a material remains challenging. Living animal cells routinely cope with extreme deformations by unfolding preformed membrane reservoirs available in the form of microvilli or membrane folds. We synthetically mimicked this behavior by creating nanofibrous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-infused tissues that spontaneously form similar reservoirs through capillarity-induced folding. By understanding the physics of membrane buckling within the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> film, we developed proof-of-concept conformable chemical surface treatments and stretchable basic electronic circuits.</p>

Ice-VII inclusions in diamonds: Evidence for aqueous fluid in Earth’s deep mantle
<p>Water-rich regions in Earth’s deeper mantle are suspected to play a key role in the global water budget and the mobility of heat-generating elements.

Ice-VII, the residue of aqueous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> present during growth of diamond, crystallizes upon ascent of the host diamonds but remains at pressures as high as 24 gigapascals; it is now recognized as a mineral by the International Mineralogical Association.

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase transition between two supercooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> states, but so far this phase transition has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase transition between two homogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp transition in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

The earliest modern humans outside Africa

A maxilla and associated dentition recently discovered at Misliya Cave, Israel, was dated to 177,000 to 194,000 years ago, suggesting that members of the <i>Homo sapiens</i> clade left Africa earlier than previously thought. This finding changes our view on modern human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al and is consistent with recent genetic studies, which have posited the possibility of an earlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al of <i>Homo sapiens</i> around 220,000 years ago.

Cell cycle proteins moonlight in multiciliogenesis

Despite their importance to human health, the pathways controlling the production of motile cilia in differentiating MCCs remain poorly understood.

Most of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al occurred on nonbiodegradable objects, resulting in the longest documented transoceanic survival and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al of coastal species by rafting.

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid
<p>Charge ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which electrons in solids crystallize into a periodic pattern of charge-rich and charge-poor sites owing to strong electron correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In geometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy electronic state without long-range CO has been observed. We found that a charge-ordered organic material with an isosceles triangular lattice shows charge dynamics associated with crystallization and vitrification of electrons, which can be understood in the context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO patterns. The dynamics suggest that the same nucleation and growth processes that characterize conventional glass-forming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>s guide the crystallization of electrons. These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong>-glass transition.</p>

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

On the basis of a low Faraday rotation (12.0 ± 0.7 radians per square meter), we infer negligible magnetization in the circum-burst plasma and constrain the net magnetization of the cosmic web along this sightline to <21 nanogauss, parallel to the line-of-sight.

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p>Lipid oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized lipids has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized lipids (glycerides, fatty acids, phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and galactolipids) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized lipids. Lipid contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized lipids with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of lipids into the fragmentation of oxidized lipids. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized lipids by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized lipids. Analysis of 15-year aged wheat seeds revealed increased lipid oxidation and hydrolysis in seeds stored in ambient versus cold conditions.</p>

Crude dissection of the seed followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of polar metabolites also revealed that many compounds were highly sequestered among the various seed tissue types. To further localize compounds, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging was utilized to visualize compounds in fine detail in their native environments over the course of germination. Most notably, the fatty acyl chain-dependent differential localization of phospholipids and triacylglycerols was observed within the embryo and radicle, showing correlation with the heterogeneous distribution of fatty acids. Other interesting observations include unusual localization of ceramides on the endosperm/scutellum boundary and subcellular localization of ferulate in the aleurone.</p>

Primary Metabolism during Biosynthesis of Secondary Wall Polymers of Protoxylem Vessel Elements
<p>Xylem vessels, the water-conducting cells in vascular plants, undergo characteristic secondary wall deposition and programmed cell death.

Here, to identify changes in metabolism that occur during protoxylem vessel element differentiation, we subjected tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) BY-2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">suspens</span></strong>ion culture cells carrying an inducible <i>VND7</i> system to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">liquid</span></strong> chromatography-mass spectrometry-based wide-target metabolome analysis and transcriptome analysis. Time-course data for 128 metabolites showed dynamic changes in metabolites related to amino acid biosynthesis. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, an important intermediate of the glycolysis pathway, immediately decreased in the initial stages of cell differentiation. As cell differentiation progressed, specific amino acids accumulated, including the shikimate-related amino acids and the translocatable nitrogen-rich amino acid arginine. Transcriptome data indicated that cell differentiation involved the active up-regulation of genes encoding the enzymes catalyzing fructose 6-phosphate biosynthesis from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate biosynthesis from oxaloacetate, and phenylalanine biosynthesis, which includes shikimate pathway enzymes. Concomitantly, active changes in the amount of fructose 6-phosphate and phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate were detected during cell differentiation. Taken together, our results show that protoxylem vessel element differentiation is associated with changes in primary metabolism, which could facilitate the production of polysaccharides and lignin monomers and, thus, promote the formation of the secondary cell wall. Also, these metabolic shifts correlate with the active transcriptional regulation of specific enzyme genes. Therefore, our observations indicate that primary metabolism is actively regulated during protoxylem vessel element differentiation to alter the cell’s metabolic activity for the biosynthesis of secondary wall polymers.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Molecular Characterization and Evolution of a Gene Family Encoding Both Female- and Male-Specific Reproductive Proteins in <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Gene duplication is an important mechanism for the evolution of new reproductive proteins. However, in most cases, each resulting paralog continues to function within the same sex. To investigate the possibility that seminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> proteins arise through duplicates of female reproductive genes that become “co-opted” by males, we screened female reproductive genes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> for cases of duplication in which one of the resulting paralogs produces a protein in males that is transferred to females during mating. We identified a set of three tandemly duplicated genes that encode secreted serine-type endopeptidase homologs, two of which are expressed primarily in the female reproductive tract (RT), whereas the third is expressed specifically in the male RT and encodes a seminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> protein. Evolutionary and gene expression analyses across <i>Drosophila</i> species suggest that this family arose from a single-copy gene that was female-specific; after duplication, one paralog evolved male-specific expression. Functional tests of knockdowns of each gene in <i>D. melanogaster</i> show that one female-expressed gene is essential for full fecundity, and both female-expressed genes contribute singly or in combination to a female’s propensity to remate. In contrast, knockdown of the male-expressed paralog had no significant effect on female fecundity or remating. These data are consistent with a model in which members of this gene family exert effects on females by acting on a common, female-expressed target. After duplication and male co-option of one paralog, the evolution of the interacting proteins could have resulted in differential strengths or effects of each paralog.</p>

Synovial calprotectin
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>Recently, several synovial biomarkers have been introduced into   the algorithm for the diagnosis of a prosthetic joint infection   (PJI). Alpha defensin is a promising biomarker, with a high sensitivity   and specificity, but it is expensive. Calprotectin is a protein   that is present in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, is released upon   neutrophil activation and exhibits anti-microbial activity. Our   aim, in this study, was to determine the diagnostic potential of   synovial calprotectin in the diagnosis of a PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In this pilot study, we prospectively collected synovial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong>   from the hip, knee, shoulder and elbow of 19 patients with a proven   PJI and from a control group of 42 patients who underwent revision   surgery without a PJI.</p><p>PJI was diagnosed according to the current diagnostic criteria   of the Musculoskeletal Infection Society. Synovial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fluid</span></strong> was centrifuged   and the supernatant was used to measure the level of calprotectin   after applying a lateral flow immunoassay. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median synovial calprotectin level was 991 mg/L (interquartile   range (IQR) 154 to 1787) in those with a PJI and 11 mg/L (IQR 3   to 29) in the control group (p < 0.0001). Using a cut-off value   of 50 mg/L, this level showed an excellent diagnostic accuracy,   with an area under the curve of 0.94. The overall sensitivity, specificity,   positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV)   was 89%, 90%, 81% and 95% respectively. The NPV was 97% in the nine   patients with a chronic PJI. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Synovial calprotectin may be a valuable biomarker in the diagnosis   of a PJI, especially in the exclusion of an infection. With a lateral   flow immunoassay, a relatively rapid quantitative diagnosis can   be made. The measurement is cheap and is easy to use. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:660–5.</p></sec>

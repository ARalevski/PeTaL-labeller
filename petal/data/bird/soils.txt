Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> viruses are spread from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted viruses manipulate the release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting virus spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected with these viruses, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and one of its host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Therefore, the frequency of virus acquisition and the virus load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s than on CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of RNAi protein to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

Gall induction may benefit host plant: a case of a gall wasp and eucalyptus tree
<p>Gall-inducing insects display intimate interactions with their host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, usually described as parasitic relationships; the galls seem to favor the galler alone. We report on a case in which the presence of the galls induced by <i>Leptocybe invasa</i> Fisher & LaSalle (Hymenoptera; Eulophidae) benefit its host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, the river red gum <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh. Field observations showed that <i>E. camaldulensis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected by this gall wasp were less susceptible to cold injury than neighboring conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s without galls. In the laboratory, frost resistance was compared between galled and non-galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s which were both divided into two subgroups: cold-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s that were non-acclimated. Galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed higher frost resistance than the non-galled ones, and the differences were higher in non-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with acclimated ones. Physiological changes in host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> were determined by chemical analyses of chlorophylls, proteins, soluble sugars and anthocyanin contents. The results showed higher values of all physiological parameters in the galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of the gall wasp induces physiological changes on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> foliage, which may in turn increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense mechanisms against cold. Therefore, the toll of galling by the herbivore may pay off by the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> acquiring increased frost resistance. This work provides evidence for physiological changes induced by a herbivore which might have a positive indirect effect on the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, promoting frost resistance such as cold acclimation.</p>

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone signaling in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Moreover, exogenous application of BR enhanced chlorophyll content and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and decreased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins under nitrogen starvation. Leaf chlorosis and chlorophyll degradation were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under nitrogen starvation. Meanwhile, nitrogen starvation-induced expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion were compromised in both <i>BZR1</i>-silenced and <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s but were increased in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Taken together, our results suggest that BZR1-dependent BR signaling up-regulates the expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, which plays a critical role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> response to nitrogen starvation in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>).</p>

Giberellic Acid-Stimulated Transcript Proteins Evolved through Successive Conjugation of Novel Motifs and Their Subfunctionalization
<p><i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript</i> (<i>GAST</i>)-like genes encode small polypeptides, some of which have been implicated in diverse biological processes regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development. However, the occurrence of GASTs among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, their protein structures, and the mechanisms by which they evolved remain elusive. Here, using a customized workflow, we report genes encoding GAST proteins, identify novel motifs and evolutionary patterns contributing to the subfunctionalization of GAST domains, and explore functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation across diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> groups. We show that <i>GAST</i>-like sequences evolved initially in the vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i>, after the divergence from bryophytes, and later emerged in gymnosperms and angiosperms. GASTs in angiosperms are characterized by four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed novel motifs; however, relatively fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed motifs exist in pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GAST-Cysteine Rich1 motif evolved early in the <i>S. moellendorffii</i> GAST, which further acquired subfunctionalization through successive conjugation of other motifs and remained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, as supported by their collinearity. Functional characterization of two orthologs from the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated Arabidopsis 10</i>) and the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-Related 9</i>) suggests hormonal regulation, novel roles in seed germination, and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation among diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> groups. Computational modeling predicts that these <i>GAST</i> genes are regulated by several factors, including the phytohormones gibberellin and abscisic acid, through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed cis-motifs present in their promoters, and that they might act as signaling molecules in a complex feedback loop. Thus, our study identifies <i>GAST</i>s and their encoded proteins, uncovers their structure, novel motifs, and evolutionary pattern among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, and suggests their functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation.</p>

Plant-soil feedback and the maintenance of diversity in Mediterranean-climate shrublands
<p>Soil biota influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-soil feedback, but it is unclear whether the strength of such feedback depends on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> traits and whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-soil feedback drives local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> diversity. We grew 16 co-occurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> species with contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies from hyperdiverse Australian shrub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong>s and exposed them to soil biota from under their own or other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> species. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses to soil biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Simulations revealed that such strategy-dependent feedback is sufficient to maintain the high taxonomic and functional diversity characterizing these Mediterranean-climate shrub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong>s. Our study identifies nutrient-acquisition strategy as a key trait explaining how different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses to soil biota promote local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> diversity.</p>

Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> by early nonvascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Together, these observations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s through tandem gene duplication.</p>

A Novel N-Methyltransferase in Arabidopsis Appears to Feed a Conserved Pathway for Nicotinate Detoxification among Land Plants and Is Associated with Lignin Biosynthesis
<p>The Preiss-Handler pathway, which salvages nicotinate (NA) for NAD synthesis, is an indispensable biochemical pathway in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Various NA conjugations (mainly methylation and glycosylation) have been detected and have long been proposed for NA detoxification in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Previously, we demonstrated that NA <i>O</i>-glucosylation functions as a mobilizable storage form for NAD biosynthesis in the Brassicaceae. However, little is known about the functions of other NA conjugations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In this study, we first found that <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate is a ubiquitous NA conjugation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Furthermore, we functionally identified a novel methyltransferase (At3g53140; NA<i>N</i>MT), which is mainly responsible for <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We also established that trigonelline is a detoxification form of endogenous NA in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Combined phylogenetic analysis and enzymatic assays revealed that NA <i>N</i>-methylation activity was likely derived from the duplication and subfunctionalization of an ancestral caffeic acid <i>O</i>-methyltransferase (<i>COMT</i>) gene in the course of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> evolution. COMT enzymes, which function in <i>S</i>-lignin biosynthesis, also have weak NA<i>N</i>MT activity. Our data suggest that NA detoxification conferred by NA<i>N</i>MT and COMT might have facilitated the retention of the Preiss-Handler pathway in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Importance of Fluctuations in Light on Plant Photosynthetic Acclimation
<p>The acclimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to light has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effect of dynamic fluctuations in light on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phenotype and acclimatory responses. We mimicked natural fluctuations in light over a diurnal period to examine the effect on the photosynthetic processes and growth of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). High and low light intensities, delivered via a realistic dynamic fluctuating or square wave pattern, were used to grow and assess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s subjected to square wave light had thicker leaves and greater photosynthetic capacity compared with fluctuating light-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. This, together with elevated levels of proteins associated with electron transport, indicates greater investment in leaf structural components and photosynthetic processes. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating light had thinner leaves, lower leaf light absorption, but maintained similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area to square wave-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Despite high light use efficiency, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating light had a slow growth rate early in development, likely due to the fact that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating conditions were not able to fully utilize the light energy absorbed for carbon fixation. Diurnal leaf-level measurements revealed a negative feedback control of photosynthesis, resulting in a decrease in total diurnal carbon assimilated of at least 20%. These findings highlight that growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under square wave growth conditions ultimately fails to predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance under realistic light regimes and stress the importance of considering fluctuations in incident light in future experiments that aim to infer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> productivity under natural conditions in the field.</p>

Isoscapes resolve species-specific spatial patterns in plant–plant interactions in an invaded Mediterranean dune ecosystem
<p>Environmental heterogeneity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions are key factors shaping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> communities. However, the spatial dimension of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions has seldom been addressed in field studies. This is at least partially rooted in a lack of methods that can accurately resolve functional processes in a spatially explicit manner. Isoscapes, that is, spatially explicit representations of stable isotope data, provide a versatile means to trace functional changes on spatial scales, for example, related to N-cycling (foliar δ<sup>15</sup>N) and water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub>, foliar δ<sup>13</sup>C). In a case study in a nutrient-depleted Mediterranean dune ecosystem, we analysed the spatial impact of the invasive N<sub>2</sub>-fixing <i>Acacia longifolia</i> on three native species of different functional types using δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Isoscapes revealed strong spatial patterns in δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C with pronounced species-specific differences, demonstrating distinct spatial ranges of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions. A coniferous tree and an ericaceous dwarf shrub showed significant enrichment in δ<sup>15</sup>N within a range of 5–8 m surrounding the canopy of <i>A. longifolia</i>, indicating input of N originating from symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation by the invader. In the dwarf shrub, which was most responsive to invader influence, enrichment in δ<sup>13</sup>C additionally demonstrated spatially explicit changes to WUE<sub>i</sub>, while a native N<sub>2</sub>-fixer was unresponsive to the presence of the invader. Furthermore, δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes yielded different patterns, indicating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions can have distinct spatial distributions and ranges based on the process measured. Additionally, the magnitude of the effect differed between field situations with high and low invasion pressure. This study highlights that the spatial scale must be accounted for when assessing the effects and outcome of species interactions. Functional tracers such as stable isotopes enable us to quantify spatial ranges of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions, providing empirical data that can help to better understand and predict complex species interactions in multifaceted natural environments.</p>

Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p>Auxin controls body plan patterning in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and has been proposed to play a similar role in the development of brown algae (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The mechanism of auxin action in brown algae remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model system to show that auxin plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown algae. Indole-3-acetic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally develop a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meristem from the other, addition of exogenous auxins to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo developed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when variable extrinsic in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ional cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an inhibitor of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of transporters in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, affected rhizoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of auxin genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and transport genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) transporters from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>. Together with reports on auxin function in basal lineages of green algae, these results suggest that auxin function predates the divergence between the green and brown lineage and the transition toward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Origins and Evolution of Stomatal Development
<p>The fossil record suggests stomata-like pores were present on the surfaces of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s over 400 million years ago. Whether stomata arose once or whether they arose independently across newly evolving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> lineages has long been a matter of debate. In Arabidopsis, a genetic toolbox has been identified that tightly controls stomatal development and patterning. This includes the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors <i>SPEECHLESS</i> (<i>SPCH</i>), <i>MUTE</i>, <i>FAMA</i>, and <i>ICE/SCREAMs</i> (<i>SCRMs</i>), which promote stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. These factors are regulated via a signaling cascade, which includes mobile <i>EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR</i> (<i>EPF</i>) peptides to enforce stomatal spacing. Mosses and hornworts, the most ancient extant lineages to possess stomata, possess orthologs of these Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomatal toolbox genes, and manipulation in the model bryophyte <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> has shown that the bHLH and EPF components are also required for moss stomatal development and patterning. This supports an ancient and tightly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed genetic origin of stomata. Here, we review recent discoveries and, by interrogating newly available <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> genomes, we advance the story of stomatal development and patterning across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> evolution. Furthermore, we identify potential orthologs of the key toolbox genes in a hornwort, further supporting a single ancient genetic origin of stomata in the ancestor to all stomatous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

<i>Trichoderma</i> Histone Deacetylase HDA-2 Modulates Multiple Responses in Arabidopsis
<p><i>Trichoderma</i> spp. are a rich source of secondary metabolites and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which may induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses and modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth. In filamentous fungi, chromatin modifications regulate secondary metabolism. In this study we investigated how the absence of histone deacetylase HDA-2 in the <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> strain Δ<i>hda-2</i> impacts its effect on a host, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The production of VOCs and their impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development were assessed as well. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> strain was impaired in its ability to colonize Arabidopsis roots, thus affecting the promotion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and modulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses against foliar pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, which normally result from interaction with <i>T. atroviride</i>. Furthermore, Δ<i>hda-2</i> VOCs were incapable of triggering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses to counterattack foliar pathogens. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> overproduced the VOC 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP), which resulted in enhanced root branching and differentially regulated phytohormone-related genes. Analysis of ten VOCs (including 6-PP) revealed that three of them positively regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, whereas six had the opposite effect. Assessment of secondary metabolites, detoxification, and communication with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-related genes showed a dual role for HDA-2 in <i>T. atroviride</i> gene expression regulation during its interaction with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 on the promoters of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-responsive genes in Δ<i>hda-2</i> showed, in the presence of Arabidopsis, low levels of <i>epl-1</i> and <i>abc-2</i> compared with that in the wild type; whereas <i>ctf-1</i> presented high constitutive levels, supporting a dual role of HDA-2 in gene regulation. This work highlights the importance of HDA-2 as a global regulator in <i>Trichoderma</i> to modulate multiple responses in Arabidopsis.</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis modeling. However, the construction of accurate 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> models is challenging, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-based method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, tuning camera placement to match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> types.</p>

Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols, and esters, are formed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense at wound sites, indirect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense via the attraction of herbivore predators, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduction of C6-aldehydes into C6-alcohols is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde reduction remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-alcohol production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore infestation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which corresponded with reduced C6-alcohol levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered photosystem II activity. Our study shows that reductases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding toxicity from volatile carbonyls and in the attraction of herbivore predators.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> N use efficiency. The modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i>
<p>The phytohormone auxin regulates many aspects of growth and development in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, but the origin and evolution of auxin signaling and response mechanisms remain largely unknown. Indeed, it remains to be investigated whether auxin-related pathways diverged before the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. To address this knowledge deficit, we analyzed auxin responses in the charophyte alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i> NIES-2285, whose ancestor diverged from a green algal ancestor during the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. This strain is the same as <i>Klebsormidium flaccidum</i> NIES-2285, for which the draft genome was sequenced in 2014, and was taxonomically reclassified as <i>K. nitens</i>. This genome sequence revealed genes involved in auxin responses. Furthermore, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was detected in cultures of <i>K. nitens</i>, but <i>K. nitens</i> lacks the central regulators of the canonical auxin-signaling pathway found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Exogenous IAA inhibited cell division and cell elongation in <i>K. nitens</i>. Inhibitors of auxin biosynthesis and of polar auxin transport also inhibited cell division and elongation. Moreover, exogenous IAA rapidly induced expression of a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN transcription factor. These results suggest that <i>K. nitens</i> has acquired the part of the auxin system that regulates transcription and cell growth without the requirement for the central players that govern auxin signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Gcorn Plant: A Database for Retrieving Functional and Evolutionary Traits of Plant Genes
<p>Gene homology helps us understand gene function and speciation. The number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> genes and species registered in public databanks is continuously increasing. It is useful to associate homologous genes of various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to better understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> speciation. We designed the Gcorn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> database for the retrieval of in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion on homology and evolution of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> gene of interest. Amino acid sequences of 73 species (62 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 sequences, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology In<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion (NCBI) Reference Sequence database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these sequences, homologous genes were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a gene of interest, a phylogenetic tree, connecting genes with high homology indices, and line charts of the numbers of genes with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous genes, and on a phylogenetic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. Gcorn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> provides in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion on homologous genes at various virtual time points along with speciation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

The Potassium Transporter SlHAK10 Is Involved in Mycorrhizal Potassium Uptake
<p>Most terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s form a root symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which receive fixed carbon from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> and enhance the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>’s uptake of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al nutrients. AM symbiosis improves the phosphorous and nitrogen nutrition of host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s; however, little is known about the role of AM symbiosis in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) nutrition. Here, we report that inoculation with the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> improved tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and K<sup>+</sup> acquisition and that K<sup>+</sup> deficiency has a negative effect on root growth and AM colonization. Based on its homology to a <i>Lotus japonicus</i> AM-induced K<sup>+</sup> transporter, we identified a mycorrhiza-specific tomato K<sup>+</sup> transporter, SlHAK10 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum High-affinity Potassium Transporter10</i>), that was exclusively expressed in arbuscule-containing cells. <i>SlHAK10</i> could restore a yeast K<sup>+</sup> uptake-defective mutant in the low-affinity concentration range. Loss of function of <i>SlHAK10</i> led to a significant decrease in mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake and AM colonization rate under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions but did not affect arbuscule development. Overexpressing <i>SlHAK10</i> from the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the AM-specific <i>Solanum melongena Phosphate Transporter4</i> not only improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and K<sup>+</sup> uptake but also increased AM colonization efficiency and soluble sugar content in roots supplied with low K<sup>+</sup>. Our results indicate that tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have a SlHAK10<i>-</i>mediated mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake pathway and that improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> K<sup>+</sup> nutrition could increase carbohydrate accumulation in roots, which facilitates AM fungal colonization.</p>

A Group D MAPK Protects Plants from Autotoxicity by Suppressing Herbivore-Induced Defense Signaling
<p>The mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s activate and enhance defense responses have been well studied; however, the regulatory mechanisms that allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to avoid excessive defense responses are poorly understood. Here, we identified a group D mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>OsMAPK20-5</i>, whose expression was rapidly induced by infestation of gravid female adults of a destructive rice pest, brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>), but not by BPH nymphs. Expression silencing of <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) after gravid female BPH infestation, and thereby increased rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs. However, when exposed to high densities of gravid BPH females, irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s wilted earlier than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which could be attributed to the hyperaccumulation of ethylene and NO in irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Interestingly, when released into the field, irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed broad resistance to BPH and white-backed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (<i>Sogatella furcifera</i>), the two most destructive pests of rice, and produced higher yield. Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers, it also enables rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense-response–related autotoxicity.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s outperformed wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

MicroRNA166 Modulates Cadmium Tolerance and Accumulation in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20- to 24-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> miRNAs, such as miR166, have vital roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, development and responses to environmental stresses. One such environmental stress encountered by crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s is exposure to cadmium (Cd), an element highly toxic to most organisms, including humans and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In this study, we analyzed the role of miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The expression levels of miR166 in both root and leaf tissues were significantly higher in the reproductive stage than in the seedling stage in rice. The expression of miR166 in the roots of rice seedlings was reduced after Cd treatment. Overexpression of miR166 in rice improved Cd tolerance, a result associated with the reduction of Cd-induced oxidative stress in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Furthermore, overexpression of miR166 reduced both Cd translocation from roots to shoots and Cd accumulation in the grains. miR166 targets genes encoding the class-III homeodomain-Leu zipper (HD-Zip) family proteins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In rice, <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>) gene (Os03g43930), which encodes an HD-Zip protein, was up-regulated by Cd treatment but down-regulated by overexpression of miR166 in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Overexpression of <i>OsHB4</i> increased Cd sensitivity and Cd accumulation in the leaves and grains of transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. By contrast, silencing <i>OsHB4</i> by RNA interference enhanced Cd tolerance in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. These results indicate a critical role for miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance through regulation of its target gene, <i>OsHB4</i>, in rice.</p>

Arabidopsis β-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine β-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized enzyme reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation of amino acids in the active site of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic kinetics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light scattering, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a monomer. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were mapped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed surface away from the active site that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding site. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure. Expression analysis indicated that BAM2 is more closely coexpressed with other starch degradation enzymes than any other BAM, suggesting that BAM2 may play an important role in starch degradation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture is a key factor affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>ing density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in maize breeding.</p>

Determining the Site of Action of Strigolactones during Nodulation
<p>Strigolactones (SLs) influence the ability of legumes to associate with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. In this study, we determine the precise stage at which SLs influence nodulation. We show that SLs promote infection thread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, as a null SL-deficient pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) mutant forms significantly fewer infection threads than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, and this reduction can be overcome by the application of the synthetic SL GR24. We found no evidence that SLs influence physical events in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> before or after infection thread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, since SL-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed a similar ability to induce root hair curling in response to rhizobia or Nod lipochitooligosaccharides (LCOs) and SL-deficient nodules appear to fix nitrogen at a similar rate to those of wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In contrast, an SL receptor mutant displayed no decrease in infection thread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion or nodule number, suggesting that SL deficiency may influence the bacterial partner. We found that this influence of SL deficiency was not due to altered flavonoid exudation or the ability of root exudates to stimulate bacterial growth. The influence of SL deficiency on infection thread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion was accompanied by reduced expression of some early nodulation genes. Importantly, SL synthesis is down-regulated by mutations in genes of the Nod LCO signaling pathway, and this requires the downstream transcription factor <i>NSP2</i> but not <i>NIN</i>. This, together with the fact that the expression of certain SL biosynthesis genes can be elevated in response to rhizobia/Nod LCOs, suggests that Nod LCOs may induce SL biosynthesis. SLs appear to influence nodulation independently of ethylene action, as SL-deficient and ethylene-insensitive double mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s display essentially additive phenotypes, and we found no evidence that SLs influence ethylene synthesis or vice versa.</p>

Fern Stomatal Responses to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> Depend on Species and Growth Conditions

Evolution has shaped the morphology and regulatory mechanisms governing stomatal movements to correspond to the needs of various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> groups over the past 400 million years. Stomata close in response to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> hormone abscisic acid (ABA), elevated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and reduced air humidity. Whether the active regulatory mechanisms that control stomatal closure in response to these stimuli are present already in mosses, the oldest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> group with stomata, or were acquired more recently in angiosperms remains controversial. It has been suggested that the stomata of the basal vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, such as ferns and lycophytes, close solely hydropassively. On the other hand, active stomatal closure in response to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> was found in several moss, lycophyte, and fern species. Here, we show that the stomata of two temperate fern species respond to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> and that an active mechanism of stomatal regulation in response to reduced air humidity is present in some ferns. Importantly, fern stomatal responses depend on growth conditions. The data indicate that the stomatal behavior of ferns is more complex than anticipated before, and active stomatal regulation is present in some ferns and has possibly been lost in others. Further analysis that takes into account fern species, life history, evolutionary age, and growth conditions is required to gain insight into the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> stomatal responses.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the microspores is compromised, leading to aborted pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and microspores during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells.

Evolution of alluvial mudrock forced by early land plants
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mud</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s are a primary archive of Earth’s history from the Archean eon to recent times, and their source-to-sink production and deposition play a central role in long-term ocean chemistry and climate regulation. Using original and published stratigraphic data from all 704 of Earth’s known alluvial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ions from the Archean eon (3.5 billion years ago) to the Carboniferous period (0.3 billion years ago), we prove contentions of an upsurge in the proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mud</span></strong> retained on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> coeval with vegetation evolution. We constrain the onset of the upsurge to the Ordovician-Silurian and show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alluvium</span></strong> deposited after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> evolution contains a proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mud</span></strong><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong> that is, on average, 1.4 orders of magnitude greater than the proportion contained in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">alluvium</span></strong> from the preceding 90% of Earth’s history. We attribute this shift to the ways in which vegetation revolutionized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mud</span></strong> production and sediment flux from continental interiors.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed chlorophyll degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> seed production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> seed yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type seed and no reduction in <i>fa</i> seed. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to accumulate biomass and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> biomass combined with delayed chlorophyll degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

The Tomato Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase SlMPK1 Is as a Negative Regulator of the High-Temperature Stress Response
<p>High-temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development. MAPK cascades play key roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and stress signaling, but their involvement in the HT stress response is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 47-kD MBP-phosphorylated protein (p47-MBPK) activated in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves under HT and identify it as SlMPK1 by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of <i>SlMPK1</i> in transgenic tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s resulted in enhanced tolerance to HT, while overexpression resulted in reduced tolerance. Proteomic analysis identified a set of proteins involved in antioxidant defense that are significantly more abundant in RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s than nontransgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under HT stress. RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also showed changes in membrane lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a serine-proline-rich protein homolog, SlSPRH1, which interacts with SlMPK1 in yeast, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cells, and in vitro. We demonstrate that SlMPK1 can directly phosphorylate SlSPRH1. Furthermore, the serine residue serine-44 of SlSPRH1 is a crucial phosphorylation site in the SlMPK1-mediated antioxidant defense mechanism activated during HT stress. We also demonstrate that heterologous expression of <i>SlSPRH1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) led to a decrease in thermotolerance and lower antioxidant capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that SlMPK1 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance in tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. SlMPK1 acts by regulating antioxidant defense, and its substrate SlSPRH1 is involved in this pathway.</p>

Out of Water: The Origin and Early Diversification of Plant <i>R</i>-Genes
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-pathogen interactions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s use intracellular proteins with nucleotide-binding site and Leu-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains to detect pathogens. NBS-LRR proteins represent a major class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> disease resistance genes (<i>R</i>-genes). Whereas <i>R</i>-genes have been well characterized in angiosperms, little is known about their origin and early diversification. Here, we perform comprehensive evolutionary analyses of <i>R</i>-genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and report the identification of <i>R</i>-genes in basal-branching streptophytes, including charophytes, liverworts, and mosses. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> <i>R</i>-genes originated in charophytes and R-proteins diversified into TIR-NBS-LRR proteins and non-TIR-NBS-LRR proteins in charophytes. Moreover, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> R-proteins evolved in a modular fashion through frequent gain or loss of protein domains. Most of the <i>R</i>-genes in basal-branching streptophytes underwent adaptive evolution, indicating an ancient involvement of <i>R</i>-genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-pathogen interactions. Our findings provide novel insights into the origin and evolution of <i>R</i>-genes and the mechanisms underlying colonization of terrestrial environments by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

The MtDMI2-MtPUB2 Negative Feedback Loop Plays a Role in Nodulation Homeostasis
<p>DOES NOT MAKE INFECTION 2 (MtDMI2) is a Leu rich repeat-type receptor kinase required for signal transduction in the <i>Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> symbiosis pathway. However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in nodulation homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulation were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s) exhibited impaired infection threads, fewer nodules, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s transformed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were transformed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer nodules than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitination activity, and their nodulation phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s transformed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative feedback loop of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative feedback loop, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulation of nodulation via MtNIN, plays an important role in nodulation homeostasis.</p>

Knockdown of Rice MicroRNA166 Confers Drought Resistance by Causing Leaf Rolling and Altering Stem Xylem Development
<p>MicroRNAs are 19- to 22-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that have been implicated in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we found that knockdown of microRNA166, using the Short Tandem Target Mimic (STTM) system, resulted in morphological changes that confer drought resistance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). From a large-scale screen for miRNA knockdown lines in rice, we identified miR166 knockdown lines (STTM166); these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibit a rolled-leaf phenotype, which is normally displayed by rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under drought stress. The leaves of STTM166 rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had smaller bulliform cells and abnormal sclerenchymatous cells, likely causing the rolled-leaf phenotype. The STTM166 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had reduced stomatal conductance and showed decreased transpiration rates. The STTM166 lines also exhibited altered stem xylem and decreased hydraulic conductivity, likely due to the reduced diameter of the xylem vessels. Molecular analyses identified rice <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>), a member of HD-Zip III gene family, as a major target of miR166; moreover, rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing a miR166-resistant form of <i>OsHB4</i> resembled the STTM166 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, including leaf rolling and higher drought resistance. The genes downstream of miR166-<i>OsHB4</i> consisted of polysaccharide synthesis-related genes that may contribute to cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and vascular development. Our results suggest that drought resistance in rice can be increased by manipulating miRNAs, which leads to developmental changes, such as leaf rolling and reduced diameter of the xylem, that mimic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s’ natural responses to water-deficit stress.</p>

Fine-Tuning of Photosynthesis Requires CURVATURE THYLAKOID1-Mediated Thylakoid Plasticity
<p>The thylakoid membrane system of higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> chloroplasts consists of interconnected subdomains of appressed and nonappressed membrane bilayers, known as grana and stroma lamellae, respectively. CURVATURE THYLAKOID1 (CURT1) protein complexes mediate the shape of grana stacks in a dosage-dependent manner and facilitate membrane curvature at the grana margins, the interface between grana and stroma lamellae. Although grana stacks are highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, the functional relevance of grana stacking remains unclear. Here, we show that inhibiting CURT1-mediated alteration of thylakoid ultrastructure in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reduces photosynthetic efficiency and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> fitness under adverse, controlled, and natural light conditions. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s that lack CURT1 show less adjustment of grana diameter, which compromises regulatory mechanisms like the photosystem II repair cycle and state transitions. Interestingly, CURT1A suffices to induce thylakoid membrane curvature in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>a and thylakoid hyperbending in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing CURT1A. We suggest that CURT1 oligomerization is regulated at the posttranslational level in a light-dependent fashion and that CURT1-mediated thylakoid plasticity plays an important role in fine-tuning photosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> fitness during challenging growth conditions.</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als and the control that the leaf exerts over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al distribution that is preserved in different environments. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

A Mucin-Like Protein of Planthopper Is Required for Feeding and Induces Immunity Response in Plants
<p>The brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>, is a pest that threatens rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide. While feeding on rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers secrete saliva, which plays crucial roles in nutrient ingestion and modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense responses, although the specific functions of salivary proteins remain largely unknown. We identified an <i>N. lugens</i>-secreted mucin-like protein (NlMLP) by transcriptome and proteome analyses and characterized its function, both in brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. <i>NlMLP</i> is highly expressed in salivary g<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong>s and is secreted into rice during feeding. Inhibition of <i>NlMLP</i> expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers disturbs the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of salivary sheaths, thereby reducing their performance. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, NlMLP induces cell death, the expression of defense-related genes, and callose deposition. These defense responses are related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and the MEK2 MAP kinase and jasmonic acid signaling pathways. The active region of NlMLP that elicits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses is located in its carboxyl terminus. Our work provides a detailed characterization of a salivary protein from a piercing-sucking insect other than aphids. Our finding that the protein functions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> immune responses offers new insights into the mechanism underlying interactions between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and herbivorous insects.</p>

Cytological and Transcriptomic Analyses Reveal Important Roles of <i>CLE19</i> in Pollen Exine Formation
<p>The CLAVATA3/ESR-RELATED (CLE) peptide signals are required for cell-cell communication in several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and developmental processes. However, little is known regarding the possible functions of the CLEs in the anther. Here, we show that a T-DNA insertional mutant, and dominant-negative (DN) and overexpression (OX) transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s of the <i>CLE19</i> gene, exhibited significantly reduced anther size and pollen grain number and abnormal pollen wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Interestingly, the <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i> pollen grains showed a more extensively covered surface, but <i>CLE19-OX</i> pollen exine exhibited clearly missing connections in the network and lacked separation between areas that normally form the lacunae. With a combination of cell biological, genetic, and transcriptomic analyses on <i>cle19</i>, <i>DN</i>-<i>CLE19</i>, and <i>CLE19-OX</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, we demonstrated that <i>CLE19-OX</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s produced highly vacuolated and swollen <i>aborted microspores</i> (<i>ams</i>)-like tapetal cells, lacked lipidic tapetosomes and elaioplasts, and had abnormal pollen primexine without obvious accumulation of sporopollenin precursors. Moreover, <i>CLE19</i> is important for the normal expression of more than 1,000 genes, including the transcription factor gene <i>AMS</i>, 280 <i>AMS</i>-downstream genes, and other genes involved in pollen coat and pollen exine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, lipid metabolism, pollen germination, and hormone metabolism. In addition, the <i>DN-CLE19(+/+) ams(−/−)</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibited the <i>ams</i> anther phenotype and <i>ams(+/−)</i> partially suppressed the <i>DN-CLE19</i> transgene-induced pollen exine defects.

A Salivary Endo-β-1,4-Glucanase Acts as an Effector That Enables the Brown Planthopper to Feed on Rice
<p>The brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (BPH) <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i> is one of the most destructive insect pests on rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) in Asia. After <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong>ing on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, BPH rapidly accesses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phloem and sucks the phloem sap through unknown mechanisms. We discovered a salivary endo-β-1,4-glucanase (NlEG1) that has endoglucanase activity with a maximal activity at pH 6 at 37°C and is secreted into rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s by BPH. <i>NlEG1</i> is highly expressed in the salivary g<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong>s and midgut. Silencing <i>NlEG1</i> decreases the capacity of BPH to reach the phloem and reduces its food intake, mass, survival, and fecundity on rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. By contrast, <i>NlEG1</i> silencing had only a small effect on the survival rate of BPH raised on artificial diet. Moreover, NlEG1 secreted by BPH did not elicit the production of the defense-related signal molecules salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in rice, although wounding plus the application of the recombination protein NlEG1 did slightly enhance the levels of jasmonic acid and jasmonoyl-isoleucine in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with the corresponding controls. These data suggest that NlEG1 enables the BPH’s stylet to reach the phloem by degrading celluloses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cell walls, thereby functioning as an effector that overcomes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cell wall defense in rice.</p>

Phosphorylation of MAP65-1 by Arabidopsis Aurora Kinases Is Required for Efficient Cell Cycle Progression
<p>Aurora kinases are key effectors of mitosis. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> Auroras are functionally divided into two clades. The alpha Auroras (Aurora1 and Aurora2) associate with the spindle and the cell plate and are implicated in controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ive divisions throughout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> development. The beta Aurora (Aurora3) localizes to centromeres and likely functions in chromosome separation. In contrast to the wealth of data available on the role of Aurora in other kingdoms, knowledge on their function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s is merely emerging. This is exemplified by the fact that only histone H3 and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> homolog of TPX2 have been identified as Aurora substrates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Here we provide biochemical, genetic, and cell biological evidence that the microtubule-bundling protein MAP65-1—a member of the MAP65/Ase1/PRC1 protein family, implicated in central spindle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and cytokinesis in animals, yeasts, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s—is a genuine substrate of alpha Aurora kinases. MAP65-1 interacts with Aurora1 in vivo and is phosphorylated on two residues at its unfolded tail domain. Its overexpression and down-regulation antagonistically affect the alpha Aurora double mutant phenotypes. Phospho-mutant analysis shows that Aurora contributes to the microtubule bundling capacity of MAP65-1 in concert with other mitotic kinases.</p>

While investigating the roles of different G-protein subunits in modulating the oil content in Camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>), an oil seed crop, we uncovered a role of Gβ proteins in controlling anisotropic cell expansion. Knockdown of <i>Gβ</i> genes causes reduced longitudinal and enhanced transverse expansion, resulting in altered cell, tissue, and organ shapes in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s during vegetative and reproductive development. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also exhibited substantial changes in their fatty acid and phospholipid profiles, which possibly leads to the increased oil content of the transgenic seeds. This increase is potentially caused by the direct interaction of Gβ proteins with a specific patatin-like phospholipase, pPLAIIIδ. Camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with suppressed <i>Gβ</i> expression exhibit higher lipase activity, and show phenotypes similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing <i>pPLAIIIδ</i>, suggesting that the Gβ proteins are negative regulators of pPLAIIIδ. These results reveal interactions between the G-protein–mediated and lipid signaling/metabolic pathways, where specific phospholipases may act as effectors that control key developmental and environmental responses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s integrate these environmental cues to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation enzyme, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic enzyme, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s integrate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have evolved for growth and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and water use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> water use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve crop yields and enhance agricultural sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size and water use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-watered and water-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size and water use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size given water use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size, water use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil water availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> WUE under different watering treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

<i>ELIGULUM-A</i> Regulates Lateral Branch and Leaf Development in Barley
<p>The shoot apical and axillary meristems control shoot development, effectively influencing lateral branch and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. The barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) <i>uniculm2</i> (<i>cul2</i>) mutation blocks axillary meristem development, and mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s lack lateral branches (tillers) that normally develop from the crown. A genetic screen for <i>cul2</i> suppressors recovered two recessive alleles of <i>ELIGULUM-A</i> (<i>ELI-A</i>) that partially rescued the <i>cul2</i> tillering phenotype. Mutations in <i>ELI-A</i> produce shorter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with fewer tillers and disrupt the leaf blade-sheath boundary, producing liguleless leaves and reduced secondary cell wall development in stems and leaves. <i>ELI-A</i> is predicted to encode an unannotated protein containing an RNaseH-like domain that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts accumulate at the preligule boundary, the developing ligule, leaf margins, cells destined to develop secondary cell walls, and cells surrounding leaf vascular bundles. Recent studies have identified regulatory similarities between boundary development in leaves and lateral organs. Interestingly, we observed <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the preligule boundary, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to boundary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion between the blade and sheath. However, we did not observe <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the axillary meristem boundary in leaf axils, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> is not involved in boundary development for axillary meristem development. Our results show that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to leaf and lateral branch development by acting as a boundary gene during ligule development but not during lateral branch development.</p>

STRESS INDUCED FACTOR 2, a Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase Regulates Basal Plant Pathogen Defense
<p>Protein kinases play fundamental roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> development and environmental stress responses. Here, we identified the <i>STRESS INDUCED FACTOR</i> (<i>SIF</i>) gene family, which encodes four leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinases in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The four genes, <i>SIF1</i> to <i>SIF4</i>, are clustered in the genome and highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed, but they have temporally and spatially distinct expression patterns. We employed Arabidopsis <i>SIF</i> knockout mutants and overexpression transgenics to examine SIF involvement during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> pathogen defense. <i>SIF</i> genes are rapidly induced by biotic or abiotic stresses, and SIF proteins localize to the plasma membrane. Simultaneous knockout of <i>SIF1</i> and <i>SIF2</i> led to improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> salt tolerance, whereas <i>SIF2</i> overexpression enhanced PAMP-triggered immunity and prompted basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses, significantly improving pathogen resistance. Furthermore, <i>SIF2</i> overexpression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibited up-regulated expression of the defense-related genes <i>WRKY53</i> and <i>flg22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1</i> as well as enhanced MPK3/MPK6 phosphorylation upon pathogen and elicitor treatments. The expression of the calcium signaling-related gene <i>PHOSPHATE-INDUCED1</i> also was enhanced in the <i>SIF2</i>-overexpressing lines upon pathogen inoculation but repressed in the <i>sif2</i> mutants. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation demonstrates that the BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1 protein is a coreceptor of the SIF2 kinase in the signal transduction pathway during pathogen invasion. These findings characterize a stress-responsive protein kinase family and illustrate how SIF2 modulates signal transduction for effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> pathogenic defense.</p>

Transcription Factor-Mediated Control of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Vegetative Tissues
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s accumulate secondary metabolites to adapt to environmental conditions. These compounds, here exemplified by the purple-colored anthocyanins, are accumulated upon high temperatures, UV-light, drought, and nutrient deficiencies, and may contribute to tolerance to these stresses. Producing compounds is often part of a more broad response of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> to changes in the environment. Here we investigate how a transcription-factor-mediated program for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis also has effects on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of specialized cell structures and changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> root architecture. A systems biology approach was developed in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) for coordinated induction of biosynthesis of anthocyanins, in a tissue- and development-independent manner. A transcription factor couple from <i>Antirrhinum</i> that is known to control anthocyanin biosynthesis was introduced in tomato under control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. By application of dexamethasone, anthocyanin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion was induced within 24 h in vegetative tissues and in undifferentiated cells. Profiles of metabolites and gene expression were analyzed in several tomato tissues. Changes in concentration of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds were observed in all tested tissues, accompanied by induction of the biosynthetic pathways leading from Glc to anthocyanins. A number of pathways that are not known to be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were observed to be regulated. Anthocyanin-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed profound physiological and architectural changes, depending on the tissue, including root branching, root epithelial cell morphology, seed germination, and leaf conductance. The inducible anthocyanin-production system reveals a range of phenomena that accompanies anthocyanin biosynthesis in tomato, including adaptions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s architecture and physiology.</p>

Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> that is well adapted to partial flooding. Rice stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> gets flooded, leading to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of a whole new secondary root system upon flooding. AR growth is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root system in flooded rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and growth of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of growth direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120° in the dark and downward at 54° in the light. The upward growth direction is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties, suggestive of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed trait in rice. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward growth by about 10°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative phototropism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR system architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile phototropism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the phototropin-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of rice ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward growth) with avoidance of root desiccation (downward growth).</p>

Identification of a New Host Factor Required for Antiviral RNAi and Amplification of Viral siRNAs
<p>Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are processed from virus-specific dsRNA to direct antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) in diverse eukaryotic hosts. We have recently performed a sensitized genetic screen in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and identified two related phospholipid flippases required for antiviral RNAi and the amplification of virus-derived siRNAs by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> RNA-dependent RNA polymerase1 (RDR1) and RDR6. Here we report the identification and cloning of <i>ANTIVIRAL RNAI</i>-<i>DEFECTIVE2</i> (<i>AVI2</i>) from the same genetic screen. <i>AVI2</i> encodes a multispan transmembrane protein broadly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and animals with two homologous human proteins known as magnesium transporters. We show that <i>avi2</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s display no developmental defects and develop severe disease symptoms after infection with a mutant <i>Cucumber mosaic virus</i> (CMV) defective in RNAi suppression. <i>AVI2</i> is induced by CMV infection, particularly in veins, and is required for antiviral RNAi and RDR6-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs. AVI2 is also necessary for Dicer-like2-mediated amplification of 22-nucleotide viral siRNAs induced in <i>dcl4</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s by infection, but dispensable for RDR6-dependent biogenesis of endogenous transacting siRNAs. Further genetic studies illustrate that AVI2 plays a partially redundant role with AVI2H, the most closely related member in the <i>AVI2</i> gene family, in RDR1-dependent biogenesis of viral siRNAs and the endogenous virus-activated siRNAs (vasi-RNAs). Interestingly, we discovered a specific genetic interaction of AVI2 with AVI1 flippase that is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> development. We propose that AVI1 and AVI2 participate in the virus-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of the RDR1/RDR6-specific, membrane-bound RNA synthesis compartment, essential for the biogenesis of highly abundant viral siRNAs and vasi-RNAs.</p>

The Distinct Roles of Class I and II RPD3-Like Histone Deacetylases in Salinity Stress Response
<p>Histone acetylation is an essential process in the epigenetic regulation of diverse biological processes, including environmental stress responses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Previously, our research group identified a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (HDI) that confers salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In this study, we demonstrate that class I HDAC (HDA19) and class II HDACs (HDA5/14/15/18) control responses to salt stress through different pathways. The screening of 12 different selective HDIs indicated that seven newly reported HDIs enhance salt tolerance. Genetic analysis, based on a pharmacological study, identified which HDACs function in salinity stress tolerance. In the wild-type Columbia-0 background, <i>hda19</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibit tolerance to high-salinity stress, while <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibit hypersensitivity to salt stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the effect of <i>HDA19</i> deficiency on the response to salinity stress is distinct from that of <i>HDA5/14/15/18</i> deficiencies. In <i>hda19</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, the expression levels of stress tolerance-related genes, late embryogenesis abundant proteins that prevent protein aggregation and positive regulators such as ABI5 and NAC019 in abscisic acid signaling, were induced strongly relative to the wild type. Neither of these elements was up-regulated in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The mutagenesis of HDA19 by genome editing in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting that suppression of HDA19 masks the phenotype caused by the suppression of class II HDACs in the salinity stress response. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HDIs that inhibit class I HDACs allow the rescue of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s from salinity stress regardless of their selectivity, and they provide insight into the hierarchal regulation of environmental stress responses through HDAC isoforms.</p>

Wounding Triggers Callus Formation via Dynamic Hormonal and Transcriptional Changes
<p>Wounding is a primary trigger of organ regeneration, but how wound stress reactivates cell proliferation and promotes cellular reprogramming remains elusive. In this study, we combined transcriptome analysis with quantitative hormonal analysis to investigate how wounding induces callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our time course RNA-seq analysis revealed that wounding induces dynamic transcriptional changes, starting from rapid stress responses followed by the activation of metabolic processes and protein synthesis and subsequent activation of cell cycle regulators. Gene ontology analyses further uncovered that wounding modifies the expression of hormone biosynthesis and response genes, and quantitative analysis of endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> hormones revealed accumulation of cytokinin prior to callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Mutants defective in cytokinin synthesis and signaling display reduced efficiency in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, indicating that de novo synthesis of cytokinin is critical for wound-induced callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. We further demonstrate that type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR-mediated cytokinin signaling regulates the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;1</i> (<i>CYCD3;1</i>) and that mutations in <i>CYCD3;1</i> and its homologs <i>CYCD3;2</i> and <i>3</i> cause defects in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. In addition to these hormone-mediated changes, our transcriptome data uncovered that wounding activates multiple developmental regulators, and we found novel roles of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 115 and PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLT5, and PLT7 in callus generation. All together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into how wounding reactivates cell proliferation during callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion.</p>

<i>S5H/DMR6</i> Encodes a Salicylic Acid 5-Hydroxylase That Fine-Tunes Salicylic Acid Homeostasis
<p>The phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) plays essential roles in biotic and abiotic responses, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> development, and leaf senescence. 2,5-Dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA or gentisic acid) is one of the most commonly occurring aromatic acids in green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and is assumed to be generated from SA, but the enzymes involved in its production remain obscure. DMR6 (Downy Mildew Resistant6; At5g24530) has been proven essential in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> immunity of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), but its biochemical properties are not well understood. Here, we report the discovery and functional characterization of DMR6 as a salicylic acid 5-hydroxylase (S5H) that catalyzes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of 2,5-DHBA by hydroxylating SA at the C5 position of its phenyl ring in Arabidopsis. S5H/DMR6 specifically converts SA to 2,5-DHBA in vitro and displays higher catalytic efficiency (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 4.96 × 10<sup>4</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) than the previously reported S3H (<i>K</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> = 6.09 × 10<sup>3</sup> <sc>m</sc><sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) for SA. Interestingly, S5H/DMR6 displays a substrate inhibition property that may enable automatic control of its enzyme activities. The <i>s5h</i> mutant and <i>s5hs3h</i> double mutant overaccumulate SA and display phenotypes such as a smaller growth size, early senescence, and a loss of susceptibility to <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. <i>S5H</i>/<i>DMR6</i> is sensitively induced by SA/pathogen treatment and is expressed widely from young seedlings to senescing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, whereas <i>S3H</i> is more specifically expressed at the mature and senescing stages. Collectively, our results disclose the identity of the enzyme required for 2,5-DHBA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and reveal a mechanism by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s fine-tune SA homeostasis by mediating SA 5-hydroxylation.</p>

Genome-Wide Development and Use of Microsatellite Markers for Large-Scale Genotyping Applications in Foxtail Millet [<i>Setaria italica</i> (L.)]
<p>The availability of well-validated informative co-dominant microsatellite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s and saturated genetic linkage map has been limited in foxtail millet (<i>Setaria italica</i> L.). In view of this, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and identified 28 342 microsatellite repeat-motifs spanning 405.3 Mb of foxtail millet genome. The trinucleotide repeats (∼48%) was prevalent when compared with dinucleotide repeats (∼46%). Of the 28 342 microsatellites, 21 294 (∼75%) primer pairs were successfully designed, and a total of 15 573 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s were physically mapped on 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet. About 159 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s were validated successfully in 8 accessions of <i>Setaria</i> sp. with ∼67% polymorphic potential. The high percentage (89.3%) of cross-genera transferability across millet and non-millet species with higher transferability percentage in bioenergy grasses (∼79%, Switchgrass and ∼93%, Pearl millet) signifies their importance in studying the bioenergy grasses. <i>In silico</i> comparative mapping of 15 573 foxtail millet microsatellite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s against the mapping data of sorghum (16.9%), maize (14.5%) and rice (6.4%) indicated syntenic relationships among the chromosomes of foxtail millet and target species. The results, thus, demonstrate the immense applicability of developed microsatellite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s in germplasm characterization, phylogenetics, construction of genetic linkage map for gene/quantitative trait loci discovery, comparative mapping in foxtail millet, including other millets and bioenergy grass species.</p>

Radiation-Induced DNA Damage in Operators Performing Endovascular Aortic Repair
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Radiation exposure during fluoroscopically guided interventions such as endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is a growing concern for operators. This study aimed to measure DNA damage/repair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s in operators perfoming EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Expression of the DNA damage/repair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>, γ-H2AX and DNA damage response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>, phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (pATM), were quantified in circulating lymphocytes in operators during the peri-operative period of endovascular (infrarenal, branched, and fenestrated) and open aortic repair using flow cytometry. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s were separately measured in the same operators but this time wearing leg lead shielding in addition to upper body protection and compared with those operating with unprotected legs. Susceptibility to radiation damage was determined by irradiating operators’ blood in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>γ-H2AX and pATM levels increased significantly in operators immediately after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.0003 for both). Only pATM levels increased after infrarenal endovascular aortic repair (<i>P</i><0.04). Expression of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s fell to baseline in operators after 24 hours (<i>P</i><0.003 for both). There was no change in γ-H2AX or pATM expression after open repair. Leg protection abrogated γ-H2AX and pATM response after branched endovascular aortic repair/fenestrated endovascular aortic repair. The expression of γ-H2AX varied significantly when operators’ blood was exposed to the same radiation dose in vitro (<i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This is the first study to detect an acute DNA damage response in operators performing fluoroscopically guided aortic procedures and highlights the protective effect of leg shielding.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Aldehyde Oxidase 4 Plays a Critical Role in Delaying Silique Senescence by Catalyzing Aldehyde Detoxification
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) aldehyde oxidases are a multigene family of four oxidases (AAO1–AAO4) that oxidize a variety of aldehydes, among them abscisic aldehyde, which is oxidized to the phytohormone abscisic acid. Toxic aldehydes are generated in plants both under normal conditions and in response to stress. The detoxification of such aldehydes by oxidation is attributed to aldehyde dehydrogenases but never to aldehyde oxidases. The feasibility of the detoxification of aldehydes in siliques via oxidation by AAO4 was demonstrated, first, by its ability to efficiently oxidize an array of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, including the reactive carbonyl species (RCS) acrolein, hydroxyl-2-nonenal, and malondialdehyde. Next, exogenous application of several aldehydes to siliques in AAO4 knockout (KO) Arabidopsis plants induced severe tissue damage and enhanced malondialdehyde levels and senescence symptoms, but not in wild-type siliques. Furthermore, abiotic stresses such as dark and ultraviolet C irradiation caused an increase in endogenous RCS and higher expression levels of senescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> genes, leading to premature senescence of KO siliques, whereas RCS and senescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> levels in wild-type siliques were hardly affected. Finally, in naturally senesced KO siliques, higher endogenous RCS levels were associated with enhanced senescence molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s, chlorophyll degradation, and earlier seed shattering compared with the wild type. The aldehyde-dependent differential generation of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by AAO4 and the induction of AAO4 expression by hydrogen peroxide shown here suggest a self-amplification mechanism for detoxifying additional reactive aldehydes produced during stress. Taken together, our results indicate that AAO4 plays a critical role in delaying senescence in siliques by catalyzing aldehyde detoxification.</p>

A Tightly Regulated Genetic Selection System with Signaling-Active Alleles of Phytochrome B
<p>Selectable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s derived from plant genes circumvent the potential risk of antibiotic/herbicide-resistance gene transfer into neighboring plant species, endophytic bacteria, and mycorrhizal fungi.

By probing the relationship of construct size and induction conditions to optimal phenotypic selection, we show that <i>eYHB</i>-based alleles are robust substitutes for antibiotic/herbicide-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> genes as well as surprisingly sensitive reporters of off-target transgene expression.</p>

Improving the accuracy of synovial fluid analysis in the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection with simple and inexpensive biomarkers
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to increase the diagnostic accuracy   of the analysis of synovial fluid in the differentiation of prosthetic   joint infection (PJI) by the addition of inexpensive bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s   such as the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), adenosine deaminase   (ADA), alpha-2-macrogloblulin (α2M) and procalcitonin.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between January 2013 and December 2015, synovial fluid and removed   implants were requested from 143 revision total joint arthroplasties.

Single-Cell Sequencing of the Healthy and Diseased Heart Reveals Cytoskeleton-Associated Protein 4 as a New Modulator of Fibroblasts Activation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Genome-wide transcriptome analysis has greatly advanced our understanding of the regulatory networks underlying basic cardiac biology and mechanisms driving disease. However, so far, the resolution of studying gene expression patterns in the adult heart has been limited to the level of extracts from whole tissues. The use of tissue homogenates inherently causes the loss of any information on cellular origin or cell type-specific changes in gene expression. Recent developments in RNA amplification strategies provide a unique opportunity to use small amounts of input RNA for genome-wide sequencing of single cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we present a method to obtain high-quality RNA from digested cardiac tissue from adult mice for automated single-cell sequencing of both the healthy and diseased heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After optimization, we were able to perform single-cell sequencing on adult cardiac tissue under both homeostatic conditions and after ischemic injury. Clustering analysis based on differential gene expression unveiled known and novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s of all main cardiac cell types. Based on differential gene expression, we could identify multiple subpopulations within a certain cell type. Furthermore, applying single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and injured heart indicated the presence of disease-specific cell subpopulations. As such, we identified cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 as a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> for activated fibroblasts that positively correlates with known myofibroblast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s in both mouse and human cardiac tissue. Cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 inhibition in activated fibroblasts treated with transforming growth factor β triggered a greater increase in the expression of genes related to activated fibroblasts compared with control, suggesting a role of cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 in modulating fibroblast activation in the injured heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and diseased adult heart allows us to study transcriptomic differences between cardiac cells, as well as cell type-specific changes in gene expression during cardiac disease. This new approach provides a wealth of novel insights into molecular changes that underlie the cellular processes relevant for cardiac biology and pathophysiology. Applying this technology could lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets relevant for heart disease.</p></sec>

Genetic and Functional Profiling of CD16-Dependent Natural Killer Activation Identifies Patients at Higher Risk of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an effective therapy for end-stage heart failure. Because cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of late mortality after heart transplant (HT), there is a need to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s that reflect inflammatory or cytotoxic immune mechanisms contributing to its onset. Noninvasive and early stratification of patients at risk remains a challenge for adapting individualized therapy. The CD16 (Fc-gamma receptor 3A [FCGR3A]) receptor was recently identified as a major determinant of antibody-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation in HT biopsies; however, little is known about the role of CD16 in promoting allograft vasculopathy. This study aimed to investigate whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s that reflect CD16-dependent circulating NK cell activation may identify patients at higher risk of developing CAV after HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Blood samples were collected from 103 patients undergoing routine coronarography angiography for CAV diagnosis (median 5 years since HT). Genomic and phenotypic analyses of FCGR3A/CD16 Fc-receptor profiles were compared in CAV-positive (n=52) and CAV-free patients (n=51). The levels of CD16 expression and rituximab-dependent cell cytotoxic activity of peripheral NK cells in HT recipients were evaluated using a noninvasive NK-cellular humoral activation test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enhanced levels of CD16 expression and antibody-dependent NK cell cytotoxic function of HT recipients were associated with the FCGR3A-VV genotype. The frequency of the FCGR3A-VV genotype was significantly higher in the CAV<sup>+</sup> group (odds ratio, 3.9; <i>P</i>=0.0317) than in the CAV<sup>-</sup> group. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was identified as an independent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> correlated with the presence of CAV at the time of coronary angiography by using multivariate logistic regression models. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was also identified as a baseline-independent predictor of CAV risk (odds ratio, 4.7; <i>P</i>=0.023).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study unravels a prominent role for the CD16-dependent NK cell activation pathway in the complex array of factors that favor the progression of transplant arteriosclerosis. It highlights the clinical potential of a noninvasive evaluation of FCGR3A/CD16 in the early stratification of CAV risk. The recognition of CD16 as a major checkpoint that controls immune surveillance may promote the design of individualized NK cell–targeted therapies to limit vascular damage in highly responsive sensitized patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Human Plasma Thioredoxin-80 Increases With Age and in ApoE<sup>−/−</sup> Mice Induces Inflammation, Angiogenesis, and Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thioredoxin (TRX)-1, a ubiquitous 12-kDa protein, exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In contrast, the truncated form, called TRX80, produced by macrophages induces upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. TRX80 also promotes the differentiation of mouse peritoneal and human macrophages toward a proinflammatory M1 phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>TRX1 and TRX80 plasma levels were determined with a specific ELISA. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein (ADAM)-10, ADAM-17, and ADAM-10 activities were measured with SensoLyte 520 ADAM10 Activity Assay Kit, Fluorimetric, and InnoZyme TACE Activity Kit, respectively. Western immunoblots were performed with specific antibodies to ADAM-10 or ADAM-17. Angiogenesis study was evaluated in vitro with human microvascular endothelial cells-1 and in vivo with the Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay in mice. The expression of macrophage phenotype <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s was investigated with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Phosphorylation of Akt, mechanistic target of rapamycin, and 70S6K was determined with specific antibodies. The effect of TRX80 on NLRP3 inflammasome activity was evaluated by measuring the level of interleukin-1β and -18 in the supernatants of activated macrophages with ELISA. Hearts were used for lesion surface evaluation and immunohistochemical studies, and whole descending aorta were stained with Oil Red O. For transgenic mice generation, the human scavenger receptor (SR-A) promoter/enhancer was used to drive macrophage-specific expression of human TRX80 in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In this study, we observed a significant increase of plasma levels of TRX80 in old subjects compared with healthy young subjects. In parallel, an increase in expression and activity of ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 in old peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with those of young subjects was observed. Furthermore, TRX80 was found to colocalize with tumor necrosis factor-α, a macrophage M1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>, in human atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, TRX80 induced the expression of murine M1 macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s through Akt2/mechanistic target of rapamycin–C1/70S6K pathway and activated the inflammasome NLRP3, leading to the release of interleukin-1β and -18, potent atherogenic cytokines. Moreover, TRX80 exerts a powerful angiogenic effect in both in vitro and in vivo mouse studies. Finally, transgenic mice that overexpress human TRX80 specifically in macrophages of apoE<sup>−/−</sup> mice have a significant increase of aortic atherosclerotic lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>TRX80 showed an age-dependent increase in human plasma. In mouse models, TRX80 was associated with a proinflammatory status and increased atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

Gene expression profiles of brain endothelial cells during embryonic development at bulk and single-cell levels
<p>The blood-brain barrier is a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the circulatory system, and it is formed by highly specialized endothelial cells. To explore the molecular mechanisms defining the unique nature of vascular development and differentiation in the brain, we generated high-resolution gene expression profiles of mouse embryonic brain endothelial cells using translating ribosome affinity purification and single-cell RNA sequencing. We compared the brain vascular translatome with the vascular translatomes of other organs and analyzed the vascular translatomes of the brain at different time points during embryonic development. Because canonical Wnt signaling is implicated in the formation of the blood-brain barrier, we also compared the brain endothelial translatome of wild-type mice with that of mice lacking the transcriptional cofactor β-catenin (<i>Ctnnb1</i>). Our analysis revealed extensive molecular changes during the embryonic development of the brain endothelium. We identified genes encoding brain endothelium–specific transcription factors (<i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxl2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, <i>Zfp551</i>, and <i>Zic3</i>) that are associated with maturation of the blood-brain barrier and act downstream of the Wnt–β-catenin signaling pathway. Profiling of individual brain endothelial cells revealed substantial heterogeneity in the population. Nevertheless, the high abundance of <i>Foxf2</i>, <i>Foxq1</i>, <i>Ppard</i>, or <i>Zic3</i> transcripts correlated with the increased expression of genes encoding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s of brain endothelial cell differentiation. Expression of <i>Foxf2</i> and <i>Zic3</i> in human umbilical vein endothelial cells induced the production of blood-brain barrier differentiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s. This comprehensive data set may help to improve the engineering of in vitro blood-brain barrier models.</p>

The target landscape of clinical kinase drugs
<p>Kinase inhibitors are important cancer therapeutics. Polypharmacology is commonly observed, requiring thorough target deconvolution to understand drug mechanism of action. Using chemical proteomics, we analyzed the target spectrum of 243 clinically evaluated kinase drugs. The data revealed previously unknown targets for established drugs, offered a perspective on the “druggable” kinome, highlighted (non)kinase off-targets, and suggested potential therapeutic applications. Integration of phosphoproteomic data refined drug-affected pathways, identified response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s, and strengthened rationale for combination treatments. We exemplify translational value by discovering SIK2 (salt-inducible kinase 2) inhibitors that modulate cytokine production in primary cells, by identifying drugs against the lung cancer survival <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase), and by repurposing cabozantinib to treat FLT3-ITD–positive acute myeloid leukemia.

Tumor aneuploidy correlates with markers of immune evasion and with reduced response to immunotherapy
<p>Immunotherapies based on immune checkpoint blockade are highly effective in a subset of patients. An ongoing challenge is the identification of bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s that predict which patients will benefit from these therapies. Aneuploidy, also known as somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), is widespread in cancer and is posited to drive tumorigenesis. Analyzing 12 human cancer types, we find that, for most, highly aneuploid tumors show reduced expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s of cytotoxic infiltrating immune cells, especially CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and increased expression of cell proliferation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s. Different types of SCNAs predict the proliferation and immune signatures, implying distinct underlying mechanisms. Using published data from two clinical trials of immune checkpoint blockade therapy for metastatic melanoma, we found that tumor aneuploidy inversely correlates with patient survival. Together with other tumor characteristics such as tumor mutational load, aneuploidy may thus help identify patients most likely to respond to immunotherapy.</p>

The Coiled-Coil NLR <i>Rph1</i>, Confers Leaf Rust Resistance in Barley Cultivar Sudan
<p>Unraveling and exploiting mechanisms of disease resistance in cereal crops is currently limited by their large repeat-rich genomes and the lack of genetic recombination or cultivar (cv)-specific sequence information. We cloned the first leaf rust resistance gene <i>Rph1</i> (<i>Rph1</i>.<i>a</i>) from cultivated barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) using “MutChromSeq,” a recently developed molecular genomics tool for the rapid cloning of genes in plants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped <i>Rph1</i> to the short arm of chromosome 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the barley cv Morex reference assembly. A sodium azide mutant population in cv Sudan was generated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H chromosomes from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were sequenced and compared to identify candidate genes for the <i>Rph1</i> locus. MutChromSeq identified a single gene candidate encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger sequencing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate gene. Phylogenetic analysis determined that <i>Rph1</i> clustered separately from all previously cloned NLRs from the Triticeae and displayed highest sequence similarity (89%) with a homolog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) disease resistance protein 1 protein in <i>Triticum urartu</i>. In this study we determined the molecular basis for <i>Rph1</i>-mediated resistance in cultivated barley enabling varietal improvement through diagnostic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> design, gene editing, and gene stacking technologies.</p>

CLASP Facilitates Transitions between Cortical Microtubule Array Patterns
<p>Acentrosomal plant microtubule arrays form patterns at the cell cortex that influence cellular morphogenesis by templating the deposition of cell wall materials, but the molecular basis by which the microtubules form the cortical array patterns remains largely unknown. Loss of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) microtubule-associated protein, CYTOPLASMIC LINKER ASSOCIATED PROTEIN (AtCLASP), results in cellular growth anisotropy defects in hypocotyl cells. We examined the microtubule array patterning in <i>atclasp-1</i> null mutants and discovered a significant defect in the timing of transitions between array patterns but no substantive defect in the array patterns per se. Detailed analysis and computational modeling of the microtubule dynamics in two <i>atclasp-1</i> fluorescent tubulin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> lines revealed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>-dependent effects on depolymerization and catastrophe frequency predicted to alter the steady-state microtubule population. Quantitative in vivo analysis of the underlying microtubule array architecture showed that AtCLASP is required to maintain the number of growing microtubule plus ends during transitions between array patterns. We propose that AtCLASP plays a critical role in cellular morphogenesis through actions on new microtubules that facilitate array transitions.</p>

Identification of Functional Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Affecting Leaf Hair Number in <i>Brassica rapa</i>
<p>Leaf traits affect plant agronomic performance; for example, leaf hair number provides a morphological indicator of drought and insect resistance. <i>Brassica rapa</i> crops have diverse phenotypes, and many <i>B. rapa</i> single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified and used as molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s for plant breeding. However, which SNPs are functional for leaf hair traits and, therefore, effective for breeding purposes remains unknown. Here, we identify a set of SNPs in the <i>B. rapa</i> ssp. <i>pekinenesis</i> candidate gene <i>BrpHAIRY LEAVES1</i> (<i>BrpHL1</i>) and a number of SNPs of <i>BrpHL1</i> in a natural population of 210 <i>B. rapa</i> accessions that have hairy, margin-only hairy, and hairless leaves. <i>BrpHL1</i> genes and their orthologs and paralogs have many SNPs. By intensive mutagenesis and genetic transformation, we selected the functional SNPs for leaf hairs by the exclusion of nonfunctional SNPs and the orthologous and paralogous genes. The residue tryptophan-92 of BrpHL1a was essential for direct interaction with GLABROUS3 and, thus, necessary for the formation of leaf hairs. The accessions with the functional SNP leading to substitution of the tryptophan-92 residue had hairless leaves. The orthologous <i>BrcHL1b</i> from <i>B. rapa</i> ssp. <i>chinensis</i> regulates hair formation on leaf margins rather than leaf surfaces. The selected SNP for the hairy phenotype could be adopted as a molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> for insect resistance in <i>Brassica</i> spp. crops. Moreover, the procedures optimized here can be used to explain the molecular mechanisms of natural variation and to facilitate the molecular breeding of many crops.</p>

The Phosphate Fast-Responsive Genes <i>PECP1</i> and <i>PPsPase1</i> Affect Phosphocholine and Phosphoethanolamine Content<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Phosphate starvation-mediated induction of the HAD-type phosphatases PPsPase1 (AT1G73010) and PECP1 (AT1G17710) has been reported in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, little is known about their in vivo function or impact on plant responses to nutrient deficiency. The preferences of PPsPase1 and PECP1 for different substrates have been studied in vitro but require confirmation in planta. Here, we examined the in vivo function of both enzymes using a reverse genetics approach. We demonstrated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 affect plant phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine content, but not the pyrophosphate-related phenotypes. These observations suggest that the enzymes play a similar role in planta related to the recycling of polar heads from membrane lipids that is triggered during phosphate starvation. Altering the expression of the genes encoding these enzymes had no effect on lipid composition, possibly due to compensation by other lipid recycling pathways triggered during phosphate starvation. Furthermore, our results indicated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 do not influence phosphate homeostasis, since the inactivation of these genes had no effect on phosphate content or on the induction of molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s related to phosphate starvation. A combination of transcriptomics and imaging analyses revealed that PPsPase1 and PECP1 display a highly dynamic expression pattern that closely mirrors the phosphate status. This temporal dynamism, combined with the wide range of induction levels, broad expression, and lack of a direct effect on Pi content and regulation, makes PPsPase1 and PECP1 useful molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s of the phosphate starvation response.</p>

Ontogenetic expression of metabolic genes and microRNAs in rainbow trout alevins during the transition from the endogenous to the exogenous feeding period
<p>As oviparous fish, rainbow trout change their nutritional strategy during ontogenesis. This change is divided into the exclusive utilization of yolk-sac reserves (endogenous feeding), the concurrent utilization of yolk reserves and exogenous feeds (mixed feeding) and the complete dependence on external feeds (exogenous feeding). The change in food source is accompanied by well-characterized morphological changes, including the development of adipose tissue as an energy storage site, and continuous muscle development to improve foraging. The aim of this study was to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to these ontogenetic changes between the nutritional phenotypes in rainbow trout alevins. We therefore analyzed the expression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> genes of metabolic pathways and microRNAs (miRNAs) important in the differentiation and/or maintenance of metabolic tissues. In exogenously feeding alevins, the last enzyme involved in glucose production (<i>g6pca</i> and <i>g6pcb</i>) and lipolytic gene expression (<i>cpt1a</i> and <i>cpt1b</i>) decreased, while that of <i>gk</i>, involved in hepatic glucose use, was induced. This pattern is consistent with a progressive switch from the utilization of stored (gluconeogenic) amino acids and lipids in endogenously feeding alevins to a utilization of exogenous feeds <i>via</i> the glycolytic pathway. A shift towards the utilization of external feeds is further evidenced by the increased expression of <i>omy-miRNA-143</i>, a homologue of the mammalian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> of adipogenesis. The expression of its predicted target gene <i>abhd5</i>, a factor in triglyceride hydrolysis, decreased concurrently, suggesting a potential mechanism in the onset of lipid deposition. Muscle-specific <i>omy-miRNA-1/133</i> and <i>myod1</i> expression decreased in exogenously feeding alevins, a molecular signature consistent with muscle hypertrophy, which may be linked to nutritional cues or increased foraging.</p>

Olfactomedin-1 activity identifies a cell invasion checkpoint during epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the chick embryonic heart
<p>Endothelia in the atrioventricular (AV) canal of the developing heart undergo a prototypical epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) to begin heart valve formation. Using an <i>in vitro</i> invasion assay, an extracellular matrix protein, Olfactomedin-1 (OLFM1), was found to increase mesenchymal cell numbers in AV canals from embryonic chick hearts. Treatment with both anti-OLFM1 antibody and siRNA targeting OLFM1 inhibits mesenchymal cell formation. OLFM1 does not alter cell proliferation, migration or apoptosis. Dispersion, but lack of invasion in the presence of inhibiting antibody, identifies a specific role for OLFM1 in cell invasion during EMT. This role is conserved in other epithelia, as OLFM1 similarly enhances invasion by MDCK epithelial cells in a transwell assay. Synergy is observed when TGFβ2 and OLFM1 are added to MDCK cell cultures, indicating that OLFM-1 activity is cooperative with TGFβ. Inhibition of both OLFM1 and TGFβ in heart invasion assays shows a similar cooperative role during development. To explore OLFM1 activity during EMT, representative EMT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s were examined. Effects of OLFM1 protein and anti-OLFM1 on transcripts of cell-cell adhesion molecules and the transcription factors <i>Snail-1, Snail-2, Twist1</i> and <i>Sox-9</i> argue that OLFM1 does not initiate EMT. Rather, regulation of transcripts of <i>Zeb1</i> and <i>Zeb2</i>, secreted proteases and mesenchymal cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s by both OLFM1 and anti-OLFM1 is consistent with regulation of the cell invasion step of EMT. We conclude that OLFM1 is present and necessary during EMT in the embryonic chick heart. Its role in cell invasion and mesenchymal cell gene regulation suggests an invasion checkpoint in EMT where OLFM1 acts to promote cell invasion into the three-dimensional matrix.</p>

Mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate in response to traumatic bone injury in the zebrafish fin and skull
<p>Zebrafish have an unlimited capacity to regenerate bone after fin amputation. In this process, mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate to osteogenic precursor cells and thus represent an important source of newly forming bone. By contrast, differentiated osteoblasts do not appear to contribute to repair of bone injuries in mammals; rather, osteoblasts form anew from mesenchymal stem cells. This raises the question whether osteoblast dedifferentiation is specific to appendage regeneration, a special feature of the lepidotrichia bone of the fish fin, or a process found more generally in fish bone. Here, we show that dedifferentiation of mature osteoblasts is not restricted to fin regeneration after amputation, but also occurs during repair of zebrafish fin fractures and skull injuries. In both models, mature osteoblasts surrounding the injury downregulate the expression of differentiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s, upregulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s of the pre-osteoblast state and become proliferative. Making use of photoconvertible Kaede protein as well as Cre-driven genetic fate mapping, we show that osteoblasts migrate to the site of injury to replace damaged tissue. Our findings suggest a fundamental role for osteoblast dedifferentiation in reparative bone formation in fish and indicate that adult fish osteoblasts display elevated cellular plasticity compared with mammalian bone-forming cells.</p>

SOX17 Regulates Conversion of Human Fibroblasts Into Endothelial Cells and Erythroblasts by Dedifferentiation Into CD34<sup>+</sup> Progenitor Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying the dedifferentiation and lineage conversion of adult human fibroblasts into functional endothelial cells have not yet been fully defined. Furthermore, it is not known whether fibroblast dedifferentiation recapitulates the generation of multipotent progenitors during embryonic development, which give rise to endothelial and hematopoietic cell lineages. Here we established the role of the developmental transcription factor SOX17 in regulating the bilineage conversion of fibroblasts by the generation of intermediate progenitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors were generated after the dedifferentiation of human adult dermal fibroblasts by overexpression of pluripotency transcription factors. Sorted CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were transdifferentiated into induced endothelial cells and induced erythroblasts using lineage-specific growth factors. The therapeutic potential of the generated cells was assessed in an experimental model of myocardial infarction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Induced endothelial cells expressed specific endothelial cell surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s and also exhibited the capacity for cell proliferation and neovascularization. Induced erythroblasts expressed erythroid surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s and formed erythroid colonies. Endothelial lineage conversion was dependent on the upregulation of the developmental transcription factor SOX17, whereas suppression of SOX17 instead directed the cells toward an erythroid fate. Implantation of these human bipotential CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mice resulted in the formation of microvessels derived from human fibroblasts perfused with mouse and human erythrocytes. Endothelial cells generated from human fibroblasts also showed upregulation of telomerase. Cell implantation markedly improved vascularity and cardiac function after myocardial infarction without any evidence of teratoma formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Dedifferentiation of fibroblasts to intermediate CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitors gives rise to endothelial cells and erythroblasts in a SOX17-dependent manner. These findings identify the intermediate CD34<sup>+</sup> progenitor state as a critical bifurcation point, which can be tuned to generate functional blood vessels or erythrocytes and salvage ischemic tissue.</p></sec>

Genome- and Phenome-Wide Analyses of Cardiac Conduction Identifies Markers of Arrhythmia Risk
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>ECG QRS duration, a measure of cardiac intraventricular conduction, varies ≈2-fold in individuals without cardiac disease. Slow conduction may promote re-entrant arrhythmias.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s of QRS duration in 5272 individuals without cardiac disease selected from electronic medical record algorithms at 5 sites in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. The most significant loci were evaluated within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium QRS genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Twenty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 loci, previously described by CHARGE, were replicated in the eMERGE samples; 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were in the chromosome 3 <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>SCN10A</i> loci, where the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were rs1805126 in <i>SCN5A</i> with <i>P</i>=1.2×10<sup>−8</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=2.5×10<sup>−20</sup> (CHARGE) and rs6795970 in <i>SCN10A</i> with <i>P</i>=6×10<sup>−6</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=5×10<sup>−27</sup> (CHARGE). The other loci were in <i>NFIA</i>, near <i>CDKN1A</i>, and near <i>C6orf204.</i> We then performed phenome-wide association studies on variants in these 5 loci in 13859 European Americans to search for diagnoses associated with these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s. Phenome-wide association study identified atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias as the most common associated diagnoses with <i>SCN10A</i> and <i>SCN5A</i> variants. <i>SCN10A</i> variants were also associated with subsequent development of atrial fibrillation and arrhythmia in the original 5272 “heart-healthy” study population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>We conclude that DNA biobanks coupled to electronic medical records not only provide a platform for genome-wide association study but also may allow broad interrogation of the longitudinal incidence of disease associated with genetic variants. The phenome-wide association study approach implicated sodium channel variants modulating QRS duration in subjects without cardiac disease as predictors of subsequent arrhythmias.</p></sec>

A microdevice to locally electroporate embryos with high efficiency and reduced cell damage
<p>The ability to follow and modify cell behaviour with accurate spatiotemporal resolution is a prerequisite to study morphogenesis in developing organisms. Electroporation, the delivery of exogenous molecules into targeted cell populations through electric permeation of the plasma membrane, has been used with this aim in different model systems. However, current localised electroporation strategies suffer from insufficient reproducibility and mediocre survival when applied to small and delicate organisms such as early post-implantation mouse embryos. We introduce here a microdevice to achieve localised electroporation with high efficiency and reduced cell damage. <i>In silico</i> simulations using a simple electrical model of mouse embryos indicated that a dielectric guide-based design would improve on existing alternatives. Such a device was microfabricated and its capacities tested by targeting the distal visceral endoderm (DVE), a migrating cell population essential for anterior-posterior axis establishment. Transfection was efficiently and reproducibly restricted to fewer than four visceral endoderm cells without compromising cell behaviour and embryo survival. Combining targeted mosaic expression of fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s with live imaging in transgenic embryos revealed that, like leading DVE cells, non-leading ones send long basal projections and intercalate during their migration. Finally, we show that the use of our microsystem can be extended to a variety of embryological contexts, from preimplantation stages to organ explants. Hence, we have experimentally validated an approach delivering a tailor-made tool for the study of morphogenesis in the mouse embryo. Furthermore, we have delineated a comprehensive strategy for the development of ad hoc electroporation devices.</p>

WT1 regulates the development of the posterior taste field
<p>Despite the importance of taste in determining nutrient intake, our understanding of the processes that control the development of the peripheral taste system is lacking. Several early regulators of taste development have been identified, including sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 4 and multiple members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulation of these factors, including their induction, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial role for the Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) in circumvallate (CV) papillae development. WT1 is a transcription factor that is important in the normal development of multiple tissues, including both the olfactory and visual systems. In mice, WT1 expression is detectable by E12.5, when the CV taste placode begins to form. In mice lacking WT1, the CV fails to develop normally and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s of early taste development are dysregulated compared with wild type. We demonstrate that expression of the WT1 target genes <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Bmp4</i> is significantly reduced in developing tongue tissue derived from <i>Wt1</i> knockout mice and that, in normal tongue, WT1 is bound to the promoter regions of these genes. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of WT1 in cultured taste cells leads to a reduction in the expression of <i>Lef1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. Our data identify WT1 as a crucial transcription factor in the development of the CV through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways that have established roles in the formation and patterning of taste placodes.</p>

Identification and characterization of putative stem cells in the adult pig ovary
<p>Recently, the concept of ‘neo-oogenesis’ has received increasing attention, since it was shown that adult mammals have a renewable source of eggs. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the origin of these eggs and to confirm whether neo-oogenesis continues throughout life in the ovaries of the adult mammal. Adult female pigs were utilized to isolate, identify and characterize, including their proliferation and differentiation capabilities, putative stem cells (PSCs) from the ovary. PSCs were found to comprise a heterogeneous population based on c-kit expression and cell size, and also express stem and germ cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s. Analysis of PSC molecular progression during establishment showed that these cells undergo cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of Oct4 in a manner reminiscent of gonadal primordial germ cells (PGCs). Hence, cells with the characteristics of early PGCs are present or are generated in the adult pig ovary. Furthermore, the <i>in vitro</i> establishment of porcine PSCs required the presence of ovarian cell-derived extracellular regulatory factors, which are also likely to direct stem cell niche interactions <i>in vivo</i>. In conclusion, the present work supports a crucial role for c-kit and kit ligand/stem cell factor in stimulating the growth, proliferation and nuclear reprogramming of porcine PSCs, and further suggests that porcine PSCs might be the culture equivalent of early PGCs.</p>

Active repression by RARγ signaling is required for vertebrate axial elongation
<p>Retinoic acid receptor gamma 2 (RARγ2) is the major RAR isoform expressed throughout the caudal axial progenitor domain in vertebrates. During a microarray screen to identify RAR targets, we identified a subset of genes that pattern caudal structures or promote axial elongation and are upregulated by increased RAR-mediated repression. Previous studies have suggested that RAR is present in the caudal domain, but is quiescent until its activation in late stage embryos terminates axial elongation. By contrast, we show here that RARγ2 is engaged in all stages of axial elongation, not solely as a terminator of axial growth. In the absence of RA, RARγ2 represses transcriptional activity <i>in vivo</i> and maintains the pool of caudal progenitor cells and presomitic mesoderm. In the presence of RA, RARγ2 serves as an activator, facilitating somite differentiation. Treatment with an RARγ-selective inverse agonist (NRX205099) or overexpression of dominant-negative RARγ increases the expression of posterior Hox genes and that of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> genes for presomitic mesoderm and the chordoneural hinge. Conversely, when RAR-mediated repression is reduced by overexpressing a dominant-negative co-repressor (c-SMRT), a constitutively active RAR (VP16-RARγ2), or by treatment with an RARγ-selective agonist (NRX204647), expression of caudal genes is diminished and extension of the body axis is prematurely terminated. Hence, gene repression mediated by the unliganded RARγ2–co-repressor complex constitutes a novel mechanism to regulate and facilitate the correct expression levels and spatial restriction of key genes that maintain the caudal progenitor pool during axial elongation in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos.</p>

The development of zebrafish tendon and ligament progenitors
<p>Despite the importance of tendons and ligaments for transmitting movement and providing stability to the musculoskeletal system, their development is considerably less well understood than that of the tissues they serve to connect. Zebrafish have been widely used to address questions in muscle and skeletal development, yet few studies describe their tendon and ligament tissues. We have analyzed in zebrafish the expression of several genes known to be enriched in mammalian tendons and ligaments, including <i>scleraxis</i> (<i>scx</i>), <i>collagen 1a2</i> (<i>col1a2</i>) and <i>tenomodulin</i> (<i>tnmd</i>), or in the tendon-like myosepta of the zebrafish (<i>xirp2a</i>). Co-expression studies with muscle and cartilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s demonstrate the presence of <i>scxa</i>, <i>col1a2</i> and <i>tnmd</i> at sites between the developing muscle and cartilage, and <i>xirp2a</i> at the myotendinous junctions. We determined that the zebrafish craniofacial tendon and ligament progenitors are neural crest derived, as in mammals. Cranial and fin tendon progenitors can be induced in the absence of differentiated muscle or cartilage, although neighboring muscle and cartilage are required for tendon cell maintenance and organization, respectively. By contrast, myoseptal <i>scxa</i> expression requires muscle for its initiation. Together, these data suggest a conserved role for muscle in tendon development. Based on the similarities in gene expression, morphology, collagen ultrastructural arrangement and developmental regulation with that of mammalian tendons, we conclude that the zebrafish tendon populations are homologous to their force-transmitting counterparts in higher vertebrates. Within this context, the zebrafish model can be used to provide new avenues for studying tendon biology in a vertebrate genetic system.</p>

Rapid and widespread suppression of self-renewal by microRNA-203 during epidermal differentiation
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in differentiation of stem cells. However, the precise dynamics of miRNA induction during stem cell differentiation have not been visualized and molecular mechanisms through which miRNAs execute their function remain unclear. Using high-resolution <i>in situ</i> hybridization together with cell lineage and proliferation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s in mouse skin, we show that miR-203 is transcriptionally activated in the differentiating daughter cells upon the asymmetric cell division of interfollicular progenitor cells. Once induced, miR-203 rapidly promotes the cell cycle exit within 6 hours and abolishes self-renewal of the progenitor cells. With an inducible mouse model, we identify numerous miR-203 <i>in vivo</i> targets that are highly enriched in regulation of cell cycle and cell division, as well as in response to DNA damage. Importantly, co-suppression of individual targets, including p63, Skp2 and Msi2 by miR-203 is required for its function of promoting the cell cycle exit and inhibiting the long-term proliferation. Together, our findings reveal the rapid and widespread impact of miR-203 on the self-renewal program and provide mechanistic insights into the potent role of miR-203 during the epidermal differentiation. These results should also contribute to understanding the role of miR-203 in the development of skin cancer.</p>

Cardioprotective Role of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells in Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of cells that expand in cancer, inflammation, and infection and negatively regulate inflammation and the immune response. Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome wherein inflammation induction and incomplete resolution can potentially contribute to HF development and progression. However, the role of MDSCs in HF remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The percentage of MDSCs in patients with HF and in mice with pressure overload–induced HF using isoproterenol infusion or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was detected by flow cytometry. The effects of MDSCs on isoproterenol- or TAC-induced HF were observed on depleting MDSCs with 5-fluorouracil (50 mg/kg) or gemcitabine (120 mg/kg), transferring purified MDSCs, or enhancing endogenous MDSCs with rapamycin (2 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup>). Hypertrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s and inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA, real-time polymerase chain reaction, or Western blot. Cardiac functions were determined by echocardiography and hemodynamic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The percentage of human leukocyte antigen-D–related (HLA-DR)<sup>−</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> MDSCs in the blood of patients with HF was significantly increased and positively correlated with disease severity and increased plasma levels of cytokines, including interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and transforming growth factor–β. Furthermore, MDSCs derived from patients with HF inhibited T-cell proliferation and interferon-γ secretion. Similar results were observed in TAC- and isoproterenol-induced HF in mice. Pharmaceutical depletion of MDSCs significantly exacerbated isoproterenol- and TAC-induced pathological cardiac remodeling and inflammation, whereas adoptive transfer of MDSCs prominently rescued isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF. Consistently, administration of rapamycin significantly increased endogenous MDSCs by suppressing their differentiation and improved isoproterenol- and TAC-induced HF, but MDSC depletion mostly blocked beneficial rapamycin-mediated effects. Mechanistically, MDSC-secreted molecules suppressed isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy and proinflammatory gene expression in cardiomyocytes in a coculture system. Neutralization of interleukin-10 blunted both monocytic MDSC- and granulocytic MDSC–mediated anti-inflammatory and antihypertrophic effects, but treatment with a nitric oxide inhibitor only partially blocked the antihypertrophic effect of monocytic MDSCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings revealed a cardioprotective role of MDSCs in HF by their antihypertrophic effects on cardiomyocytes and anti-inflammatory effects through interleukin-10 and nitric oxide. Pharmacological targeting of MDSCs by rapamycin constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy for HF.</p></sec>

Pericardial Adipose Tissue Regulates Granulopoiesis, Fibrosis, and Cardiac Function After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The pericardial adipose tissue (AT) contains a high density of lymphoid clusters.

Murine pericardial lymphoid clusters were visualized in mice subjected to coronary artery ligation. To study the relevance of pericardial clusters during inflammatory responses after MI, we surgically removed the pericardial AT and performed B-cell depletion and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor blockade. Leukocytes in murine hearts, pericardial AT, spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bone marrow were quantified by flow cytometry. Cannabinoid receptor CB2 (CB2<sup>–/–</sup>) mice were used as a model for enhanced B-cell responses. The effect of impaired dendritic cell (DC) trafficking on pericardial AT inflammatory responses was tested in CCR7<sup>–/–</sup> mice subjected to MI. Cardiac fibrosis and ventricular function were assessed by histology and echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified larger B-cell clusters in epicardial AT of human patients with coronary artery disease in comparison with controls without coronary artery disease. Infarcted mice also had larger pericardial clusters and 3-fold upregulated numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor–producing B cells within pericardial AT, but not spleen or lymph nodes. This was associated with higher DC and T-cell counts in pericardial AT, which outnumbered DCs and T cells in lymph nodes. Analysis of DC maturation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s, tracking experiments with fluorescently labeled cells, and use of CCR7-deficient mice suggested that activated DCs migrate from infarcts into pericardial AT via CCR7. B-cell depletion or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor neutralization inhibited DC and T-cell expansion within pericardial AT, and translated into reduced bone marrow granulopoiesis and cardiac neutrophil infiltration 3 days after MI. The relevance of the pericardial AT in mediating all these effects was confirmed by removal of pericardial AT and ex vivo coculture with pericardial AT and granulocyte progenitors. Finally, enhanced fibrosis and worsened ejection fraction in CB2<sup>–/–</sup> mice were limited by pericardial AT removal.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings unveil a new mechanism by which the pericardial AT coordinates immune cell activation, granulopoiesis, and outcome after MI.</p></sec>

Comparison Between Patent Ductus Arteriosus Stent and Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt as Palliation for Infants With Ductal-Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow may undergo palliation with either a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stent or a modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt. A balanced multicenter comparison of these 2 approaches is lacking.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow palliated with either a PDA stent or a BT shunt from January 2008 to November 2015 were reviewed from the 4 member centers of the Congenital Catheterization Research Collaborative. Outcomes were compared by use of propensity score adjustment to account for baseline differences between groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One hundred six patients with a PDA stent and 251 patients with a BT shunt were included. The groups differed in underlying anatomy (expected 2-ventricle circulation in 60% of PDA stents versus 45% of BT shunts; <i>P</i>=0.001) and presence of antegrade pulmonary blood flow (61% of PDA stents versus 38% of BT shunts; <i>P</i><0.001). After propensity score adjustment, there was no difference in the hazard of the primary composite outcome of death or unplanned reintervention to treat cyanosis (hazard ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–1.23; <i>P</i>=0.31). Other reinterventions were more common in the PDA stent group (hazard ratio, 29.8; 95% CI, 9.8–91.1; <i>P</i><0.001). However, the PDA stent group had a lower adjusted intensive care unit length of stay (5.3 days [95% CI, 4.2–6.7] versus 9.19 days [95% CI, 7.9–10.6]; <i>P</i><0.001), a lower risk of diuretic use at discharge (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.25–0.64; <i>P</i><0.001) and procedural complications (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2–0.77; <i>P</i>=0.006), and larger (152 mm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> [95% CI, 132–176] versus 125 mm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup> [95% CI, 113–138]; <i>P</i>=0.029) and more symmetrical (symmetry index, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.8–0.89] versus 0.77 [95% CI, 0.75–0.8]; <i>P</i>=0.008] pulmonary arteries at the time of subsequent surgical repair or last follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this multicenter comparison of palliative PDA stent and BT shunt for infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow adjusted for differences in patient factors, there was no difference in the primary end point, death or unplanned reintervention to treat cyanosis.

Magnitude of Soluble ST2 as a Novel Biomarker for Acute Aortic Dissection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Misdiagnosis of acute aortic dissection (AAD) can lead to significant morbidity and death. Soluble ST2 (sST2) is a cardiovascular injury–related bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>. The extent to which sST2 is elevated in AAD and whether sST2 can discriminate AAD from other causes of sudden-onset severe chest pain are unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We measured plasma concentrations of sST2 (R&D Systems assay) in 1360 patients, including 1027 participants in the retrospective discovery set and 333 patients with initial suspicion of AAD enrolled in the prospective validation cohort. Measures of discrimination for differentiating AAD from other causes of chest pain were calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the acute phase, sST2 levels were higher in patients with AAD than those with either acute myocardial infarction in the first case-control discovery set within 24 hours of symptom onset or with patients with pulmonary embolism in the second discovery set (medians of 129.2 ng/mL versus 14.7 with <i>P</i><0.001 for AAD versus acute myocardial infarction and 88.6 versus 9.3 with <i>P</i><0.001 for AAD versus pulmonary embolism). In the prospective validation set, sST2 was most elevated in patients with AAD (median [25th, 75th percentile]: 76.4 [49.6, 130.3]) and modestly elevated in acute myocardial infarction (25.0 [15.5, 37.2]), pulmonary embolism (14.9 [10.2, 30.1]), and angina patients (21.5 [13.1, 27.6], all <i>P</i><0.001 versus AAD). The area under receiver operating characteristic curve for patients with AAD versus all control patients within 24 hours of presenting at the emergency department was 0.97 (0.95, 0.98) for sST2, 0.91 (0.88, 0.94) for D-dimer, and 0.50 (0.44, 0.56) for cardiac troponin I, respectively. At a cutoff level of 34.6 ng/mL, sST2 had a sensitivity of 99.1%, specificity of 84.9%, positive predictive value of 68.7%, negative predictive value of 99.7%, positive likelihood ratio of 6.6, and negative likelihood ratio of 0.01.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with suspected aortic dissection in the emergency department, sST2 showed superior overall diagnostic performance to D-dimer or cardiac troponin I. Additional study is needed to determine whether sST2 might be a useful rule-out <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> for AAD in the emergency room.</p></sec>

Long-Term Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Women Who Have Had Infants With Heart Defects
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The possibility that congenital heart defects signal a familial predisposition to cardiovascular disease has not been investigated. We aimed to determine whether the risk of cardiovascular disorders later in life was higher for women who have had newborns with congenital heart defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied a cohort of 1 084 251 women who had delivered infants between 1989 and 2013 in Quebec, Canada. We identified women whose infants had critical, noncritical, or no heart defects, and tracked the women over time for future hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease, with follow-up extending up to 25 years past pregnancy. We calculated the incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization per 1000 person-years, and used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between infant heart defects and risk of maternal cardiovascular hospitalization. Models were adjusted for age, parity, preeclampsia, comorbidity, material deprivation, and time period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Women whose infants had heart defects had a higher overall incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization. There were 3.38 cardiovascular hospitalizations per 1000 person-years for those with critical defects (95% CI, 2.67–4.27), 3.19 for noncritical defects (95% CI, 2.96–3.45), and 2.42 for no heart defects (95% CI, 2.39–2.44). In comparison with no heart defects, women whose infants had critical defects had a hazard ratio of 1.43 (95% CI, 1.13–1.82) for any cardiovascular hospitalization, and women whose infants had noncritical defects had a hazard ratio of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.15–1.34), in adjusted models. Risks of specific causes of cardiovascular hospitalization, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, and other atherosclerotic disorders, were also greater for mothers of infants with congenital heart defects than with no defects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Women whose infants have congenital heart defects have a greater risk of cardiovascular hospitalization later in life. Congenital heart defects in offspring may be an early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> of predisposition to cardiovascular disease.</p></sec>

miR-22 Is a Novel Mediator of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Modulation and Neointima Formation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>MicroRNA-22 (miR-22) has recently been reported to play a regulatory role during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from stem cells, but little is known about its target genes and related pathways in mature VSMC phenotypic modulation or its clinical implication in neointima formation following vascular injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a wire-injury mouse model, and local delivery of AgomiR-22 or miR-22 inhibitor, as well, to explore the therapeutic potential of miR-22 in vascular diseases. Furthermore, normal and diseased human femoral arteries were harvested, and various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models of VSMC phenotype switching were conducted to examine miR-22 expression during VSMC phenotype switching.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Expression of miR-22 was closely regulated during VSMC phenotypic modulation. miR-22 overexpression significantly increased expression of VSMC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> genes and inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, whereas the opposite effect was observed when endogenous miR-22 was knocked down. As expected, 2 previously reported miR-22 target genes, MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and histone deacetylase 4, exhibited a regulatory role in VSMC phenotypic modulation. A transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein, EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 protein homolog), has been identified as a novel miR-22 target gene in VSMC phenotypic modulation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of miR-22 in the injured vessels significantly reduced the expression of its target genes, decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries, whereas the opposite effect was observed with local application of a miR-22 inhibitor to injured arteries. We next examined the clinical relevance of miR-22 expression and its target genes in human femoral arteries. We found that miR-22 expression was significantly reduced, whereas MECP2 and EVI1 expression levels were dramatically increased, in diseased in comparison with healthy femoral human arteries. This inverse relationship between miR-22 and MECP2 and EVI1 was evident in both healthy and diseased human femoral arteries.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data demonstrate that miR-22 and EVI1 are novel regulators of VSMC function, specifically during neointima hyperplasia, offering a novel therapeutic opportunity for treating vascular diseases.</p></sec>

Functional Metabolomics Characterizes a Key Role for <i>N</i>-Acetylneuraminic Acid in Coronary Artery Diseases
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>As new bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s of coronary artery diseases (CAD) emerge via metabolomics, the underlying functional mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Functional metabolomics aims to translate metabolomics-derived bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s to disease mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A cohort of 2324 patients who underwent coronary angiography from 4 independent centers was studied. A combination of ultra–performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode was used for untargeted analysis of metabolites in plasma. Significant differential metabolites were identified by cross-comparisons with and within CAD types, including normal coronary artery, nonobstructvie coronary atherosclerosis, stable angina, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction. A tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry–based approach using isotope-labeled standard addition was subsequently performed for targeted analysis of the metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> <i>N</i>-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). A functional metabolomics strategy was proposed to investigate the role of Neu5Ac in the progression of CAD by using in vitro and in vivo models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified a total of 36 differential metabolites, 35 of which were confirmed with reference compounds. Elevation of Neu5Ac was observed in plasma during CAD progression in center 1 (<i>P</i>=4.0e-64, n=2019) and replicated in 3 independent centers (n=305). The increased level of Neu5Ac in plasma was confirmed by accurate targeted quantification. Mechanistically, Neu5Ac was able to trigger myocardial injury in vitro and in vivo by activation of the Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase signaling pathway through binding to RhoA and Cdc42, but not Rac1. Silencing neuraminidase-1, the enzyme that regulates Neu5Ac generation, ameliorated oxygen-glucose deprivation–induced injury in cardiomyocytes and ligation/isoprenaline-induced myocardial ischemia injury in rats. Pharmacological inhibition of neuraminidase by anti-influenza drugs, oseltamivir and zanamivir, also protected cardiomyocytes and the heart from myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Functional metabolomics identified a key role for Neu5Ac in acute myocardial infarction, and targeting neuraminidase-1 may represent an unrecognized therapeutic intervention for CAD.</p></sec>

Effect of Distinct Lifestyle Interventions on Mobilization of Fat Storage Pools
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We aimed to assess whether distinct lifestyle strategies can differentially affect specific body adipose depots.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed an 18-month randomized controlled trial among 278 sedentary adults with abdominal obesity (75%) or dyslipidemia in an isolated workplace with a monitored provided lunch. Participants were randomized to isocaloric low-fat or Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate (MED/LC) diet+28 g walnuts/day with/without added moderate physical activity (PA; 80% aerobic; supervised/free gym membership). Overall primary outcome was body fat redistribution, and the main specific end point was visceral adipose tissue (VAT). We further followed the dynamics of different fat depots (deep and superficial subcutaneous, liver, pericardial, muscle, pancreas, and renal sinus) by magnetic resonance imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 278 participants (age, 48 years, 89% men, body mass index, 30.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), 86% completed the trial with good adherence. The low-fat group preferentially decreased reported fat intake (−21.0% versus −11.5% for the MED/LC; <i>P</i><0.001), and the MED/LC group decreased reported carbohydrates intake (−39.5% versus −21.3% for the low-fat group; <i>P</i><0.001). The PA<sup>+</sup> groups significantly increased the metabolic equivalents per week versus the PA<sup>−</sup> groups (19.0 versus 2.1; <i>P</i>=0.009). Whereas final moderate weight loss was indifferent, exercise attenuated the waist circumference rebound with the greatest effect in the MED/LC<sup>PA+</sup> group (<i>P</i><0.05). VAT (−22%), intrahepatic (−29%), and intrapericardial (−11%) fats declines were higher than pancreatic and femur intermuscular fats (1% to 2%) loss. Independent of weight loss, PA<sup>+</sup> with either diet had a significantly greater effect on decreasing VAT (mean of difference, −6.67cm<sup>2</sup>; 95% confidence interval, −14.8 to −0.45) compared with PA<sup>−</sup>. The MED/LC diet was superior to the low-fat diet in decreasing intrahepatic, intrapericardial, and pancreatic fats (<i>P</i><0.05 for all). In contrast, renal sinus and femoral intermuscular fats were not differentially altered by lifestyle interventions but by weight loss per se. In multivariate models further adjusted for weight loss, losing VAT or intrahepatic fat was independently associated with improved lipid profile, losing deep subcutaneous adipose tissue with improved insulin sensitivity, and losing superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue remained neutral except for an association with decreased leptin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Moderate weight loss alone inadequately reflects the significant lifestyle effects on atherogenic and diabetogenic fat depots. The MED/LC diet mobilizes specific ectopic fat depots, and exercise has an independent contribution to VAT loss. Fat depots exhibit diverse responsiveness and are differentially related to cardiometabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s. Distinct lifestyle protocols may uniquely induce fat mobilization from specific anatomic sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

The primary outcome was the difference in body weight, body mass index, and fat mass changes between the 2 groups. Secondary outcomes were differences in circulating cardiovascular disease risk parameters changes between the 2 groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One hundred eighteen subjects (mean age: 51.1 years, females: 78%) were enrolled. The total participation rate at the end of the study was 84.7%. No differences between the 2 diets in body weight were observed, as reported by similar and significant reductions obtained by both V<sc>d</sc> (−1.88 kg) and MD (−1.77 kg).

Dedifferentiation, Proliferation, and Redifferentiation of Adult Mammalian Cardiomyocytes After Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Adult mammalian hearts have a limited ability to generate new cardiomyocytes. Proliferation of existing adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs) is a potential source of new cardiomyocytes. Understanding the fundamental biology of ACM proliferation could be of great clinical significance for treating myocardial infarction (MI). We aim to understand the process and regulation of ACM proliferation and its role in new cardiomyocyte formation of post-MI mouse hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>β-Actin-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice and fate-mapping Myh6-MerCreMer-tdTomato/lacZ mice were used to trace the fate of ACMs. In a coculture system with neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, ACM proliferation was documented with clear evidence of cytokinesis observed with time-lapse imaging. Cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult mouse post-MI heart was detected by cell cycle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s and 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine incorporation analysis. Echocardiography was used to measure cardiac function, and histology was performed to determine infarction size.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vitro, mononucleated and bi/multinucleated ACMs were able to proliferate at a similar rate (7.0%) in the coculture. Dedifferentiation proceeded ACM proliferation, which was followed by redifferentiation. Redifferentiation was essential to endow the daughter cells with cardiomyocyte contractile function. Intercellular propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from contracting neonatal rat ventricular myocytes into ACM daughter cells was required to activate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T-cell signaling pathway to induce ACM redifferentiation. The properties of neonatal rat ventricular myocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients influenced the rate of ACM redifferentiation. Hypoxia impaired the function of gap junctions by dephosphorylating its component protein connexin 43, the major mediator of intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation between cardiomyocytes, thereby impairing ACM redifferentiation. In vivo, ACM proliferation was found primarily in the MI border zone. An ischemia-resistant connexin 43 mutant enhanced the redifferentiation of ACM-derived new cardiomyocytes after MI and improved cardiac function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Mature ACMs can reenter the cell cycle and form new cardiomyocytes through a 3-step process: dedifferentiation, proliferation, and redifferentiation. Intercellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal from neighboring functioning cardiomyocytes through gap junctions induces the redifferentiation process. This novel mechanism contributes to new cardiomyocyte formation in post-MI hearts in mammals.</p></sec>

Vascular CXCR4 Limits Atherosclerosis by Maintaining Arterial Integrity
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine ligand/receptor axis controls (progenitor) cell homeostasis and trafficking. So far, an atheroprotective role of CXCL12/CXCR4 has only been implied through pharmacological intervention, in particular, because the somatic deletion of the <i>CXCR4</i> gene in mice is embryonically lethal. Moreover, cell-specific effects of CXCR4 in the arterial wall and underlying mechanisms remain elusive, prompting us to investigate the relevance of CXCR4 in vascular cell types for atheroprotection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined the role of vascular CXCR4 in atherosclerosis and plaque composition by inducing an endothelial cell (BmxCreER<sup>T2</sup>-driven)–specific or smooth muscle cell (SMC, SmmhcCreER<sup>T2</sup>- or TaglnCre-driven)–specific deficiency of <i>CXCR4</i> in an apolipoprotein E–deficient mouse model. To identify underlying mechanisms for effects of CXCR4, we studied endothelial permeability, intravital leukocyte adhesion, involvement of the Akt/WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and relevant phosphatases in VE-cadherin expression and function, vascular tone in aortic rings, cholesterol efflux from macrophages, and expression of SMC phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s. Finally, we analyzed associations of common genetic variants at the <i>CXCR4</i> locus with the risk for coronary heart disease, along with <i>CXCR4</i> transcript expression in human atherosclerotic plaques.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The cell-specific deletion of <i>CXCR4</i> in arterial endothelial cells (n=12–15) or SMCs (n=13–24) markedly increased atherosclerotic lesion formation in hyperlipidemic mice. Endothelial barrier function was promoted by CXCL12/CXCR4, which triggered Akt/WNT/β-catenin signaling to drive VE-cadherin expression and stabilized junctional VE-cadherin complexes through associated phosphatases. Conversely, endothelial <i>CXCR4</i> deficiency caused arterial leakage and inflammatory leukocyte recruitment during atherogenesis. In arterial SMCs, CXCR4 sustained normal vascular reactivity and contractile responses, whereas <i>CXCR4</i> deficiency favored a synthetic phenotype, the occurrence of macrophage-like SMCs in the lesions, and impaired cholesterol efflux. Regression analyses in humans (n=259 796) identified the C-allele at <i>rs2322864</i> within the <i>CXCR4</i> locus to be associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease. In line, C/C risk genotype carriers showed reduced CXCR4 expression in carotid artery plaques (n=188), which was furthermore associated with symptomatic disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data clearly establish that vascular CXCR4 limits atherosclerosis by maintaining arterial integrity, preserving endothelial barrier function, and a normal contractile SMC phenotype. Enhancing these beneficial functions of arterial CXCR4 by selective modulators might open novel therapeutic options in atherosclerosis.</p></sec>

A multivariable hierarchical logistic regression model to identify patient and procedural characteristics predictive of a major adverse event or death after cardiac catheterization was derived in 70% of the cohort and validated in the remaining 30%.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rate of major adverse event or death was 7.1% and 7.2% in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Six procedure-type risk categories and 6 independent indicators of hemodynamic vulnerability were identified.

The model had good discrimination, with a C-statistic of 0.76 and 0.75 in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Model calibration in the validation cohort was excellent, with a slope of 0.97 (standard error, 0.04; <i>P</i> value [for difference from 1] =0.53) and an intercept of 0.007 (standard error, 0.12; <i>P</i> value [for difference from 0] =0.95).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The creation of a validated risk-standardization model for adverse outcomes after congenital cardiac catheterization can support reporting of risk-adjusted outcomes in the IMPACT Registry as a foundation for quality improvement.</p></sec>

Disturbed Placental Imprinting in Preeclampsia Leads to Altered Expression of DLX5, a Human-Specific Early Trophoblast Marker
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Preeclampsia is a complex and common human-specific pregnancy syndrome associated with placental pathology. The human specificity provides both intellectual and methodological challenges, lacking a robust model system. Given the role of imprinted genes in human placentation and the vulnerability of imprinted genes to loss of imprinting changes, there has been extensive speculation, but no robust evidence, that imprinted genes are involved in preeclampsia. Our study aims to investigate whether disturbed imprinting contributes to preeclampsia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We first aimed to confirm that preeclampsia is a disease of the placenta by generating and analyzing genome-wide molecular data on well-characterized patient material. We performed high-throughput transcriptome analyses of multiple placenta samples from healthy controls and patients with preeclampsia. Next, we identified differentially expressed genes in preeclamptic placentas and intersected them with the list of human imprinted genes. We used bioinformatics/statistical analyses to confirm association between imprinting and preeclampsia and to predict biological processes affected in preeclampsia. Validation included epigenetic and cellular assays. In terms of human specificity, we established an in vitro invasion-differentiation trophoblast model. Our comparative phylogenetic analysis involved single-cell transcriptome data of human, macaque, and mouse preimplantation embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found disturbed placental imprinting in preeclampsia and revealed potential candidates, including <i>GATA3</i> and <i>DLX5</i>, with poorly explored imprinted status and no prior association with preeclampsia. As a result of loss of imprinting, <i>DLX5</i> was upregulated in 69% of preeclamptic placentas. Levels of <i>DLX5</i> correlated with classic preeclampsia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s. DLX5 is expressed in human but not in murine trophoblast. The DLX5<sup>high</sup> phenotype resulted in reduced proliferation, increased metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum stress-response activation in trophoblasts in vitro. The transcriptional profile of such cells mimics the transcriptome of preeclamptic placentas. Pan-mammalian comparative analysis identified <i>DLX5</i> as part of the human-specific regulatory network of trophoblast differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis provides evidence of a true association among disturbed imprinting, gene expression, and preeclampsia. As a result of disturbed imprinting, the upregulated <i>DLX5</i> affects trophoblast proliferation. Our in vitro model might fill a vital niche in preeclampsia research. Human-specific regulatory circuitry of <i>DLX5</i> might help explain certain aspects of preeclampsia.</p></sec>

Tomo-Seq Identifies SOX9 as a Key Regulator of Cardiac Fibrosis During Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac ischemic injury induces a pathological remodeling response, which can ultimately lead to heart failure. Detailed mechanistic insights into molecular signaling pathways relevant for different aspects of cardiac remodeling will support the identification of novel therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Although genome-wide transcriptome analysis on diseased tissues has greatly advanced our understanding of the regulatory networks that drive pathological changes in the heart, this approach has been disadvantaged by the fact that the signals are derived from tissue homogenates. Here we used tomo-seq to obtain a genome-wide gene expression signature with high spatial resolution spanning from the infarcted area to the remote to identify new regulators of cardiac remodeling. Cardiac tissue samples from patients suffering from ischemic heart disease were used to validate our findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Tracing transcriptional differences with a high spatial resolution across the infarcted heart enabled us to identify gene clusters that share a comparable expression profile. The spatial distribution patterns indicated a separation of expressional changes for genes involved in specific aspects of cardiac remodeling, such as fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and calcium handling (<i>Col1a2</i>, <i>Nppa</i>, and <i>Serca2</i>). Subsequent correlation analysis allowed for the identification of novel factors that share a comparable transcriptional regulation pattern across the infarcted tissue. The strong correlation between the expression levels of these known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> genes and the expression of the coregulated genes could be confirmed in human ischemic cardiac tissue samples. Follow-up analysis identified SOX9 as common transcriptional regulator of a large portion of the fibrosis-related genes that become activated under conditions of ischemic injury. Lineage-tracing experiments indicated that the majority of COL1-positive fibroblasts stem from a pool of SOX9-expressing cells, and in vivo loss of <i>Sox9</i> blunted the cardiac fibrotic response on ischemic injury. The colocalization between SOX9 and COL1 could also be confirmed in patients suffering from ischemic heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Based on the exact local expression cues, tomo-seq can serve to reveal novel genes and key transcription factors involved in specific aspects of cardiac remodeling. Using tomo-seq, we were able to unveil the unknown relevance of SOX9 as a key regulator of cardiac fibrosis, pointing to SOX9 as a potential therapeutic target for cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec>

Pericarditis as a Marker of Occult Cancer and a Prognostic Factor for Cancer Mortality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pericarditis may be a serious complication of malignancy. Its significance as a first symptom of occult cancer and as a prognostic factor for cancer survival is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using Danish medical databases, we conducted a nationwide cohort study of all patients with a first-time diagnosis of pericarditis during 1994 to 2013. We excluded patients with previous cancer and followed up the remaining patients for subsequent cancer diagnosis until November 30, 2013. We calculated risks and standardized incidence ratios of cancer for patients with pericarditis compared with the general population. We assessed whether pericarditis predicts cancer survival by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression using a matched comparison cohort of cancer patients without pericarditis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 13 759 patients with acute pericarditis, 1550 subsequently were diagnosed with cancer during follow-up. The overall cancer standardized incidence ratio was 1.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–1.5), driven predominantly by increased rates of lung, kidney, and bladder cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, and unspecified metastatic cancer. The <3-month cancer risk among patients with pericarditis was 2.7%, and the standardized incidence ratio was 12.4 (95% CI, 11.2–13.7). The 3- to <12-month standardized incidence ratio of cancer was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2–1.7), subsequently decreasing to 1.1 (95% CI, 1.0–1.2). Three-month survival after the cancer diagnosis was 80% and 86% among those with and without pericarditis, respectively, and the hazard ratio was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3–1.8). One-year survival was 65% and 70%, respectively, corresponding to a 3- to <12-month hazard ratio of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1–1.5).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Pericarditis may be a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong> of occult cancer and augurs increased mortality after a cancer diagnosis.</p></sec>

Functional Definition of Progenitors Versus Mature Endothelial Cells Reveals Key SoxF-Dependent Differentiation Process
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>During adult life, blood vessel formation is thought to occur via angiogenic processes involving branching from existing vessels. An alternate proposal suggests that neovessels form from endothelial progenitors able to assemble the intimal layers. We here aimed to define vessel-resident endothelial progenitors in vivo in a variety of tissues in physiological and pathological situations such as normal aorta, lungs, and wound healing, tumors, and placenta, as well.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Based on protein expression levels of common endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>s using flow cytometry, 3 subpopulations of endothelial cells could be identified among VE-Cadherin+ and CD45– cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Lineage tracing by using <i>Cdh5cre</i> <sup><i>ERt2</i></sup><i>/Rosa-YFP</i> reporter strategy demonstrated that the CD31–/loVEGFR2lo/intracellular endothelial population was indeed an endovascular progenitor (EVP) of an intermediate CD31intVEGFR2lo/intracellular transit amplifying (TA) and a definitive differentiated (D) CD31hiVEGFR2hi/extracellular population. EVP cells arose from vascular-resident beds that could not be transferred by bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, EVP displayed progenitor-like status with a high proportion of cells in a quiescent cell cycle phase as assessed in wounds, tumors, and aorta. Only EVP cells and not TA and D cells had self-renewal capacity as demonstrated by colony-forming capacity in limiting dilution and by transplantation in Matrigel plugs in recipient mice. RNA sequencing revealed prominent gene expression differences between EVP and D cells. In particular, EVP cells highly expressed genes related to progenitor function including <i>Sox9</i>, <i>Il33</i>, <i>Egfr</i>, and <i>Pdfgrα.</i> Conversely, D cells highly expressed genes related to differentiated endothelium including <i>Ets1&2</i>, <i>Gata2</i>, <i>Cd31</i>, <i>Vwf</i>, and <i>Notch</i>. The RNA sequencing also pointed to an essential role of the <i>Sox18</i> transcription factor. The role of SOX18 in the differentiation process was validated by using lineage-tracing experiments based on S<i>ox18Cre</i><sup><i>ERt2</i></sup><i>/Rosa-YFP</i> mice. Besides, in the absence of functional SOX18/SOXF, EVP progenitors were still present, but TA and D populations were significantly reduced.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings support an entirely novel endothelial hierarchy, from EVP to TA to D, as defined by self-renewal, differentiation, and molecular profiling of an endothelial progenitor. This paradigm shift in our understanding of vascular-resident endothelial progenitors in tissue regeneration opens new avenues for better understanding of cardiovascular biology.</p></sec>

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">marker</span></strong>, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart disease, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart disease (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

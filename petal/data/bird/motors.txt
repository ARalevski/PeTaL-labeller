Stress conditioning also increased SERCA2 (Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase 2) expression, which correlated with a less negative force-frequency relationship. When electric pacing was combined with static stress conditioning, the tissues showed an additional increase in force production (1.34±0.19 mN/mm<sup>2</sup>), with no change in construct alignment or cell size, suggesting maturation of excitation-contraction coupling.

Profiling the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force in B cell activation
<p>B lymphocytes use B cell receptors (BCRs) to recognize membrane-bound antigens to further initiate cell spreading and contraction responses during B cell activation. We combined traction force microscopy and live-cell imaging to profile the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion in these responses. We showed that B cell activation required the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of 10 to 20 nN of traction force when encountering antigens presented by substrates with stiffness values from 0.5 to 1 kPa, which mimic the rigidity of antigen-presenting cells in vivo. Perturbation experiments revealed that F-actin remodeling and myosin- and dynein-mediated contractility contributed to traction force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion and B cell activation. Moreover, membrane-proximal BCR signaling molecules (including Lyn, Syk, Btk, PLC-γ2, BLNK, and Vav3) and adaptor molecules (Grb2, Cbl, and Dok-3) linking BCR microclusters and motor proteins were also required for the sustained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of these traction forces. We found a positive correlation between the strength of the traction force and the mean fluorescence intensity of the BCR microclusters. Furthermore, we demonstrated that isotype-switched memory B cells expressing immunoglobulin G (IgG)–BCRs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed greater traction forces than did mature naive B cells expressing IgM-BCRs during B cell activation. Last, we observed that primary B cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed greater traction forces than did B cells from healthy donors in response to antigen stimulation. Together, these data delineate the origin, dynamics, and function of traction force during B cell activation.</p>

SOX17 Regulates Conversion of Human Fibroblasts Into Endothelial Cells and Erythroblasts by Dedifferentiation Into CD34<sup>+</sup> Progenitor Cells
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms underlying the dedifferentiation and lineage conversion of adult human fibroblasts into functional endothelial cells have not yet been fully defined. Furthermore, it is not known whether fibroblast dedifferentiation recapitulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of multipotent progenitors during embryonic development, which give rise to endothelial and hematopoietic cell lineages.

Tailored semiconductors for high-harmonic optoelectronics
<p>The advent of high-harmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion in gases 30 years ago set the foundation for attosecond science and facilitated ultrafast spectroscopy in atoms, molecules, and solids. We explore high-harmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion in the solid state by means of nanostructured and ion-implanted semiconductors. We use wavelength-selective microscopic imaging to map enhanced harmonic emission and show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion medium and the driving field can be locally tailored in solids by modifying the chemical composition and morphology. This enables the control of high-harmonic technology within precisely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered solid targets. We demonstrate customized high-harmonic wave fields with wavelengths down to 225 nanometers (ninth-harmonic order of 2-micrometer laser pulses) and present an integrated Fresnel zone plate target in silicon, which leads to diffraction-limited self-focusing of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed harmonics down to 1-micrometer spot sizes.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering.</p>

Design and evaluation of engineered protein biosensors for live-cell imaging of EGFR phosphorylation
<p>Live-cell fluorescence microscopy is broadly applied to study the dynamics of receptor-mediated cell signaling, but the availability of intracellular biosensors is limited. A biosensor based on the tandem SH2 domains from phospholipase C–γ1 (PLCγ1), tSH2-WT, has been used to measure phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, we found that tSH2-WT lacked specificity for phosphorylated EGFR, consistent with the known promiscuity of SH2 domains. Further, EGF-stimulated membrane recruitment of tSH2-WT differed qualitatively from the expected kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation. Analysis of a mathematical model suggested, and experiments confirmed, that the high avidity of tSH2-WT resulted in saturation of its target and interference with EGFR endocytosis. To overcome the apparent target specificity and saturation issues, we implemented two protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering strategies. In the first approach, we screened a combinatorial library <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by random mutagenesis of the C-terminal SH2 domain (cSH2) of PLCγ1 and isolated a mutant form (mSH2) with enhanced specificity for phosphorylated Tyr<sup>992</sup> (pTyr<sup>992</sup>) of EGFR. A biosensor based on mSH2 closely reported the kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation but retained cross-reactivity similar to tSH2-WT. In the second approach, we isolated a pTyr<sup>992</sup>-binding protein (SPY992) from a combinatorial library <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by mutagenesis of the Sso7d protein scaffold. Compared to tSH2-WT and mSH2, SPY992 exhibited superior performance as a specific, moderate-affinity biosensor. We extended this approach to isolate a biosensor for EGFR pTyr<sup>1148</sup> (SPY1148). This approach of integrating theoretical considerations with protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering strategies can be generalized to design and evaluate suitable biosensors for various phospho-specific targets.</p>

A coupled-clock system drives the automaticity of human sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells
<p>The spontaneous rhythmic action potentials <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker in the heart, dictate the regular and optimal cardiac contractions that pump blood around the body. Although the heart rate of humans is substantially slower than that of smaller experimental animals, current perspectives on the biophysical mechanisms underlying the automaticity of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells (SANCs) have been gleaned largely from studies of animal hearts. Using human SANCs, we demonstrated that spontaneous rhythmic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> clock were coupled to electrogenic surface membrane molecules (the M clock) to trigger rhythmic action potentials, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup>–cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling regulated clock coupling. When these clocks became uncoupled, SANCs failed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e spontaneous action potentials, showing a depolarized membrane potential and disorganized local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases that failed to activate the M clock. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation, which increases cAMP concentrations and clock coupling in other species, restored spontaneous, rhythmic action potentials in some nonbeating “arrested” human SANCs by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and synchronizing diastolic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases. When β-AR stimulation was withdrawn, the clocks again became uncoupled, and SANCs reverted to a nonbeating arrested state. Thus, automaticity of human pacemaker cells is driven by a coupled-clock system driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling. Extreme clock uncoupling led to failure of spontaneous action potential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion, which was restored by recoupling of the clocks. Clock coupling and action potential firing in some of these arrested cells can be restored by β-AR stimulation–induced augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling.</p>

Splenic leukocytes define the resolution of inflammation in heart failure
<p>Inflammation promotes healing in myocardial infarction but, if unresolved, leads to heart failure. To define the inflammatory and resolving responses, we quantified leukocyte trafficking and specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) in the infarcted left ventricle and spleen after myocardial infarction, with the goal of distinguishing inflammation from its resolution. Our data suggest that the spleen not only served as a leukocyte reservoir but also was the site where SPMs were actively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed after coronary ligation in mice. Before myocardial infarction, SPMs were more abundant in the spleen than in the left ventricle. At day 1 after coronary ligation, the spleen was depleted of leukocytes, a phenomenon that was associated with greater numbers of leukocytes in the infarcted left ventricle and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of SPMs at the same site, particularly resolvins, maresin, lipoxins, and protectin. In addition, the infarcted left ventricle showed increased expression of genes encoding lipoxygenases and enhanced production of SPMs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by these enzymes. We found that macrophages were necessary for SPM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. The abundance of SPMs in the spleen before myocardial infarction and increased SPM concentrations in the infarcted left ventricle within 24 hours after myocardial infarction were temporally correlated with the resolution of inflammation. Thus, the acute inflammatory response coincided with the active resolving phase in post–myocardial infarction and suggests that further investigation into macrophage-derived SPMs in heart failure is warranted.</p>

Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level circuits could enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering of powerful new cellular behaviors. Rational protein circuit design would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different circuit architectures. In this study, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of circuit-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (circuits of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e regulatory cascades, binary logic gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally designed a circuit that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene.

Visualizing Embolism Propagation in Gas-Injected Leaves
<p>Because the xylem in leaves is thought to be at the greatest risk of cavitation, reliable and efficient methods to characterize leaf xylem vulnerability are of interest. We report a method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e leaf xylem vulnerability curves (VCs) by gas injection. Using optical light transmission, we visualized embolism propagation in grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) and red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves injected with positive gas pressure. This resulted in a rapid, stepwise reduction of transmitted light, identical to that observed during leaf dehydration, confirming that the optical method detects gas bubbles and provides insights into the air-seeding hypothesis. In red oak, xylem VCs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed using gas injection were similar to those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed using bench dehydration, but indicated 50% loss of conductivity at lower tension (∼0.4 MPa) in grapevine. In determining VC, this method eliminates the need to ascertain xylem tension, thus avoiding potential errors in water potential estimations. It is also much faster (1 h per VC). However, severing the petiole and applying high-pressure gas could affect air-seeding and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed VC. We discuss potential artifacts arising from gas injection and recommend comparison of this method with a more standard procedure before it is assumed to be suitable for a given species.</p>

Consensus Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Key Regulators of Flower and Fruit Development in Wild Strawberry
<p>The diploid strawberry, <i>Fragaria vesca</i>, is a developing model system for the economically important Rosaceae family. Strawberry fleshy fruit develops from the floral receptacle and its ripening is nonclimacteric. The external seed configuration of strawberry fruit facilitates the study of seed-to-fruit cross tissue communication, particularly phytohormone biosynthesis and transport. To investigate strawberry fruit development, we previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed spatial and temporal transcriptome data profiling <i>F. vesca</i> flower and fruit development pre- and postfertilization. In this study, we combined 46 of our existing RNA-seq libraries to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e coexpression networks using the Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis package in R. We then applied a post-hoc consensus clustering approach and used bootstrapping to demonstrate consensus clustering’s ability to produce robust and reproducible clusters. Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the networks, including increased iron transport from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene.

The Arabidopsis DNA Methylome Is Stable under Transgenerational Drought Stress
<p>Improving the responsiveness, acclimation, and memory of plants to abiotic stress holds substantive potential for improving agriculture. An unresolved question is the involvement of chromatin marks in the memory of agriculturally relevant stresses. Such potential has spurred numerous investigations yielding both promising and conflicting results. Consequently, it remains unclear to what extent robust stress-induced DNA methylation variation can underpin stress memory. Using a slow-onset water deprivation treatment in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), we investigated the malleability of the DNA methylome to drought stress within a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion and under repeated drought stress over five successive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ions. While drought-associated epi-alleles in the methylome were detected within a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion, they did not correlate with drought-responsive gene expression. Six traits were analyzed for trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ional stress memory, and the descendants of drought-stressed lineages showed one case of memory in the form of increased seed dormancy, and that persisted one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion removed from stress. With respect to trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ional drought stress, there were negligible conserved differentially methylated regions in drought-exposed lineages compared with unstressed lineages. Instead, the majority of observed variation was tied to stochastic or preexisting differences in the epigenome occurring at repetitive regions of the Arabidopsis genome. Furthermore, the experience of repeated drought stress was not observed to influence trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ional epi-allele accumulation. Our findings demonstrate that, while trans<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ional memory is observed in one of six traits examined, they are not associated with causative changes in the DNA methylome, which appears relatively impervious to drought stress.</p>

Developmental Defects Mediated by the P1/HC-Pro Potyviral Silencing Suppressor Are Not Due to Misregulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i>
<p>Plant viral suppressors of RNA silencing induce developmental defects similar to those caused by mutations in genes involved in the microRNA pathway. A recent report has attributed viral suppressor-mediated developmental defects to up-regulation of <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 8</i> (<i>ARF8</i>), a target of miR167. The key piece of evidence was that the developmental defects in transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) expressing viral suppressors were greatly alleviated in the F1 progeny of a cross with plants carrying the <i>arf8-6</i> mutation. <i>Arf8-6</i> is a SALK line T-DNA insertion mutant, a class of mutations prone to inducing transcriptional silencing of transgenes expressed from the 35S promoter. We have reinvestigated the role of <i>ARF8</i> in viral suppressor-mediated developmental defects, using two independent <i>arf8</i> mutations and the P1/HC-Pro potyviral suppressor of silencing. Progeny of a cross between <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgenic Arabidopsis and the <i>arf8-6</i> T-DNA insertion mutant showed little effect on the P1/HC-Pro phenotype in the F1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion, but almost all <i>arf8-6</i>/<i>P1/HC-Pro</i> progeny had lost the phenotype in the F2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. However, the loss of phenotype in the F2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion was not correlated with the number of functional copies of the <i>ARF8</i> gene. Instead, it reflected transcriptional silencing of the <i>P1/HC-Pro</i> transgene, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in P1/HC-Pro mRNA and the appearance of 35S promoter small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, an independent loss-of-function point mutation, <i>Arf8-8</i>, had no detectable effects on P1/HC-Pro phenotype in either the F1 or F2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ions. Together, these data argue against the previously reported role of increased <i>ARF8</i> expression in developmental defects caused by <i>P1/HC-Pro</i>.</p>

Cross-generation plasticity in cold hardiness is associated with diapause, but not the non-diapause developmental pathway, in the blow fly <i>Calliphora vicina</i>
<p>Predicting insect responses to global climate change involves understanding cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion effects of temperature. The majority of temperate insects overwinter in a state of diapause, a pre-emptive response to winter conditions associated with increased cold hardiness. Diapause is often induced following maternal adult detection of an environmental cue signifying the onset of winter, whilst diapause is initiated in a subsequent life stage and/or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. Continued global warming will expose adults to higher late-autumn temperatures, whilst diapause life stages will still experience prolonged winter cold. The cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion effect of temperature was investigated by acclimating adult <i>Calliphora vicina</i> to present-day (15°C) and future (20°C) late-autumn conditions and assessing cold-hardiness in diapause (D15 and D20) and non-diapause (ND15 and ND20) progeny. A cross-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion plasticity in cold hardiness was associated with D but not ND larvae. D15 larvae exhibited an enhanced ability to suppress internal freezing (supercooling point=−18.9±0.9°C) compared with D20 (−15.3±0.8°C), and displayed a greater tolerance of prolonged exposure to −4°C (LT<sub>50</sub>=26.0±1.0 and 11.4±1.1 days, respectively) and −8°C (5.1±1.1 and 3.0±1.1 days, respectively). These changes were associated with a reduced glucose content in D15 (2.4±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) compared with D20 (3.0±0.3 g mg<sup>−1</sup>) larvae. In conclusion, <i>C. vicina</i> adults exposed to warmer autumn conditions during diapause induction will produce larvae with a reduced cold hardiness capacity, which could negatively impact winter survival. Given that maternal regulation of diapause is common among temperate insects, this could be a widespread phenomenon.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>es fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>es a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the mechanism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ing water motion by mouth suction.</p>

Diacylglycerol kinase ζ limits the polarized recruitment of diacylglycerol-enriched organelles to the immune synapse in T cells
<p>The antigen-induced formation of an immune synapse (IS) between T cells and antigen-presenting cells results in the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) in T cells. Diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ) converts DAG into phosphatidic acid (PA). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from mice deficient in DGKζ have enhanced antiviral and antitumor activities, indicating that the amount of DAG controls the effectiveness of the T cell response. We characterized the second C1 domain of protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ), a DAG-binding protein that is specifically recruited to the IS, as a biological sensor to observe the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of a DAG gradient during IS formation. In experiments with transgenic mouse CTLs expressing the OT-I T cell receptor (TCR), we showed that both strong and weak interactions between antigen and the TCR led to the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of DAG, whereas only strong interactions induced the movement of DAG-enriched organelles toward the IS. In DGKζ-deficient CTLs, antigen stimulation led to the enhanced accumulation of DAG-containing organelles at the IS; however, impaired activation of the PA effector PKCζ resulted in lack of reorientation of the microtubule-organizing center toward the IS, a process needed for effective T cell activation. Together, these data suggest that the activation of DGKζ downstream of antigen recognition provides a mechanism that ensures the activation of PA-dependent signaling as a direct result of the strength of TCR-dependent DAG mobilization.</p>

Networks of enzymatically oxidized membrane lipids support calcium-dependent coagulation factor binding to maintain hemostasis
<p>Blood coagulation functions as part of the innate immune system by preventing bacterial invasion, and it is critical to stopping blood loss (hemostasis). Coagulation involves the external membrane surface of activated platelets and leukocytes. Using lipidomic, genetic, biochemical, and mathematical modeling approaches, we found that enzymatically oxidized phospholipids (eoxPLs) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed by the activity of leukocyte or platelet lipoxygenases (LOXs) were required for normal hemostasis and promoted coagulation factor activities in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and phosphatidylserine (PS)–dependent manner. In wild-type mice, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid–phospholipids (HETE-PLs) enhanced coagulation and restored normal hemostasis in clotting-deficient animals genetically lacking p12-LOX or 12/15-LOX activity. Murine platelets <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed 22 eoxPL species, all of which were missing in the absence of p12-LOX. Humans with the thrombotic disorder antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) had statistically significantly increased HETE-PLs in platelets and leukocytes, as well as greater HETE-PL immunoreactivity, than healthy controls. HETE-PLs enhanced membrane binding of the serum protein β2GP1 (β2-glycoprotein 1), an event considered central to the autoimmune reactivity responsible for APS symptoms. Correlation network analysis of 47 platelet eoxPL species in platelets from APS and control subjects identified their enzymatic origin and revealed a complex network of regulation, with the abundance of 31 p12-LOX–derived eoxPL molecules substantially increased in APS. In summary, circulating blood cells <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e networks of eoxPL molecules, including HETE-PLs, which change membrane properties to enhance blood coagulation and contribute to the excessive clotting and immunoreactivity of patients with APS.</p>

Quantum entanglement of the spin and orbital angular momentum of photons using metamaterials

Imaging of pure spin-valley diffusion current in WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures

Hypothalamic regulation of regionally distinct adult neural stem cells and neurogenesis

Here, we show that the hypothalamus, a brain area regulating physiological states, provides long-range regionalized input to the V-SVZ niche and can regulate specific NSC subpopulations.

Transgenerational transmission of environmental information in <i>C. elegans</i>

Inheritance is primarily in cis with the locus, occurs through both oocytes and sperm, and is associated with altered trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) before the onset of zygotic transcription.

Metabolome Analysis of Multi-Connected Biparental Chromosome Segment Substitution Line Populations
<p>Metabolomic analysis coupled with advanced genetic populations represents a powerful tool with which to investigate the plant metabolome. However, genetic analyses of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) metabolome have been conducted mainly using natural accessions or a single biparental population. Here, the flag leaves from three interconnected chromosome segment substitution line populations with a common recurrent genetic background were used to dissect rice metabolic diversity. We effectively used multiple interconnected biparental populations, constructed by introducing genomic segments into Zhenshan 97 from ACC10 (A/Z), Minghui 63 (M/Z), and Nipponbare (N/Z), to map metabolic quantitative trait loci (mQTL). A total of 1,587 mQTL were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed, of which 684, 479, and 722 were obtained from the A/Z, M/Z, and N/Z chromosome segment substitution line populations, respectively, and we designated 99 candidate genes for 367 mQTL. In addition, 1,001 mQTL were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed specifically from joint linkage analysis with 25 candidate genes assigned. Several of these candidates were validated, such as <i>LOC_Os07g01020</i> for the in vivo content of pyridoxine and its derivative and <i>LOC_Os04g25980</i> for cis-zeatin glucosyltransferase activity. We propose a novel biosynthetic pathway for <i>O</i>-methylapigenin <i>C</i>-pentoside and demonstrated that <i>LOC_Os04g11970</i> encodes a component of this pathway through fine-mapping. We postulate that the methylated apigenin may confer plant disease resistance. This study demonstrates the power of using multiple interconnected populations to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e a large number of veritable mQTL. The combined results are discussed in the context of functional metabolomics and the possible features of assigned candidates underlying respective metabolites.</p>

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of metabolites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced accumulation of Lys has been achieved via metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering in cereals, but the potential connection between metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key metabolites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely linked with dark-brown endosperm color in HFL rice. A functional connection between serotonin and endosperm color was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with serotonin accumulation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the metabolic connection between Lys and serotonin metabolism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin accumulation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid metabolism in rice. In addition, the finding that both Lys and serotonin accumulate in HFL rice grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable crop.</p>

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1

Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thioacidolysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 coupling of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde coupling products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is converted into ferulic acid and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively coupled into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or converted to sinapic acid and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar platform industry.</p>

Catastrophic Unbalanced Genome Rearrangements Cause Somatic Loss of Berry Color in Grapevine

To understand the mutational mechanisms <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ing somatic structural variation in grapevine, we compared the Tempranillo Blanco (TB) white berry somatic variant with its black berry ancestor, Tempranillo Tinto. Whole-genome sequencing uncovered a catastrophic genome rearrangement in TB that caused the hemizygous deletion of 313 genes, including the loss of the functional copy for the <i>MYB</i> transcription factors required for anthocyanin pigmentation in the berry skin. Loss of heterozygosity and decreased copy number delimited interspersed monosomic and disomic regions in the right arm of linkage groups 2 and 5. At least 11 validated clustered breakpoints involving intrachromosomal and interchromosomal translocations between three linkage groups flanked the deleted fragments, which, according to segregation analyses, are phased in a single copy of each of the affected chromosomes. These hallmarks, along with the lack of homology between breakpoint joins and the randomness of the order and orientation of the rearranged fragments, are all consistent with a chromothripsis-like pattern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed after chromosome breakage and illegitimate rejoining. This unbalanced genome reshuffling has additional consequences in reproductive development.

Plant Glandular Trichomes: Natural Cell Factories of High Biotechnological Interest
<p>Multicellular glandular trichomes are epidermal outgrowths characterized by the presence of a head made of cells that have the ability to secrete or store large quantities of specialized metabolites. Our understanding of the transcriptional control of glandular trichome initiation and development is still in its infancy. This review points to some central questions that need to be addressed to better understand how such specialized cell structures arise from the plant protodermis. A key and unique feature of glandular trichomes is their ability to synthesize and secrete large amounts, relative to their size, of a limited number of metabolites. As such, they qualify as true cell factories, making them interesting targets for metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering. In this review, recent advances regarding terpene metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering are highlighted, with a special focus on tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). In particular, the choice of transcriptional promoters to drive transgene expression and the best ways to sink existing pools of terpene precursors are discussed. The bioavailability of existing pools of natural precursor molecules is a key parameter and is controlled by so-called cross talk between different biosynthetic pathways. As highlighted in this review, the exact nature and extent of such cross talk are only partially understood at present.

CRISPR-Cas9 Targeted Mutagenesis Leads to Simultaneous Modification of Different Homoeologous Gene Copies in Polyploid Oilseed Rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>)

We have stably transformed tetraploid oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) with a CRISPR-Cas9 construct targeting two <i>ALCATRAZ</i> (<i>ALC</i>) homoeologs. <i>ALC</i> is involved in valve margin development and, thus, contributes to seed shattering from mature fruits. Knocking out <i>ALC</i> would increase shatter resistance to avoid seed loss during mechanical harvest. We obtained a transgenic T1 plant with four <i>alc</i> mutant alleles by the use of a single target sequence. All mutations were stably inherited to the T2 progeny. The T2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion was devoid of any wild-type alleles, proving that the underlying T1 was a nonchimeric double heterozygote.

Hence, we could select double mutants lacking the T-DNA already in the first offspring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. However, whole-genome sequencing data revealed at least five independent insertions of vector backbone sequences.

A Specialized Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase Contributes to the Extreme Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Content of <i>Cuphea</i> Seed Oil
<p>Seed oils of many <i>Cuphea</i> sp. contain >90% of medium-chain fatty acids, such as decanoic acid (10:0). These seed oils, which are among the most compositionally variant in the plant kingdom, arise from specialized fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes and specialized acyltransferases. These include lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (LPAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) that are required for successive acylation of medium-chain fatty acids in the <i>sn</i>-2 and <i>sn</i>-3 positions of seed triacylglycerols (TAGs). Here we report the identification of a cDNA for a DGAT1-type enzyme, designated CpuDGAT1, from the transcriptome of <i>C. avigera</i> var <i>pulcherrima</i> developing seeds. Microsomes of camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>) seeds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered for CpuDGAT1 expression displayed DGAT activity with 10:0-CoA and the diacylglycerol didecanoyl, that was approximately 4-fold higher than that in camelina seed microsomes lacking CpuDGAT1. In addition, coexpression in camelina seeds of CpuDGAT1 with a <i>C. viscosissima</i> FatB thioesterase (CvFatB1) that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>es 10:0 resulted in TAGs with nearly 15 mol % of 10:0. More strikingly, expression of CpuDGAT1 and CvFatB1 with the previously described CvLPAT2, a 10:0-CoA-specific <i>Cuphea</i> LPAT, increased 10:0 amounts to 25 mol % in camelina seed TAG. These TAGs contained up to 40 mol % 10:0 in the <i>sn</i>-2 position, nearly double the amounts obtained from coexpression of CvFatB1 and CvLPAT2 alone. Although enriched in diacylglycerol, 10:0 was not detected in phosphatidylcholine in these seeds. These findings are consistent with channeling of 10:0 into TAG through the combined activities of specialized LPAT and DGAT activities and demonstrate the biotechnological use of these enzymes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e 10:0-rich seed oils.</p>

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants

To <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic enzymes, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and identified metabolic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we identified 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we identified patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic gene clusters.</p>

To estimate mutation rates and evaluate the effect of selection on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ions and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion was due to a large ameiotic recombination event spanning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events spanning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Direct Determination of the Mutation Rate in the Bumblebee Reveals Evidence for Weak Recombination-Associated Mutation and an Approximate Rate Constancy in Insects
<p>Accurate knowledge of the mutation rate provides a base line for inferring expected rates of evolution, for testing evolutionary hypotheses and for estimation of key parameters. Advances in sequencing technology now permit direct estimates of the mutation rate from sequencing of close relatives. Within insects there have been three prior such estimates, two in nonsocial insects (<i>Drosophila</i>: 2.8 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per bp per haploid genome per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion; <i>Heliconius</i>: 2.9 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) and one in a social species, the honeybee (3.4 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>). Might the honeybee’s rate be ∼20% higher because it has an exceptionally high recombination rate and recombination may be directly or indirectly mutagenic? To address this possibility, we provide a direct estimate of the mutation rate in the bumblebee (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>), this being a close relative of the honeybee but with a much lower recombination rate. We confirm that the crossover rate of the bumblebee is indeed much lower than honeybees (8.7 cM/Mb vs. 37 cM/Mb). Importantly, we find no significant difference in the mutation rates: we estimate for bumblebees a rate of 3.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> per haploid genome per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion (95% confidence intervals 2.38 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup> and 5.37 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>9</sup>) which is just 5% higher than the estimate that of honeybees. Both genomes have approximately one new mutation per haploid genome per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion. While we find evidence for a direct coupling between recombination and mutation (also seen in honeybees), the effect is so weak as to leave almost no footprint on any between-species differences. The similarity in mutation rates suggests an approximate constancy of the mutation rate in insects.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Cross-species analysis of genetically engineered mouse models of MAPK-driven colorectal cancer identifies hallmarks of the human disease
<p>Effective treatment options for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) are limited, survival rates are poor and this disease continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite being a highly heterogeneous disease, a large subset of individuals with sporadic CRC typically harbor relatively few established ‘driver’ lesions. Here, we describe a collection of genetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered mouse models (GEMMs) of sporadic CRC that combine lesions frequently altered in human patients, including well-characterized tumor suppressors and activators of MAPK signaling. Primary tumors from these models were profiled, and individual GEMM tumors segregated into groups based on their genotypes. Unique allelic and genotypic expression signatures were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed from these GEMMs and applied to clinically annotated human CRC patient samples. We provide evidence that a <i>Kras</i> signature derived from these GEMMs is capable of distinguishing human tumors harboring <i>KRAS</i> mutation, and tracks with poor prognosis in two independent human patient cohorts. Furthermore, the analysis of a panel of human CRC cell lines suggests that high expression of the GEMM <i>Kras</i> signature correlates with sensitivity to targeted pathway inhibitors. Together, these findings implicate GEMMs as powerful preclinical tools with the capacity to recapitulate relevant human disease biology, and support the use of genetic signatures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed in these models to facilitate future drug discovery and validation efforts.</p>

Development
The phosphorylation status of Ascl1 is a key determinant of neuronal differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of neurons from patient fibroblasts using a combination of developmentally defined transcription factors has great potential in disease modelling, as well as ultimately for use in re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion and repair. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of physiologically mature neurons <i>in vitro</i> remains problematic. Here we demonstrate the cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of a key reprogramming transcription factor, Ascl1, on multiple serine-proline sites. This multisite phosphorylation is a crucial regulator of the ability of Ascl1 to drive neuronal differentiation and maturation <i>in vivo</i> in the developing embryo; a phosphomutant form of Ascl1 shows substantially enhanced neuronal induction activity in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos. Mechanistically, we see that this un(der)phosphorylated Ascl1 is resistant to inhibition by both cyclin-dependent kinase activity and Notch signalling, both of which normally limit its neurogenic potential. Ascl1 is a central component of reprogramming transcription factor cocktails to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e neurons from human fibroblasts; the use of phosphomutant Ascl1 in place of the wild-type protein significantly promotes neuronal maturity after human fibroblast reprogramming <i>in vitro</i>. These results demonstrate that cell-cycle-dependent post-translational modification of proneural proteins directly regulates neuronal differentiation <i>in vivo</i> during development, and that this regulatory mechanism can be harnessed to promote maturation of neurons obtained by transdifferentiation of human cells <i>in vitro</i>.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in plants could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most plants, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) plants overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects plant N use efficiency. The modified plants were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eered plants allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type plants. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing plants displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control plants. Together, these data support that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop plants with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

Autophagy Deficiency Compromises Alternative Pathways of Respiration following Energy Deprivation in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Under heterotrophic conditions, carbohydrate oxidation inside the mitochondrion is the primary energy source for cellular metabolism. However, during energy-limited conditions, alternative substrates are required to support respiration. Amino acid oxidation in plant cells plays a key role in this by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ing electrons that can be transferred to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via the electron transfer flavoprotein/ubiquinone oxidoreductase system. Autophagy, a catabolic mechanism for macromolecule and protein recycling, allows the maintenance of amino acid pools and nutrient remobilization. Although the association between autophagy and alternative respiratory substrates has been suggested, the extent to which autophagy and primary metabolism interact to support plant respiration remains unclear. To investigate the metabolic importance of autophagy during development and under extended darkness, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with disruption of autophagy (<i>atg</i> mutants) were used. Under normal growth conditions, <i>atg</i> mutants showed lower growth and seed production with no impact on photosynthesis. Following extended darkness, <i>atg</i> mutants were characterized by signatures of early senescence, including decreased chlorophyll content and maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II coupled with increases in dark respiration. Transcript levels of genes involved in alternative pathways of respiration and amino acid catabolism were up-regulated in <i>atg</i> mutants. The metabolite profiles of dark-treated leaves revealed an extensive metabolic reprogramming in which increases in amino acid levels were partially compromised in <i>atg</i> mutants. Although an enhanced respiration in <i>atg</i> mutants was observed during extended darkness, autophagy deficiency compromises protein degradation and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of amino acids used as alternative substrates to the respiration.</p>

Generation of a Collection of Mutant Tomato Lines Using Pooled CRISPR Libraries
<p>The high efficiency of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated mutagenesis in plants enables the development of high-throughput mutagenesis strategies. By transforming pooled CRISPR libraries into tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), collections of mutant lines were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed with minimal transformation attempts and in a relatively short period of time. Identification of the targeted gene(s) was easily determined by sequencing the incorporated guide RNA(s) in the primary transgenic events. From a single transformation with a CRISPR library targeting the immunity-associated leucine-rich repeat subfamily XII genes, heritable mutations were recovered in 15 of the 54 genes targeted. To increase throughput, a second CRISPR library was made containing three guide RNAs per construct to target 18 putative transporter genes. This resulted in stable mutations in 15 of the 18 targeted genes, with some primary transgenic plants having as many as five mutated genes. Furthermore, the redundancy in this collection of plants allowed for the association of aberrant T0 phenotypes with the underlying targeted genes. Plants with mutations in a homolog of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) boron efflux transporter displayed boron deficiency phenotypes. The strategy described here provides a technically simple yet high-throughput approach for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ing a collection of lines with targeted mutations and should be applicable to any plant transformation system.</p>

The Auxin Biosynthetic <i>TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE RELATED TaTAR2.1-3A</i> Increases Grain Yield of Wheat
<p>Controlling the major auxin biosynthetic pathway to manipulate auxin content could be a target for genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering of crops with desired traits, but little progress had been made because low or high auxin contents often cause developmental inhibition. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) to identify the Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1/Tryptophan Aminotransferase-Related (TAA1/TAR) genes that function in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of auxin biosynthesis. Sequence mining together with gene cloning identified 15 <i>TaTAR</i> genes, among which 12 and three genes were phylogenetically close to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtTAR2 and AtTAR3, respectively. <i>TaTAR2.1</i> had the most abundant transcripts in the <i>TaTAR2</i> genes and was expressed mainly in roots and up-regulated by low nitrogen (N) availability. Knockdown of <i>TaTAR2.1</i> caused vegetative and reproductive deficiencies and impaired lateral root (LR) growth under both high- and low-N conditions. Overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in wheat enhanced LR branching, plant height, spike number, grain yield, and aerial N accumulation under different N supply levels. In addition, overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in Arabidopsis elevated auxin accumulation in the primary root tip, LR tip, LR primordia, and cotyledon and hypocotyl and increased primary root length, visible LR number, and shoot fresh weight under high- and low-N conditions. Our results indicate that <i>TaTAR2.1</i> is critical for wheat growth and also shows potential for genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">engin</span></strong>eering to reach the aim of improving the grain yield of wheat.</p>

A SIMPLE Pipeline for Mapping Point Mutations
<p>A forward genetic screen is one of the best methods for revealing the function of genes.

Modeling of Dolichol Mass Spectra Isotopic Envelopes as a Tool to Monitor Isoprenoid Biosynthesis
<p>The cooperation of the mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways, operating in parallel in plants to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e isoprenoid precursors, has been studied extensively. Elucidation of the isoprenoid metabolic pathways is indispensable for the rational design of plant and microbial systems for the production of industrially valuable terpenoids. Here, we describe a new method, based on numerical modeling of mass spectra of metabolically labeled dolichols (Dols), designed to quantitatively follow the cooperation of MVA and MEP reprogrammed upon osmotic stress (sorbitol treatment) in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The contribution of the MEP pathway increased significantly (reaching 100%) exclusively for the dominating Dols, while for long-chain Dols, the relative input of the MEP and MVA pathways remained unchanged, suggesting divergent sites of synthesis for dominating and long-chain Dols. The analysis of numerically modeled Dol mass spectra is a novel method to follow modulation of the concomitant activity of isoprenoid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ing pathways in plant cells; additionally, it suggests an exchange of isoprenoid intermediates between plastids and peroxisomes.</p>

Biochemical Principles and Functional Aspects of Pipecolic Acid Biosynthesis in Plant Immunity
<p>The nonprotein amino acid pipecolic acid (Pip) regulates plant systemic acquired resistance and basal immunity to bacterial pathogen infection. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the lysine (Lys) aminotransferase AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1 (ALD1) mediates the pathogen-induced accumulation of Pip in inoculated and distal leaf tissue. Here, we show that ALD1 transfers the α-amino group of <sc>l</sc>-Lys to acceptor oxoacids. Combined mass spectrometric and infrared spectroscopic analyses of in vitro assays and plant extracts indicate that the final product of the ALD1-catalyzed reaction is enaminic 2,3-dehydropipecolic acid (DP), whose formation involves consecutive transamination, cyclization, and isomerization steps. Besides <sc>l</sc>-Lys, recombinant ALD1 transaminates <sc>l</sc>-methionine, <sc>l</sc>-leucine, diaminopimelate, and several other amino acids to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e oxoacids or derived products in vitro. However, detailed in planta analyses suggest that the biosynthesis of 2,3-DP from <sc>l</sc>-Lys is the major in vivo function of ALD1. Since <i>ald1</i> mutant plants are able to convert exogenous 2,3-DP into Pip, their Pip deficiency relies on the inability to form the 2,3-DP intermediate. The Arabidopsis reductase ornithine cyclodeaminase/μ-crystallin, alias SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE-DEFICIENT4 (SARD4), converts ALD1-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed 2,3-DP into Pip in vitro. SARD4 significantly contributes to the production of Pip in pathogen-inoculated leaves but is not the exclusive reducing enzyme involved in Pip biosynthesis. Functional <i>SARD4</i> is required for proper basal immunity to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Although <i>SARD4</i> knockout plants show greatly reduced accumulation of Pip in leaves distal to <i>P. syringae</i> inoculation, they display a considerable systemic acquired resistance response. This suggests a triggering function of locally accumulating Pip for systemic resistance induction.</p>

Starch Synthase 4 and Plastidal Phosphorylase Differentially Affect Starch Granule Number and Morphology
<p>The process of starch granule formation in leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is obscure. Besides STARCH SYNTHASE4 (SS4), the PLASTIDIAL PHOSPHORYLASE (PHS1) also seems to be involved, since <i>dpe2-1/phs1a</i> double mutants lacking both PHS1 and the cytosolic DISPROPORTIONATING ENZYME2 (DPE2) displayed only one starch granule per chloroplast under normal growth conditions. For further studies, a <i>dpe2-1/phs1a/ss4</i> triple mutant and various combinations of double mutants were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed and metabolically analyzed with a focus on starch metabolism. The <i>dpe2-1/phs1a/ss4</i> mutant revealed a massive starch excess phenotype. Furthermore, these plants grown under 12 h of light/12 h of dark harbored a single large and spherical starch granule per plastid. The number of starch granules was constant when the light/dark regime was altered, but this was not observed in the parental lines. With regard to growth, photosynthetic parameters, and metabolic analyses, the triple mutant additionally displayed alterations in comparison with <i>ss4</i> and <i>dpe2-1/phs1a</i>. The results clearly illustrate that PHS1 and SS4 are differently involved in starch granule formation and do not act in series. However, SS4 appears to exert a stronger influence. In connection with the characterized double mutants, we discuss the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of starch granules and the observed formation of spherical starch granules.</p>

Aldehyde Oxidase 4 Plays a Critical Role in Delaying Silique Senescence by Catalyzing Aldehyde Detoxification
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) aldehyde oxidases are a multigene family of four oxidases (AAO1–AAO4) that oxidize a variety of aldehydes, among them abscisic aldehyde, which is oxidized to the phytohormone abscisic acid. Toxic aldehydes are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ed in plants both under normal conditions and in response to stress. The detoxification of such aldehydes by oxidation is attributed to aldehyde dehydrogenases but never to aldehyde oxidases. The feasibility of the detoxification of aldehydes in siliques via oxidation by AAO4 was demonstrated, first, by its ability to efficiently oxidize an array of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, including the reactive carbonyl species (RCS) acrolein, hydroxyl-2-nonenal, and malondialdehyde. Next, exogenous application of several aldehydes to siliques in AAO4 knockout (KO) Arabidopsis plants induced severe tissue damage and enhanced malondialdehyde levels and senescence symptoms, but not in wild-type siliques. Furthermore, abiotic stresses such as dark and ultraviolet C irradiation caused an increase in endogenous RCS and higher expression levels of senescence marker genes, leading to premature senescence of KO siliques, whereas RCS and senescence marker levels in wild-type siliques were hardly affected. Finally, in naturally senesced KO siliques, higher endogenous RCS levels were associated with enhanced senescence molecular markers, chlorophyll degradation, and earlier seed shattering compared with the wild type. The aldehyde-dependent differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide by AAO4 and the induction of AAO4 expression by hydrogen peroxide shown here suggest a self-amplification mechanism for detoxifying additional reactive aldehydes produced during stress. Taken together, our results indicate that AAO4 plays a critical role in delaying senescence in siliques by catalyzing aldehyde detoxification.</p>

Understanding and Manipulating Meiotic Recombination in Plants
<p>Meiosis is a specialized cell division, essential in most reproducing organisms to halve the number of chromosomes, thereby enabling the restoration of ploidy levels during fertilization. A key step of meiosis is homologous recombination, which promotes homologous pairing and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>es crossovers (COs) to connect homologous chromosomes until their separation at anaphase I. These CO sites, seen cytologically as chiasmata, represent a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between two homologous nonsister chromatids. This gene reshuffling during meiosis has a significant influence on evolution and also plays an essential role in plant breeding, because a successful breeding program depends on the ability to bring the desired combinations of alleles on chromosomes. However, the number and distribution of COs during meiosis is highly constrained. There is at least one CO per chromosome pair to ensure accurate segregation of homologs, but in most organisms, the CO number rarely exceeds three regardless of chromosome size. Moreover, their positions are not random on chromosomes but exhibit regional preference. Thus, genes in recombination-poor regions tend to be inherited together, hindering the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion of novel allelic combinations that could be exploited by breeding programs. Recently, much progress has been made in understanding meiotic recombination. In particular, many genes involved in the process in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) have been identified and analyzed. With the coming challenges of food security and climate change, and our enhanced knowledge of how COs are formed, the interest and needs in manipulating CO formation are greater than ever before. In this review, we focus on advances in understanding meiotic recombination and then summarize the attempts to manipulate CO formation. Last, we pay special attention to the meiotic recombination in polyploidy, which is a common genomic feature for many crop plants.</p>

Characterization of Class III Peroxidases from Switchgrass
<p>Class III peroxidases (CIIIPRX) catalyze the oxidation of monolignols, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>e radicals, and ultimately lead to the formation of lignin. In general, CIIIPRX genes encode a large number of isozymes with ranges of in vitro substrate specificities. In order to elucidate the mode of substrate specificity of these enzymes, we characterized one of the CIIIPRXs (PviPRX9) from switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>), a strategic plant for second-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">generat</span></strong>ion biofuels. The crystal structure, kinetic experiments, molecular docking, as well as expression patterns of PviPRX9 across multiple tissues and treatments, along with its levels of coexpression with the majority of genes in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, revealed the function of PviPRX9 in lignification. Significantly, our study suggested that PviPRX9 has the ability to oxidize a broad range of phenylpropanoids with rather similar efficiencies, which reflects its role in the fortification of cell walls during normal growth and root development and in response to insect feeding. Based on the observed interactions of phenylpropanoids in the active site and analysis of kinetics, a catalytic mechanism involving two water molecules and residues histidine-42, arginine-38, and serine-71 was proposed. In addition, proline-138 and gluntamine-140 at the <sup>137</sup>P-X-P-X<sup>140</sup> motif, leucine-66, proline-67, and asparagine-176 may account for the broad substrate specificity of PviPRX9. Taken together, these observations shed new light on the function and catalysis of PviPRX9 and potentially benefit efforts to improve biomass conservation properties in bioenergy and forage crops.</p>

Developmental Programming of Thermonastic Leaf Movement
<p>Plants exhibit diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> behaviors in response to directional and nondirectional environmental signals, termed tropic and nastic movements, respectively. The ways in which plants incorporate directional information into tropic behaviors is well understood, but it is less well understood how nondirectional stimuli, such as ambient temperatures, specify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity of nastic behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that a developmentally programmed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity of auxin flow underlies thermo-induced leaf hyponasty in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In warm environments, PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) stimulates auxin production in the leaf. This results in the accumulation of auxin in leaf petioles, where PIF4 directly activates a gene encoding the PINOID (PID) protein kinase. PID is involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED3 to the outer membranes of petiole cells. Notably, the leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity-determining ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) directs the induction of <i>PID</i> to occur predominantly in the abaxial petiole region. These observations indicate that the integration of PIF4-mediated auxin biosynthesis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> transport, and the AS1-mediated developmental shaping of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin flow, coordinate leaf thermonasty, which facilitates leaf cooling in warm environments. We believe that leaf thermonasty is a suitable model system for studying the developmental programming of environmental adaptation in plants.</p>

Auxin and ROP GTPase Signaling of Polar Nuclear Migration in Root Epidermal Hair Cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear migration is crucial during the development of diverse eukaryotes. In plants, root hair growth requires <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear migration into the outgrowing hair. However, knowledge about the dynamics and the regulatory mechanisms underlying nuclear movements in root epidermal cells remains limited. Here, we show that both auxin and Rho-of-Plant (ROP) signaling modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear position at the inner epidermal plasma membrane domain oriented to the cortical cells during cell elongation as well as subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear movement to the outer domain into the emerging hair bulge in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Auxin signaling via the nuclear AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE ACETIC ACID7 pathway ensures correct nuclear placement toward the inner membrane domain. Moreover, precise inner nuclear placement relies on SPIKE1 Rho-GEF, SUPERCENTIPEDE1 Rho-GDI, and ACTIN7 (ACT7) function and to a lesser extent on VTI11 vacuolar SNARE activity. Strikingly, the directionality and/or velocity of outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear migration into the hair outgrowth along actin strands also are ACT7 dependent, auxin sensitive, and regulated by ROP signaling. Thus, our findings provide a founding framework revealing auxin and ROP signaling of inner <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear position with some contribution by vacuolar morphology and of actin-dependent outer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> nuclear migration in root epidermal hair cells.</p>

A MicroRNA93–Interferon Regulatory Factor-9–Immunoresponsive Gene-1–Itaconic Acid Pathway Modulates M2-Like Macrophage Polarization to Revascularize Ischemic Muscle
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Currently, no therapies exist for treating and improving outcomes in patients with severe peripheral artery disease (PAD). MicroRNA93 (miR93) has been shown to favorably modulate angiogenesis and to reduce tissue loss in genetic PAD models. However, the cell-specific function, downstream mechanisms, or signaling involved in miR93-mediated ischemic muscle neovascularization is not clear. Macrophages were best known to modulate arteriogenic response in PAD, and the extent of arteriogenic response induced by macrophages is dependent on greater M2 to M1 activation/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization state. In the present study, we identified a novel mechanism by which miR93 regulates macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization to promote angiogenesis and arteriogenesis to revascularize ischemic muscle in experimental PAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro (macrophages, endothelial cells, skeletal muscle cells under normal and hypoxia serum starvation conditions) and in vivo experiments in preclinical PAD models (unilateral femoral artery ligation and resection) were conducted to examine the role of miR93-interferon regulatory factor-9–immunoresponsive gene-1 (IRG1)–itaconic acid pathway in macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization, angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In vivo, compared with wild-type controls, miR106b-93-25 cluster–deficient mice (miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup>) showed decreased angiogenesis and arteriogenesis correlating with increased M1-like macrophages after experimental PAD. Intramuscular delivery of miR93 in miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> PAD mice increased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and the extent of perfusion, which correlated with more M2-like macrophages in the proximal and distal hind-limb muscles. In vitro, miR93 promotes and sustains M2-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization even under M1-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>izing conditions (hypoxia serum starvation). Delivery of bone marrow–derived macrophages from miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> to wild-type ischemic muscle decreased angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion, whereas transfer of wild-type macrophages to miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> had the opposite effect. Systematic analysis of top differentially upregulated genes from RNA sequencing between miR106b-93-25<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type ischemic muscle showed that miR93 regulates IRG1 function to modulate itaconic acid production and macrophage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization. The 3′ untranslated region luciferase assays performed to determine whether IRG1 is a direct target of miR93 revealed that IRG1 is not an miR93 target but that interferon regulatory factor-9, which can regulate IRG1 expression, is an miR93 target. In vitro, increased expression of interferon regulatory factor-9 and IRG1 and itaconic acid treatment significantly decreased endothelial angiogenic potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>miR93 inhibits interferon regulatory factor-9 to decrease IRG1–itaconic acid production to induce M2-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization in ischemic muscle to enhance angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and perfusion recovery in experimental PAD.</p></sec>

Polar Localization of the Borate Exporter BOR1 Requires AP2-Dependent Endocytosis
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element in plants but is toxic when it accumulates to high levels. In root cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the borate exporter BOR1 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ly localized in the plasma membrane toward the stele side for directional transport of B. Upon high-B supply, BOR1 is rapidly internalized and degraded in the vacuole. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization and B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 are mediated by endocytosis from the plasma membrane. To dissect the endocytic pathways mediating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization and vacuolar sorting, we investigated the contribution of the clathrin adaptor protein, ADAPTOR PROTEIN2 (AP2) complex, to BOR1 trafficking. In the mutants lacking µ- or σ-subunits of the AP2 complex, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization and constitutive endocytosis of BOR1 under low-B conditions were dramatically disturbed. A coimmunoprecipitation assay showed association of the AP2 complex with BOR1, while it was independent of YxxΦ sorting motifs, which are in a cytosolic loop of BOR1. A yeast two-hybrid assay supported the interaction of the AP2 complex µ-subunit with the C-terminal tail but not with the YxxΦ motifs in the cytosolic loop of BOR1. Intriguingly, lack of the AP2 subunit did not affect the B-induced rapid internalization/vacuolar sorting of BOR1. Consistent with defects in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization, the AP2 complex mutants showed hypersensitivity to B deficiency. Our results indicate that AP2-dependent endocytosis maintains the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> localization of BOR1 to support plant growth under low-B conditions, whereas the B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 is mediated through an AP2-independent endocytic pathway.</p>

Rice Morphology Determinant-Mediated Actin Filament Organization Contributes to Pollen Tube Growth
<p>For successful fertilization in angiosperms, rapid tip growth in pollen tubes delivers the male gamete into the ovules. The actin-binding protein-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton within the pollen tube plays a crucial role in this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized process. However, the mechanism underlying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity of the actin filament (F-actin) array and behaviors in pollen tube growth remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that an actin-organizing protein, Rice Morphology Determinant (RMD), a type II formin from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), controls pollen tube growth by modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity and distribution of the F-actin array. The rice <i>rmd</i> mutant exhibits abnormal pollen tube growth and a decreased germination rate of the pollen grain in vitro and in vivo. The <i>rmd</i> pollen tubes display a disorganized F-actin pattern with disrupted apical actin density and shank longitudinal cable direction/arrangement, indicating the novel role of RMD in F-actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity during tip growth. Consistent with this role, RMD localizes at the tip of the rice pollen tube, which is essential for pollen tube growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity as well as F-actin organization. Furthermore, the direction and characteristics of the RMD-guided F-actin array positively regulate the deposition of cell wall components and the pattern and velocity of cytoplasmic streaming during rice pollen tube growth. Collectively, our results suggest that RMD is essential for the spatial regulation of pollen tube growth via modulating F-actin organization and array orientation in rice. This work provides insights into tip-focused cell growth and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity.</p>

Counter-propagating charge transport in the quantum Hall effect regime
<p>The quantum Hall effect, observed in a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field, imposes a 1D-like chiral, downstream, transport of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e carriers along the sample edges. Although this picture remains valid for electrons and Laughlin’s fractional quasiparticles, it no longer holds for quasiparticles in the so-called hole-conjugate states. These states are expected, when disorder and interactions are weak, to harbor upstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e modes. However, so far, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e currents were observed to flow exclusively downstream in the quantum Hall regime.

Crystallization and vitrification of electrons in a glass-forming charge liquid
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e ordering (CO) is a phenomenon in which electrons in solids crystallize into a periodic pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e-rich and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e-poor sites owing to strong electron correlations. This usually results in long-range order. In geometrically frustrated systems, however, a glassy electronic state without long-range CO has been observed. We found that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e-ordered organic material with an isosceles triangular lattice shows <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e dynamics associated with crystallization and vitrification of electrons, which can be understood in the context of an energy landscape arising from the degeneracy of various CO patterns. The dynamics suggest that the same nucleation and growth processes that characterize conventional glass-forming liquids guide the crystallization of electrons. These similarities may provide insight into our understanding of the liquid-glass transition.</p>

Global mRNA polarization regulates translation efficiency in the intestinal epithelium
<p>Asymmetric messenger RNA (mRNA) localization facilitates efficient translation in cells such as neurons and fibroblasts. However, the extent and importance of mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization in epithelial tissues are unclear. Here, we used single-molecule transcript imaging and subcellular transcriptomics to uncover global apical-basal intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization of mRNA in the mouse intestinal epithelium. The localization of mRNAs did not generally overlap protein localization. Instead, ribosomes were more abundant on the apical sides, and apical transcripts were consequently more efficiently translated. Refeeding of fasted mice elicited a basal-to-apical shift in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, which was associated with a specific boost in their translation. This led to increased protein production, required for efficient nutrient absorption. These findings reveal a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism involving dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization of mRNA and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized translation.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
RopGEF1 Plays a Critical Role in Polar Auxin Transport in Early Development
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport, facilitated by the combined activities of auxin influx and efflux carriers to maintain asymmetric auxin distribution, is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>RopGEF1</i>, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs), is critically involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> distribution of auxin influx carrier AUX1 and differential accumulation of efflux carriers PIN7 and PIN2 and is important for embryo and early seedling development when RopGEF1 is prevalently expressed. Knockdown or knockout of <i>RopGEF1</i> induces embryo defects, cotyledon vein breaks, and delayed root gravity responses. Altered expression from the auxin response reporter <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in the root pole of <i>RopGEF1</i>-deficient embryos and loss of asymmetric distribution of <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in their gravistimulated root tips suggest that auxin distribution is affected in <i>ropgef1</i> mutants. This is reflected by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity of AUX1 being altered in <i>ropgef1</i> embryos and roots, shifting from the normal apical membrane location to a basal location in embryo central vascular and root protophloem cells and also reduced PIN7 accumulation at embryos and altered PIN2 distribution in gravistimulated roots of mutant seedlings. In establishing that RopGEF1 is critical for AUX1 localization and PIN differential accumulation, our results reveal a role for RopGEF1 in cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport whereby it imapcts auxin-mediated plant growth and development.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Brown and Polar Bear Y Chromosomes Reveal Extensive Male-Biased Gene Flow within Brother Lineages
<p>Brown and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> bears have become prominent examples in phylogeography, but previous phylogeographic studies relied largely on maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or were geographically restricted. The male-specific Y chromosome, a natural counterpart to mtDNA, has remained underexplored. Although this paternally inherited chromosome is indispensable for comprehensive analyses of phylogeographic patterns, technical difficulties and low variability have hampered its application in most mammals. We developed 13 novel Y-chromosomal sequence and microsatellite markers from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> bear genome and screened these in a broad geographic sample of 130 brown and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> bears. We also analyzed a 390-kb-long Y-chromosomal scaffold using sequencing data from published male ursine genomes. Y chromosome evidence support the emerging understanding that brown and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> bears started to diverge no later than the Middle Pleistocene. Contrary to mtDNA patterns, we found 1) brown and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> bears to be reciprocally monophyletic sister (or rather brother) lineages, without signals of introgression, 2) male-biased gene flow across continents and on phylogeographic time scales, and 3) male dispersal that links the Alaskan ABC islands population to mainland brown bears. Due to female philopatry, mtDNA provides a highly structured estimate of population differentiation, while male-biased gene flow is a homogenizing force for nuclear genetic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of analyzing both maternally and paternally inherited loci for a comprehensive view of phylogeographic history, and that mtDNA-based phylogeographic studies of many mammals should be reevaluated. Recent advances in sequencing technology render the analysis of Y-chromosomal variation feasible, even in nonmodel organisms.</p>

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p>Lipid A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. Lipid A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the phosphates of lipid A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different lipid A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the lipid A phosphates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory protein PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional phosphate group to lipid A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modification of the lipid A phosphates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e more than does pEtN, modification of lipid A phosphates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in lipid A negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e. Our findings demonstrate how bacteria tailor their cell surface to different stresses, such as those faced inside phagocytes.</p>

Spin transport in a Mott insulator of ultracold fermions

Defibrillation of soft porous metal-organic frameworks with electric fields
<p>Gas transport through metal-organic framework membranes (MOFs) was switched in situ by applying an external electric field (E-field). The switching of gas permeation upon E-field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization could be explained by the structural transformation of the zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-8 into polymorphs with more rigid lattices.

Single-atom mutations that inhibit this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transfer hinder primase initiation without affecting primase structure or polymerization.

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root transition zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the transition zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport, which peaked in the root transition zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the transition zone. Our results suggest that B promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

SHADE AVOIDANCE 4 Is Required for Proper Auxin Distribution in the Hypocotyl
<p>The phytohormone auxin is involved in virtually every aspect of plant growth and development. Through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport, auxin gradients can be established, which then direct plant differentiation and growth. Shade avoidance responses are well-known processes that require <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> auxin transport. In this study, we have identified a mutant, <i>shade avoidance 4</i> (<i>sav4</i>), defective in shade-induced hypocotyl elongation and basipetal auxin transport. <i>SAV4</i> encodes an unknown protein with armadillo repeat- and tetratricopeptide repeat-like domains known to provide protein-protein interaction surfaces. C terminally yellow fluorescent protein-tagged SAV4 localizes to both the plasma membrane and the nucleus. Membrane-localized SAV4 displays a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> association with the shootward plasma membrane domain in hypocotyl and root cells, which appears to be necessary for its function in hypocotyl elongation. Cotransfection of SAV4 and ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) auxin transporter in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) revealed that SAV4 blocks ABCB1-mediated auxin efflux. We thus propose that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ly localized SAV4 acts to inhibit ABCB-mediated auxin efflux toward shoots and facilitates the establishment of proper auxin gradients.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Framework for Lateral Membrane Trafficking and Polar Tethering of the PEN3 ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter
<p>The outermost cell layer of plants, the epidermis, and its outer (lateral) membrane domain facing the environment are continuously challenged by biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, the epidermis and the outer membrane domain provide important selective and protective barriers. However, only a small number of specifically outer membrane-localized proteins are known. Similarly, molecular mechanisms underlying the trafficking and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> placement of outer membrane domain proteins require further exploration. Here, we demonstrate that ACTIN7 (ACT7) mediates trafficking of the PENETRATION3 (PEN3) outer membrane protein from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane in the root epidermis of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and that actin function contributes to PEN3 endocytic recycling. In contrast to such generic ACT7-dependent trafficking from the TGN, the EXOCYST84b (EXO84b) tethering factor mediates PEN3 outer-membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity. Moreover, precise EXO84b placement at the outer membrane domain itself requires ACT7 function. Hence, our results uncover spatially and mechanistically distinct requirements for ACT7 function during outer lateral membrane cargo trafficking and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity establishment. They further identify an exocyst tethering complex mediator of outer lateral membrane cargo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity.</p>

Genome- and Phenome-Wide Analyses of Cardiac Conduction Identifies Markers of Arrhythmia Risk
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>ECG QRS duration, a measure of cardiac intraventricular conduction, varies ≈2-fold in individuals without cardiac disease. Slow conduction may promote re-entrant arrhythmias.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genomic markers of QRS duration in 5272 individuals without cardiac disease selected from electronic medical record algorithms at 5 sites in the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network. The most significant loci were evaluated within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium QRS genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Twenty-three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 loci, previously described by CHARGE, were replicated in the eMERGE samples; 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were in the chromosome 3 <i>SCN5A</i> and <i>SCN10A</i> loci, where the most significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were rs1805126 in <i>SCN5A</i> with <i>P</i>=1.2×10<sup>−8</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=2.5×10<sup>−20</sup> (CHARGE) and rs6795970 in <i>SCN10A</i> with <i>P</i>=6×10<sup>−6</sup> (eMERGE) and <i>P</i>=5×10<sup>−27</sup> (CHARGE). The other loci were in <i>NFIA</i>, near <i>CDKN1A</i>, and near <i>C6orf204.</i> We then performed phenome-wide association studies on variants in these 5 loci in 13859 European Americans to search for diagnoses associated with these markers. Phenome-wide association study identified atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrhythmias as the most common associated diagnoses with <i>SCN10A</i> and <i>SCN5A</i> variants. <i>SCN10A</i> variants were also associated with subsequent development of atrial fibrillation and arrhythmia in the original 5272 “heart-healthy” study population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>We conclude that DNA biobanks coupled to electronic medical records not only provide a platform for genome-wide association study but also may allow broad interrogation of the longitudinal incidence of disease associated with genetic variants.

Lgl reduces endosomal vesicle acidification and Notch signaling by promoting the interaction between Vap33 and the V-ATPase complex
<p>Epithelial cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity is linked to the control of tissue growth and tumorigenesis. The tumor suppressor and cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity protein lethal-2-giant larvae (Lgl) promotes Hippo signaling and inhibits Notch signaling to restrict tissue growth in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Notch signaling is greater in <i>lgl</i> mutant tissue than in wild-type tissue because of increased acidification of endosomal vesicles, which promotes the proteolytic processing and activation of Notch by γ-secretase. We showed that the increased Notch signaling and tissue growth defects of <i>lgl</i> mutant tissue depended on endosomal vesicle acidification mediated by the vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase). Lgl promoted the activity of the V-ATPase by interacting with Vap33 (VAMP-associated protein of 33 kDa). Vap33 physically and genetically interacted with Lgl and V-ATPase subunits and repressed V-ATPase–mediated endosomal vesicle acidification and Notch signaling. Vap33 overexpression reduced the abundance of the V-ATPase component Vha44, whereas Lgl knockdown reduced the binding of Vap33 to the V-ATPase component Vha68-3. Our data indicate that Lgl promotes the binding of Vap33 to the V-ATPase, thus inhibiting V-ATPase–mediated endosomal vesicle acidification and thereby reducing γ-secretase activity, Notch signaling, and tissue growth. Our findings implicate the deregulation of Vap33 and V-ATPase activity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ity-impaired epithelial cancers.</p>

Quantum-critical conductivity of the Dirac fluid in graphene
<p>Graphene near <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e neutrality is expected to behave like a quantum-critical, relativistic plasma—the “Dirac fluid”—in which massless electrons and holes collide at a rapid rate. We used on-chip terahertz spectroscopy to measure the frequency-dependent optical conductivity of clean, micrometer-scale graphene at electron temperatures between 77 and 300 kelvin. At <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e neutrality, we observed the quantum-critical scattering rate characteristic of the Dirac fluid. At higher doping, we detected two distinct current-carrying modes with zero and nonzero total momenta, a manifestation of relativistic hydrodynamics.

A Josephson relation for fractionally charged anyons

Their dynamics are of utmost importance for topological quantum phases and possible decoherence-free quantum information approaches, but observing these dynamics experimentally is challenging.

The relation manifests itself as marked signatures in the dependence of photo-assisted shot noise (PASN) on voltage <i>V</i> when irradiating contacts at microwaves frequency <i>f</i><sub>J</sub>. The validation of FQHE PASN models indicates a path toward realizing time-resolved anyon sources based on levitons.</p>

Dynamic response and hydrodynamics of polarized crowds
<p>Modeling crowd motion is central to situations as diverse as risk prevention in mass events and visual effects rendering in the motion picture industry. The difficulty of performing quantitative measurements in model experiments has limited our ability to model pedestrian flows. We use tens of thousands of road-race participants in starting corrals to elucidate the flowing behavior of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized crowds by probing its response to boundary motion. We establish that speed information propagates over system-spanning scales through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized crowds, whereas orientational fluctuations are locally suppressed. Building on these observations, we lay out a hydrodynamic theory of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized crowds and demonstrate its predictive power.

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings

The belt extends across the D-ring and comprises protons produced through cosmic ray albedo neutron decay and multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e-exchange reactions. These protons are lost to atmospheric neutrals and D-ring dust.

Anomalously low dielectric constant of confined water
<p>The dielectric constant ε of interfacial water has been predicted to be smaller than that of bulk water (ε ≈ 80) because the rotational freedom of water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dipol</span></strong>es is expected to decrease near surfaces, yet experimental evidence is lacking. We report local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capacit</span></strong>ance measurements for water confined between two atomically flat walls separated by various distances down to 1 nanometer. Our experiments reveal the presence of an interfacial layer with vanishingly small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization such that its out-of-plane ε is only ~2. The electrically dead layer is found to be two to three molecules thick. These results provide much-needed feedback for theories describing water-mediated surface interactions and the behavior of interfacial water, and show a way to investigate the dielectric properties of other fluids and solids under extreme confinement.</p>

Separation of enantiomers by their enantiospecific interaction with achiral magnetic substrates
<p>It is commonly assumed that recognition and discrimination of chirality, both in nature and in artificial systems, depend solely on spatial effects. However, recent studies have suggested that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e redistribution in chiral molecules manifests an enantiospecific preference in electron spin orientation. We therefore reasoned that the induced spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization may affect enantiorecognition through exchange interactions. Here we show experimentally that the interaction of chiral molecules with a perpendicularly magnetized substrate is enantiospecific. Thus, one enantiomer adsorbs preferentially when the magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dipol</span></strong>e is pointing up, whereas the other adsorbs faster for the opposite alignment of the magnetization. The interaction is not controlled by the magnetic field per se, but rather by the electron spin orientations, and opens prospects for a distinct approach to enantiomeric separations.</p>

A nonconjugated radical polymer glass with high electrical conductivity
<p>Solid-state conducting polymers usually have highly conjugated macromolecular backbones and require intentional doping in order to achieve high electrical conductivities. Conversely, single-component, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e-neutral macromolecules could be synthetically simpler and have improved processibility and ambient stability. We show that poly(4-glycidyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl), a nonconjugated radical polymer with a subambient glass transition temperature, underwent rapid solid-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transfer reactions and had an electrical conductivity of up to 28 siemens per meter over channel lengths up to 0.6 micrometers. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transport through the radical polymer film was enabled with thermal annealing at 80°C, which allowed for the formation of a percolating network of open-shell sites in electronic communication with one another. The electrical conductivity was not enhanced by intentional doping, and thin films of this material showed high optical transparency.</p>

Polarity compensation mechanisms on the perovskite surface KTaO<sub>3</sub>(001)

The as-cleaved surface in vacuum is frozen in place but immediately responds with an insulator-to-metal transition and possibly ferroelectric lattice distortions. Annealing in vacuum allows the formation of isolated oxygen vacancies, followed by a complete rearrangement of the top layers into an ordered pattern of KO and TaO<sub>2</sub> stripes.

Chiromagnetic nanoparticles and gels
<p>Chiral inorganic nanostructures have high circular dichroism, but real-time control of their optical activity has so far been achieved only by irreversible chemical changes. Field modulation is a far more desirable path to chiroptical devices. We hypothesized that magnetic field modulation can be attained for chiral nanostructures with large contributions of the magnetic transition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dipol</span></strong>e moments to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization rotation. We found that dispersions and gels of paramagnetic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with chiral distortions of the crystal lattices exhibited chiroptical activity in the visible range that was 10 times as strong as that of nonparamagnetic nanoparticles of comparable size. Transparency of the nanoparticle gels to circularly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized light beams in the ultraviolet range was reversibly modulated by magnetic fields. These phenomena were also observed for other nanoscale metal oxides with lattice distortions from imprinted amino acids and other chiral ligands.

Arbitrary spin-to–orbital angular momentum conversion of light
<p>Optical elements that convert the spin angular momentum (SAM) of light into vortex beams have found applications in classical and quantum optics.

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p>Water storage is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant water balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to water storage can be derived from rehydration and water-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with water, water uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high water storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capacit</span></strong>ance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and water storage. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that storage compartments for capillary water refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capacit</span></strong>ance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain storage compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e/re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e of stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capacit</span></strong>ance in an intact tree.</p>

Electronic crystal growth
<p>Interacting atoms or molecules condense into liquid, and, when cooled further, they form a crystal. The time evolution of the atomic or molecular ordering has been widely studied as a nonequilibrium emergence of order from a supercooled liquid or a glass. Interacting electrons in a variety of correlated electron systems also form crystals, but observing the time evolution of electronic crystallization has been experimentally challenging. Here, working with an organic conductor exhibiting a supercooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e liquid or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e glass as a metastable state, we observed electronic crystal growth through resistivity and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The temperature profile of the crystal growth is similar to those observed in classical systems and reveals two distinct regimes for the mechanism of electronic crystallization.</p>

A molecular spin-photovoltaic device
<p>We fabricated a C<sub>60</sub> fullerene–based molecular spin-photovoltaic device that integrates a photovoltaic response with the spin transport across the molecular layer. The photovoltaic response can be modified under the application of a small magnetic field, with a magnetophotovoltage of up to 5% at room temperature. Device functionalities include a magnetic current inverter and the presence of diverging magnetocurrent at certain illumination levels that could be useful for sensing. Completely spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized currents can be created by balancing the external partially spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized injection with the photogenerated carriers.</p>

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators
<p>Topological phases, like the Haldane phase in spin-1 chains, defy characterization through local order parameters. Instead, nonlocal string order parameters can be employed to reveal their hidden order. Similar diluted magnetic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e separation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden magnetic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of nonlocal spin-density correlation functions reveals a hidden finite-range antiferromagnetic order, a direct consequence of spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e separation. Our technique, which measures nonlocal order directly, can be readily extended to higher dimensions to study the complex interplay between magnetic order and density fluctuations.</p>

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices
<p>Cyclotron motion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e carriers in metals and semiconductors leads to Landau quantization and magneto-oscillatory behavior in their properties. Cryogenic temperatures are usually required to observe these oscillations. We show that graphene superlattices support a different type of quantum oscillation that does not rely on Landau quantization. The oscillations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e carriers experience effectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Our work hints at unexplored physics in Hofstadter butterfly systems at high temperatures.</p>

Quantized electric multipole insulators
<p>The Berry phase provides a modern formulation of electric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization in crystals. We extend this concept to higher electric multipole moments and determine the necessary conditions and minimal models for which the quadrupole and octupole moments are topologically quantized electromagnetic observables. Such systems exhibit gapped boundaries that are themselves lower-dimensional topological phases. Furthermore, they host topologically protected corner states carrying fractional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e, exhibiting fractionalization at the boundary of the boundary. To characterize these insulating phases of matter, we introduce a paradigm in which “nested” Wilson loops give rise to topological invariants that have been overlooked. We propose three realistic experimental implementations of this topological behavior that can be immediately tested. Our work opens a venue for the expansion of the classification of topological phases of matter.</p>

Jupiter’s magnetosphere and aurorae observed by the Juno spacecraft during its first polar orbits
<p>The Juno spacecraft acquired direct observations of the jovian magnetosphere and auroral emissions from a vantage point above the poles. Juno’s capture orbit spanned the jovian magnetosphere from bow shock to the planet, providing magnetic field, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>ed particle, and wave phenomena context for Juno’s passage over the poles and traverse of Jupiter’s hazardous inner radiation belts. Juno’s energetic particle and plasma detectors measured electrons precipitating in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong> regions, exciting intense aurorae, observed simultaneously by the ultraviolet and infrared imaging spectrographs. Juno transited beneath the most intense parts of the radiation belts, passed about 4000 kilometers above the cloud tops at closest approach, well inside the jovian rings, and recorded the electrical signatures of high-velocity impacts with small particles as it traversed the equator.</p>

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation
<p>The electronic properties of graphene can give rise to a range of nonlinear optical responses. One of the most desirable nonlinear optical processes is high-harmonic generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron motion induced by an intense light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in graphene excited by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ized laser excitation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">polar</span></strong>ization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions.</p>

All-printed thin-film transistors from networks of liquid-exfoliated nanosheets
<p>All-printed transistors consisting of interconnected networks of various types of two-dimensional nanosheets are an important goal in nanoscience. Using electrolytic gating, we demonstrate all-printed, vertically stacked transistors with graphene source, drain, and gate electrodes, a transition metal dichalcogenide channel, and a boron nitride (BN) separator, all formed from nanosheet networks. The BN network contains an ionic liquid within its porous interior that allows electrolytic gating in a solid-like structure. Nanosheet network channels display on:off ratios of up to 600, transconductances exceeding 5 millisiemens, and mobilities of >0.1 square centimeters per volt per second. Unusually, the on-currents scaled with network thickness and volumetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capacit</span></strong>ance. In contrast to other devices with comparable mobility, large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">capacit</span></strong>ances, while hindering switching speeds, allow these devices to carry higher currents at relatively low drive voltages.</p>

Anomalously low electronic thermal conductivity in metallic vanadium dioxide
<p>In electrically conductive solids, the Wiedemann-Franz law requires the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity to be proportional to electrical conductivity. Violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law are typically an indication of unconventional quasiparticle dynamics, such as inelastic scattering, or hydrodynamic collective motion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e carriers, typically pronounced only at cryogenic temperatures. We report an order-of-magnitude breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law at high temperatures ranging from 240 to 340 kelvin in metallic vanadium dioxide in the vicinity of its metal-insulator transition. Different from previously established mechanisms, the unusually low electronic thermal conductivity is a signature of the absence of quasiparticles in a strongly correlated electron fluid where heat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e diffuse independently.</p>

Highly stretchable polymer semiconductor films through the nanoconfinement effect
<p>Soft and conformable wearable electronics require stretchable semiconductors, but existing ones typically sacrifice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transport mobility to achieve stretchability. We explore a concept based on the nanoconfinement of polymers to substantially improve the stretchability of polymer semiconductors, without affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">charg</span></strong>e transport mobility. The increased polymer chain dynamics under nanoconfinement significantly reduces the modulus of the conjugated polymer and largely delays the onset of crack formation under strain. As a result, our fabricated semiconducting film can be stretched up to 100% strain without affecting mobility, retaining values comparable to that of amorphous silicon. The fully stretchable transistors exhibit high biaxial stretchability with minimal change in on current even when poked with a sharp object. We demonstrate a skinlike finger-wearable driver for a light-emitting diode.</p>

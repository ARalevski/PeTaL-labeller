Disparities in science literacy
<p>Much is known about how adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy varies internationally and over time, and about its association with attitudes and beliefs. However, less is known about disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy across racial and ethnic groups (<i>1</i>). This is particularly surprising in light of substantial research on racial and ethnic disparities in related areas such as educational achievement, math and reading ability (<i>2</i>), representation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) occupations (<i>3</i>), and health literacy (<i>4</i>). Given the importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy to securing and sustaining many jobs, to understanding key health concepts to enhance quality of life, and to increasing public engagement in societal decision-making (<i>5</i>), it is concerning if the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy is unequally stratified, particularly if this stratification reflects broader patterns of disadvantage and cultural dominance as experienced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ities and educationally underserved populations. We describe here such disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy in the United States and attempt to explain underlying drivers, concluding that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy disadvantage among black and Hispanic adults relative to whites is only partially explained by measures of broader, foundational literacies and socioeconomic status (SES).</p>

Urbanization and humidity shape the intensity of influenza epidemics in U.S. cities
<p>Influenza epidemics vary in intensity from year to year, driven by climatic conditions and by viral antigenic evolution. However, important spatial variation remains unexplained. Here we show predictable differences in influenza incidence among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">citi</span></strong>es, driven by population size and structure. Weekly incidence data from 603 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">citi</span></strong>es in the United States reveal that epidemics in smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">citi</span></strong>es are focused on shorter periods of the influenza season, whereas in larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">citi</span></strong>es, incidence is more diffuse. Base transmission potential estimated from city-level incidence data is positively correlated with population size and with spatiotemporal organization in population density, indicating a milder response to climate forcing in metropolises. This suggests that urban centers incubate critical chains of transmission outside of peak climatic conditions, altering the spatiotemporal geometry of herd immunity.</p>

Replicating Meyerhoff for inclusive excellence in STEM
<p>Ethnic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ities comprise rapidly growing portions of the populations of most developed countries (<i>1</i>) but are underrepresented in fields of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) (<i>2</i>, <i>3</i>). Efforts to increase diversity in the STEM workforce, important for developing more effective approaches to group problem-solving (<i>4</i>–<i>6</i>), have been under way in the United States for decades, but widespread impact remains relatively low (<i>3</i>). The Meyerhoff Scholars Program (MYS) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), provides a promising model for increasing retention and academic performance of underrepresented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ity (URM) undergraduates in STEM and for preparing those undergraduates to pursue and succeed in graduate and professional programs (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>). Although MYS is nearly 30 years old and outcomes for African-American STEM majors have been extensively documented [see (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and references therein], no other majority university [not meeting the definition of being a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ity-serving institution (MSI) (<i>9</i>)] has achieved similar outcomes (<i>10</i>). We describe here some promising early indicators that an interinstitutional partnership approach can help enable MYS-like outcomes at majority universities with different URM compositions, geographies, and institutional sizes and cultures: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and Pennsylvania State University at University Park (PSU).</p>

1.9-million- and 2.4-million-year-old artifacts and stone tool–cutmarked bones from Ain Boucherit, Algeria
<p>East Africa has provided the earliest known evidence for Oldowan stone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">artifact</span></strong>s and hominin-induced stone tool cutmarks dated to ~2.6 million years (Ma) ago. The ~1.8-million-year-old stone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">artifact</span></strong>s from Ain Hanech (Algeria) were considered to represent the oldest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">archaeolog</span></strong>ical materials in North Africa. Here we report older stone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">artifact</span></strong>s and cutmarked bones excavated from two nearby deposits at Ain Boucherit estimated to ~1.9 Ma ago, and the older to ~2.4 Ma ago. Hence, the Ain Boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the Mediterranean fringe in northern Africa much earlier than previously thought. The evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from East Africa or a possible multiple-origin scenario of stone technology in both East and North Africa.</p>

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, genetics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>es, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the availability of genetic and genomic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Echoes of Ebola as plague hits Madagascar
<p>Hundreds of epidemiologists and technical experts are pouring into Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world, to help fight an unprecedented plague epidemic. By 20 October, 1297 people had been infected and 102 had died, and cases are doubling weekly. Worries are high that the outbreak will spread to nearby countries and territories in Africa and the Indian Ocean, where governments are scrambling to prepare. Madagascar is one of the few countries in the world still hard hit by plague, which decimated Europe's population during the Black Death in the Middle Ages. The disease is endemic in the central highlands, where small outbreaks occur most years. Most are bubonic plague, transmitted from rats to humans by the bite of a flea. Now, for the first time, plague is hitting urban areas, including Antananarivo, the capital, and the port city Toamasina, and it has taken an unusual and especially menacing form: pneumonic plague, which is spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing. Without treatment, pneumonic plague is 100% fatal. Infectious disease experts say the outbreak underscores one lesson of the Ebola epidemic of 2 years ago: As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">citi</span></strong>es burgeon and populations become more mobile, once-isolated diseases are increasingly likely to reach <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">citi</span></strong>es, where they can race out of control.</p>

Persistent effects of pre-Columbian plant domestication on Amazonian forest composition
<p>The extent to which pre-Columbian societies altered Amazonian landscapes is hotly debated. We performed a basin-wide analysis of pre-Columbian impacts on Amazonian forests by overlaying known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">archaeolog</span></strong>ical sites in Amazonia with the distributions and abundances of 85 woody species domesticated by pre-Columbian peoples. Domesticated species are five times more likely than nondomesticated species to be hyperdominant. Across the basin, the relative abundance and richness of domesticated species increase in forests on and around <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">archaeolog</span></strong>ical sites. In southwestern and eastern Amazonia, distance to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">archaeolog</span></strong>ical sites strongly influences the relative abundance and richness of domesticated species. Our analyses indicate that modern tree communities in Amazonia are structured to an important extent by a long history of plant domestication by Amazonian peoples.</p>

Multiproxy evidence highlights a complex evolutionary legacy of maize in South America
<p>Domesticated maize evolved from wild teosinte under human influences in Mexico beginning around 9000 years before the present (yr B.P.), traversed Central America by ~7500 yr B.P., and spread into South America by ~6500 yr B.P. Landrace and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">archaeolog</span></strong>ical maize genomes from South America suggest that the ancestral population to South American maize was brought out of the domestication center in Mexico and became isolated from the wild teosinte gene pool before traits of domesticated maize were fixed. Deeply structured lineages then evolved within South America out of this partially domesticated progenitor population. Genomic, linguistic, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">archaeolog</span></strong>ical, and paleoecological data suggest that the southwestern Amazon was a secondary improvement center for partially domesticated maize. Multiple waves of human-mediated dispersal are responsible for the diversity and biogeography of modern South American maize.</p>

Ancient lowland Maya complexity as revealed by airborne laser scanning of northern Guatemala
<p>Lowland Maya civilization flourished in the tropical region of the Yucatan peninsula and environs for more than 2500 years (~1000 BCE to 1500 CE). Known for its sophistication in writing, art, architecture, astronomy, and mathematics, Maya civilization still poses questions about the nature of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">citi</span></strong>es and surrounding populations because of its location in an inaccessible forest. In 2016, an aerial lidar survey across 2144 square kilometers of northern Guatemala mapped natural terrain and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">archaeolog</span></strong>ical features over several distinct areas. We present results from these data, revealing interconnected urban settlement and landscapes with extensive infrastructural development. Studied through a joint international effort of interdisciplinary teams sharing protocols, this lidar survey compels a reevaluation of Maya demography, agriculture, and political economy and suggests future avenues of field research.</p>

Experimental evidence for tipping points in social convention
<p>Theoretical models of critical mass have shown how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ity groups can initiate social change dynamics in the emergence of new social conventions. Here, we study an artificial system of social conventions in which human subjects interact to establish a new coordination equilibrium. The findings provide direct empirical demonstration of the existence of a tipping point in the dynamics of changing social conventions. When <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ity groups reached the critical mass—that is, the critical group size for initiating social change—they were consistently able to overturn the established behavior. The size of the required critical mass is expected to vary based on theoretically identifiable features of a social setting. Our results show that the theoretically predicted dynamics of critical mass do in fact emerge as expected within an empirical system of social coordination.</p>

Vaccine trial launched to stop Ebola
<p>On 8 May, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) announced that a new Ebola outbreak was underway in a remote part of the country, and within 3 days, the government decided for the first time to use an experimental vaccine to help stop spread. The vaccine performed well in a large clinical trial held in Guinea in 2015, but it remains unlicensed and technically can only be used as part of a new study. The DRC hopes the vaccine will add to traditional containment efforts like quarantine for the infected and protective gear for medical teams and prevent the outbreak from exploding into a full-blown epidemic, as happened in West Africa in 2014. As <i>Science</i> went to press, the DRC had two confirmed and 39 probable and suspected cases in three different health districts. Most concerning, two of the probable cases are in Mbandaka, a city that has 1.2 million residents. In addition to helping the DRC launch the vaccine trial, the international community has responded in full force, quickly sending in teams of experts to help with surveillance, testing, and treatment for the infected.</p>

Natural selection interacts with recombination to shape the evolution of hybrid genomes
<p>To investigate the consequences of hybridization between species, we studied three replicate hybrid populations that formed naturally between two swordtail fish species, estimating their fine-scale genetic map and inferring ancestry along the genomes of 690 individuals. In all three populations, ancestry from the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>” parental species is more common in regions of high recombination and where there is linkage to fewer putative targets of selection. The same patterns are apparent in a reanalysis of human and archaic admixture. These results support models in which ancestry from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> parental species is more likely to persist when rapidly uncoupled from alleles that are deleterious in hybrids. Our analyses further indicate that selection on swordtail hybrids stems predominantly from deleterious combinations of epistatically interacting alleles.</p>

Chronology of the Acheulean to Middle Stone Age transition in eastern Africa
<p>The origin of the Middle Stone Age (MSA) marks the transition from a highly persistent mode of stone toolmaking, the Acheulean, to a period of increasing technological innovation and cultural indicators associated with the evolution of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. We used argon-40/argon-39 and uranium-series dating to calibrate the chronology of Acheulean and early MSA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">artifact</span></strong>–rich sedimentary deposits in the Olorgesailie basin, southern Kenya rift. We determined the age of late Acheulean tool assemblages from 615,000 to 499,000 years ago, after which a large technological and faunal transition occurred, with a definitive MSA lacking Acheulean elements beginning most likely by ~320,000 years ago, but at least by 305,000 years ago. These results establish the oldest repository of MSA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">artifact</span></strong>s in eastern Africa.</p>

Anatomy of STEM teaching in North American universities

Many educational and governmental bodies have called for and supported adoption of these student-centered strategies throughout the undergraduate STEM curriculum. But to the extent that we have pictures of the STEM undergraduate instructional landscape, it has mostly been provided through self-report surveys of faculty members, within a particular STEM discipline [e.g., (<i>3</i>–<i>6</i>)]. Such surveys are prone to reliability threats and can underestimate the complexity of classroom environments, and few are implemented nationally to provide valid and reliable data (<i>7</i>). Reflecting the limited state of these data, a report from the U.S. National Academies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>es, Engineering, and Medicine called for improved data collection to understand the use of evidence-based instructional practices (<i>8</i>).

Neandertal and Denisovan DNA from Pleistocene sediments
<p>Although a rich record of Pleistocene human-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">archaeolog</span></strong>ical assemblages exists, the scarcity of hominin fossils often impedes the understanding of which hominins occupied a site. Using targeted enrichment of mitochondrial DNA, we show that cave sediments represent a rich source of ancient mammalian DNA that often includes traces of hominin DNA, even at sites and in layers where no hominin remains have been discovered. By automation-assisted screening of numerous sediment samples, we detected Neandertal DNA in eight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">archaeolog</span></strong>ical layers from four caves in Eurasia. In Denisova Cave, we retrieved Denisovan DNA in a Middle Pleistocene layer near the bottom of the stratigraphy.

Loss of the Chloroplast Transit Peptide from an Ancestral C<sub>3</sub> Carbonic Anhydrase Is Associated with C<sub>4</sub> Evolution in the Grass Genus <i>Neurachne</i>
<p><i>Neurachne</i> is the only known grass lineage containing closely related C<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> intermediate, and C<sub>4</sub> species, making it an ideal taxon with which to study the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in the grasses. To begin dissecting the molecular changes that led to the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in this group, the complementary DNAs encoding four distinct β-carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms were characterized from leaf tissue of <i>Neurachne munroi</i> (C<sub>4</sub>), <i>Neurachne <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong></i> (C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>), and <i>Neurachne alopecuroidea</i> (C<sub>3</sub>). Two genes (<i>CA1</i> and <i>CA2</i>) each encode two different isoforms: CA1a/CA1b and CA2a/CA2b. Transcript analyses found that <i>CA1</i> messenger RNAs were significantly more abundant than transcripts from the <i>CA2</i> gene in the leaves of each species examined, constituting ∼99% of all β-CA transcripts measured. Localization experiments using green fluorescent protein fusion constructs showed that, while CA1b is a cytosolic CA in all three species, the CA1a proteins are differentially localized. The <i>N. alopecuroidea</i> and <i>N. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong></i> CA1a isoforms were imported into chloroplasts of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf cells, whereas <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a localized to the cytosol. Sequence analysis indicated an 11-amino acid deletion in the amino terminus of <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a relative to the C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> proteins, suggesting that chloroplast targeting of CA1a is the ancestral state and that loss of a functional chloroplast transit peptide in <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a is associated with the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in <i>Neurachne</i> spp. Remarkably, this mechanism is homoplastic with the evolution of the C<sub>4</sub>-associated CA in the dicotyledonous genus <i>Flaveria</i>, although the actual mutations in the two lineages differ.</p>

Reversible Leaf Xylem Collapse: A Potential “Circuit Breaker” against Cavitation
<p>We report a novel form of xylem dysfunction in angiosperms: reversible collapse of the xylem conduits of the smallest vein orders that demarcate and intrusively irrigate the areoles of red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy revealed gradual increases in collapse from approximately −2 MPa down to −3 MPa, saturating thereafter (to −4 MPa). Over this range, cavitation remained negligible in these veins. Imaging of rehydration experiments showed spatially variable recovery from collapse within 20 s and complete recovery after 2 min. More broadly, the patterns of deformation induced by desiccation in both mesophyll and xylem suggest that cell wall collapse is unlikely to depend solely on individual wall properties, as mechanical constraints imposed by neighbors appear to be important. From the perspective of equilibrium leaf water potentials, petioles, whose vessels extend into the major veins, showed a vulnerability to cavitation that overlapped in the water potential domain with both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> vein collapse and buckling (turgor loss) of the living cells. However, models of transpiration transients showed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> vein collapse and mesophyll capacitance could effectively buffer major veins from cavitation over time scales relevant to the rectification of stomatal wrong-way responses. We suggest that, for angiosperms, whose subsidiary cells give up large volumes to allow large stomatal apertures at the cost of potentially large wrong-way responses, vein collapse could make an important contribution to these plants’ ability to transpire near the brink of cavitation-inducing water potentials.</p>

Evaluation of Codon Biology in <i>Citrus</i> and <i>Poncirus trifoliata</i> Based on Genomic Features and Frame Corrected Expressed Sequence Tags
<p><i>Citrus</i>, as one of the globally important fruit trees, has been an object of interest for understanding genetics and evolutionary process in fruit crops. Meta-analyses of 19 <i>Citrus</i> species, including 4 globally and economically important <i>Citrus sinensis</i>, <i>Citrus clementina</i>, <i>Citrus reticulata</i>, and 1 <i>Citrus</i> relative <i>Poncirus trifoliata</i>, were performed. We observed that codons ending with A- or T- at the wobble position were preferred in contrast to C- or G- ending codons, indicating a close association with AT richness of <i>Citrus</i> species and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. The present study postulates a large repertoire of a set of optimal codons for the <i>Citrus</i> genus and <i>P. trifoliata</i> and demonstrates that GCT and GGT are evolutionary conserved optimal codons. Our observation suggested that mutational bias is the dominating force in shaping the codon usage bias (CUB) in <i>Citrus</i> and <i>P. trifoliata</i>. Correspondence analysis (COA) revealed that the principal axis [axis 1; COA/relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)] contributes only a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> portion (∼10.96%) of the recorded variance. In all analysed species, except <i>P. trifoliata</i>, Gravy and aromaticity played <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> roles in resolving CUB.

Genetic Determinants of Dabigatran Plasma Levels and Their Relation to Bleeding
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Fixed-dose unmonitored treatment with dabigatran etexilate is effective and has a favorable safety profile in the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation patients compared with warfarin. We hypothesized that genetic variants could contribute to interindividual variability in blood concentrations of the active metabolite of dabigatran etexilate and influence the safety and efficacy of dabigatran.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We successfully conducted a genome-wide association study in 2944 Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) participants. The <i>CES1</i> single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2244613 was associated with trough concentrations, and the <i>ABCB1</i> single-nucleotide polymorphism rs4148738 and the <i>CES1</i> single-nucleotide polymorphism rs8192935 were associated with peak concentrations at genome-wide significance (<i>P</i><9×10<sup>−8</sup>) with a gene-dose effect. Each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> allele of the <i>CES1</i> single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2244613 was associated with lower trough concentrations (15% decrease per allele; 95% confidence interval, 10–19; <i>P</i>=1.2×10<sup>−8</sup>) and a lower risk of any bleeding (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.55–0.82; <i>P</i>=7×10<sup>−5</sup>) in dabigatran-treated participants, with a consistent but nonsignificant lower risk of major bleeding (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–1.01).

Deubiquitinating Enzyme OTU5 Contributes to DNA Methylation Patterns and Is Critical for Phosphate Nutrition Signals
<p>Phosphate (Pi) starvation induces a suite of adaptive responses aimed at recalibrating cellular Pi homeostasis. Plants harboring a mutation in <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) showed altered DNA methylation of root hair-related genes and altered Pi-responsive root traits. Unlike the wild type, homozygous <i>otu5</i> mutants did not respond to Pi starvation by increased lateral root formation and increased root hair length but formed very short root hairs when grown on low-Pi media. Under Pi-replete conditions, <i>otu5</i> plants developed more root hairs than the wild type due to attenuated primary root growth, a phenotype that resembled that of Pi-deficient plants. Growth of plants on low-Pi media altered both H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation levels at the transcriptional start site of a subset of genes encoding key players in Pi homeostasis, which was correlated with mRNA abundance changes of these genes. Pi starvation had a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> impact on DNA methylation. Differentially methylated regions were enriched in transposable elements, suggesting that DNA methylation associated with low Pi supply is required for maintaining genome integrity. It is concluded that DNA methylation and histone methylation constitute critical, interdependent regulatory components that orchestrate the activity of a subset of Pi-responsive genes.</p>

Regular Motifs in Xylan Modulate Molecular Flexibility and Interactions with Cellulose Surfaces
<p>Xylan is tightly associated with cellulose and lignin in secondary plant cell walls, contributing to its rigidity and structural integrity in vascular plants. However, the molecular features and the nanoscale forces that control the interactions among cellulose microfibrils, hemicelluloses, and lignin are still not well understood. Here, we combine comprehensive mass spectrometric glycan sequencing and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the substitution pattern in softwood xylans and to investigate the effect of distinct intramolecular motifs on xylan conformation and on the interaction with cellulose surfaces in Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>). We confirm the presence of motifs with evenly spaced glycosyl decorations on the xylan backbone, together with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> motifs with consecutive glucuronation. These domains are differently enriched in xylan fractions extracted by alkali and subcritical water, which indicates their preferential positioning in the secondary plant cell wall ultrastructure. The flexibility of the 3-fold screw conformation of xylan in solution is enhanced by the presence of arabinofuranosyl decorations. Additionally, molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the glycosyl substitutions in xylan are not only sterically tolerated by the cellulose surfaces but that they increase the affinity for cellulose and favor the stabilization of the 2-fold screw conformation. This effect is more significant for the hydrophobic surface compared with the hydrophilic ones, which demonstrates the importance of nonpolar driving forces on the structural integrity of secondary plant cell walls. These novel molecular insights contribute to an improved understanding of the supramolecular architecture of plant secondary cell walls and have fundamental implications for overcoming lignocellulose recalcitrance and for the design of advanced wood-based materials.</p>

PaCeQuant: A Tool for High-Throughput Quantification of Pavement Cell Shape Characteristics
<p>Pavement cells (PCs) are the most frequently occurring cell type in the leaf epidermis and play important roles in leaf growth and function. In many plant species, PCs form highly complex jigsaw-puzzle-shaped cells with interlocking lobes. Understanding of their development is of high interest for plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e research because of their importance for leaf growth and hence for plant fitness and crop yield. Studies of PC development, however, are limited, because robust methods are lacking that enable automatic segmentation and quantification of PC shape parameters suitable to reflect their cellular complexity. Here, we present our new ImageJ-based tool, PaCeQuant, which provides a fully automatic image analysis workflow for PC shape quantification. PaCeQuant automatically detects cell boundaries of PCs from confocal input images and enables manual correction of automatic segmentation results or direct import of manually segmented cells. PaCeQuant simultaneously extracts 27 shape features that include global, contour-based, skeleton-based, and PC-specific object descriptors. In addition, we included a method for classification and analysis of lobes at two-cell junctions and three-cell junctions, respectively. We provide an R script for graphical visualization and statistical analysis. We validated PaCeQuant by extensive comparative analysis to manual segmentation and existing quantification tools and demonstrated its usability to analyze PC shape characteristics during development and between different genotypes. PaCeQuant thus provides a platform for robust, efficient, and reproducible quantitative analysis of PC shape characteristics that can easily be applied to study PC development in large data sets.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.</p>

The REVEILLE Clock Genes Inhibit Growth of Juvenile and Adult Plants by Control of Cell Size
<p>The circadian clock is a complex regulatory network that enhances plant growth and fitness in a constantly changing environment. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the clock is composed of numerous regulatory feedback loops in which <i>REVEILLE8</i> (<i>RVE8</i>) and its homologs <i>RVE4</i> and <i>RVE6</i> act in a partially redundant manner to promote clock pace. Here, we report that the remaining members of the <i>RVE8</i> clade, <i>RVE3</i> and <i>RVE5</i>, play only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> roles in the regulation of clock function. However, we find that RVE8 clade proteins have unexpected functions in the modulation of light input to the clock and the control of plant growth at multiple stages of development. In seedlings, these proteins repress hypocotyl elongation in a daylength- and sucrose-dependent manner. Strikingly, adult <i>rve4 6 8</i> and <i>rve3 4 5 6 8</i> mutants are much larger than wild-type plants, with both increased leaf area and biomass. This size phenotype is associated with a faster growth rate and larger cell size and is not simply due to a delay in the transition to flowering. Gene expression and epistasis analysis reveal that the growth phenotypes of <i>rve</i> mutants are due to the misregulation of <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i> (<i>PIF4</i>) and <i>PIF5</i> expression. Our results show that even small changes in <i>PIF</i> gene expression caused by the perturbation of clock gene function can have large effects on the growth of adult plants.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ity of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Soluble and Membrane-Bound β-Glucosidases Are Involved in Trimming the Xyloglucan Backbone
<p>In many flowering plants, xyloglucan is a major component of primary cell walls, where it plays an important role in growth regulation. Xyloglucan can be degraded by a suite of exoglycosidases that remove specific sugars. In this work, we show that the xyloglucan backbone, formed by (1→4)-linked β-<sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl residues, can be attacked by two different Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) β-glucosidases from glycoside hydrolase family 3. While BGLC1 (At5g20950; for β-glucosidase active against xyloglucan 1) is responsible for all or most of the soluble activity, BGLC3 (At5g04885) is usually a membrane-anchored protein. Mutations in these two genes, whether on their own or combined with mutations in other exoglycosidase genes, resulted in the accumulation of partially digested xyloglucan subunits, such as GXXG, GXLG, or GXFG. While a mutation in <i>BGLC1</i> had significant effects on its own, lack of <i>BGLC3</i> had only <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> effects. On the other hand, double <i>bglc1 bglc3</i> mutants revealed a synergistic interaction that supports a role for membrane-bound BGLC3 in xyloglucan metabolism. In addition, <i>bglc1 bglc3</i> was complemented by overexpression of either <i>BGLC1</i> or <i>BGLC3</i>. In overexpression lines, BGLC3 activity was concentrated in a microsome-enriched fraction but also was present in soluble form. Finally, both genes were generally expressed in the same cell types, although, in some cases, <i>BGLC3</i> was expressed at earlier stages than <i>BGLC1</i>. We propose that functional specialization could explain the separate localization of both enzymes, as a membrane-bound β-glucosidase could specifically digest soluble xyloglucan without affecting the wall-bound polymer.</p>

CNGC2 Is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> Influx Channel That Prevents Accumulation of Apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the Leaf
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is absorbed by roots and transported upward through the xylem to the apoplastic space of the leaf, after which it is deposited into the leaf cell. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the tonoplast-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transporters CATION EXCHANGER1 (CAX1) and CAX3 sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the vacuole, but it is not known what transporter mediates the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the apoplast to the cytosol. Here, we report that Arabidopsis <i>CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNEL2</i> (<i>CNGC2</i>) encodes a protein with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx channel activity and is expressed in the leaf areas surrounding the free endings of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> veins, which is the primary site for Ca<sup>2+</sup> unloading from the vasculature and influx into leaf cells. Under hydroponic growth conditions, with 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup>, both Arabidopsis <i>cngc2</i> and <i>cax1cax3</i> loss-of-function mutants grew normally. Increasing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 10 m<sc>m</sc> induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, cell death, and leaf senescence and partially suppressed the hypersensitive response to avirulent pathogens in the mutants but not in the wild type. In vivo apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> overaccumulation was found in the leaves of <i>cngc2</i> and <i>cax1cax</i>3 but not the wild type under the 10 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition, as monitored by Oregon Green BAPTA 488 5N, a low-affinity and membrane-impermeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe. Our results indicate that CNGC2 likely has no direct roles in leaf development or the hypersensitive response but, instead, that CNGC2 could mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into leaf cells. Finally, the in vivo extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging method developed in this study provides a new tool for investigating Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in plant cells.</p>

Two Different Transcripts of a LAMMER Kinase Gene Play Opposite Roles in Disease Resistance
<p>Alternative splicing of genes can increase protein diversity and affect mRNA stability. Genome-wide transcriptome sequencing has demonstrated that alternative splicing occurs in a large number of intron-containing genes of different species. However, despite the phenomenon having been known for decades, it is largely unknown how the alternatively spliced transcripts function differently. Here, we report that two alternatively spliced transcripts of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) LAMMER kinase gene <i>OsDR11</i>, long <i>OsDR11L</i> and short <i>OsDR11S</i>, play opposite roles in rice resistance against <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>), which causes the most damaging bacterial disease in rice worldwide. Overexpressing <i>OsDR11S</i> or suppressing <i>OsDR11L</i> in rice enhanced resistance to <i>Xoo</i>, which was accompanied by an accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes. In contrast, suppressing <i>OsDR11S</i> was associated with increased susceptibility to <i>Xoo</i>, along with decreased levels of JA and expression of JA signaling genes. The OsDR11S and OsDR11L proteins colocalized in the nucleus. OsDR11L showed autophosphorylation activity in vitro, while OsDR11S did not. In the presence of OsDR11S, autophosphorylation of OsDR11L was inhibited, and overexpression of <i>OsDR11S</i> suppressed <i>OsDR11L</i> expression. <i>OsDR11</i> appeared to contribute to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> quantitative trait locus against <i>Xoo</i>. These results suggest that OsDR11L is a negative regulator in rice disease resistance, which may be associated with suppression of JA signaling. The results also suggest that OsDR11S may inhibit the function of OsDR11L at both the transcription and protein kinase activity levels, leading to resistance against <i>Xoo</i>.</p>

Hydrocarbons Are Essential for Optimal Cell Size, Division, and Growth of Cyanobacteria
<p>Cyanobacteria are intricately organized, incorporating an array of internal thylakoid membranes, the site of photosynthesis, into cells no larger than other bacteria. They also synthesize C15-C19 alkanes and alkenes, which results in substantial production of hydrocarbons in the environment. All sequenced cyanobacteria encode hydrocarbon biosynthesis pathways, suggesting an important, undefined physiological role for these compounds. Here, we demonstrate that hydrocarbon-deficient mutants of <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 and <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 exhibit significant phenotypic differences from wild type, including enlarged cell size, reduced growth, and increased division defects. Photosynthetic rates were similar between strains, although a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> reduction in energy transfer between the soluble light harvesting phycobilisome complex and membrane-bound photosystems was observed. Hydrocarbons were shown to accumulate in thylakoid and cytoplasmic membranes. Modeling of membranes suggests these compounds aggregate in the center of the lipid bilayer, potentially promoting membrane flexibility and facilitating curvature. In vivo measurements confirmed that <i>Synechococcus</i> sp. PCC 7002 mutants lacking hydrocarbons exhibit reduced thylakoid membrane curvature compared to wild type. We propose that hydrocarbons may have a role in inducing the flexibility in membranes required for optimal cell division, size, and growth, and efficient association of soluble and membrane bound proteins. The recent identification of C15-C17 alkanes and alkenes in microalgal species suggests hydrocarbons may serve a similar function in a broad range of photosynthetic organisms.</p>

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem hydraulic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore hydraulic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some hydraulic techniques are prone to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">artifact</span></strong>s in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage loss of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its hydraulic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Evolutionary History of the Nesophontidae, the Last Unplaced Recent Mammal Family
<p>The mammalian evolutionary tree has lost several major clades through recent human-caused extinctions. This process of historical biodiversity loss has particularly affected tropical island regions such as the Caribbean, an area of great evolutionary diversification but poor molecular preservation. The most enigmatic of the recently extinct endemic Caribbean mammals are the Nesophontidae, a family of morphologically plesiomorphic lipotyphlan insectivores with no consensus on their evolutionary affinities, and which constitute the only major recent mammal clade to lack any molecular information on their phylogenetic placement. Here, we use a palaeogenomic approach to place Nesophontidae within the phylogeny of recent Lipotyphla. We recovered the near-complete mitochondrial genome and sequences for 17 nuclear genes from a ∼750-year-old Hispaniolan <i>Nesophontes</i> specimen, and identify a divergence from their closest living relatives, the Solenodontidae, more than 40 million years ago. Nesophontidae is thus an older distinct lineage than many extant mammalian orders, highlighting not only the role of island systems as “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">museum</span></strong>s” of diversity that preserve ancient lineages, but also the major human-caused loss of evolutionary history.</p>

Differential effects of vitamins E and C and carotenoids on growth, resistance to oxidative stress, fledging success and plumage colouration in wild great tits
<p>Oxidative stress is the imbalance between the production of reactive species and antioxidants, which causes damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Antioxidants, like vitamins and carotenoids, can limit oxidative damage and can therefore regulate the trade-off between growth, which is a period of high reactive species production, and self-maintenance. However, the role of carotenoids as antioxidants <i>in vivo</i> has been debated, and it has been suggested that carotenoid-based signals indicate the availability of non-pigmentary antioxidants (e.g. vitamins) that protect carotenoids from oxidation, known as the ‘protection hypothesis’. To evaluate the importance of vitamins versus carotenoids as antioxidants during growth and to test the protection hypothesis, we supplemented nestling great tits, <i>Parus major</i>, 3, 5 and 7 days after hatching with a single dose of carotenoids and/or vitamins in a 2×2 full-factorial design. We subsequently measured body condition, antioxidant capacity, oxidative damage, fledging success and plumage reflectance. Vitamins enhanced antioxidant capacity, but did not affect oxidative damage. Vitamin-treated nestlings had higher growth rates and higher probability of fledging. In contrast, carotenoids did not affect any of these traits. Furthermore, carotenoid-based colouration increased over the breeding season in nestlings that received vitamins only. This study shows that vitamins are limiting for growth rate and fledging success, and suggests that vitamins could regulate the trade-off between growth and self-maintenance in favour of the former. Moreover, our results are consistent with the idea that carotenoids are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> antioxidants in birds, but they do not support the protection hypothesis.</p>

The effect of two different orthoses on pain, hand function, patient satisfaction and preference in patients with thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to compare the Push Ortho Thumb Brace   CMC and a custom-made orthosis in the treatment of patients with   primary osteoarthritis of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb.   Our outcome measures were pain scores, tests of hand function, patient   satisfaction and patient preference.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A multicentre crossover randomised controlled trial was conducted   which included 63 patients (44 women) with primary osteoarthritis   of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb. Of these, 59 patients   with a mean age of 60.1 years (standard deviation 8.2), completed   the study. Patients used both orthoses for two weeks with a two-week washout   period in-between. Pain was measured on a 10-cm visual analogue   scale. Hand function was assessed using the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function   test, Nine Hole Peg Test, key grip, pinch grip and Functional Index   for Hand Osteoarthritis. Patient preference was assessed using the   Dutch version of the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with   Assistive Technology score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both orthoses resulted in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> reduction in pain scores without   significant difference between the two orthoses. The Push Ortho   Thumb Brace CMC interfered less with key grip (p < 0.001) and   the Nine Hole Peg Test (p < 0.001) than the custom-made orthosis.   The Push Ortho Thumb Brace CMC had a higher patient satisfaction   (p < 0.001) and most patients preferred this orthosis for future   use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>When considering an orthosis for osteoarthritis of the carpometacarpal   joint of the thumb, patients may prefer the Push Ortho Thumb Brace   CMC.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:237–44.</p></sec>

The quality of Achilles tendon repair five to eight years after percutaneous tenotomy in the treatment of clubfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim was to describe the mid-term appearances of the repair   process of the Achilles tendon after tenotomy in children with a   clubfoot treated using the Ponseti method.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 15 children (ten boys, five girls) with idiopathic   clubfoot were evaluated at a mean of 6.8 years (5.4 to 8.1) after   complete percutaneous division of the Achilles tendon. The contour   and subjective thickness of the tendon were recorded, and superficial   defects and its strength were assessed clinically. The echogenicity,   texture, thickness, peritendinous irregularities and potential for   deformation of the tendon were evaluated by ultrasonography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The appearance of the Achilles tendon was slightly abnormal,   with more thickening and less conspicuous contours than a normal   tendon. Its strength was grossly normal, with no insufficiency of   the triceps surae. Ultrasonographic findings revealed a mild fusiform   thickening in 12 children (80%). The tissue at the site of the repair   had a slightly hypoechoic, fibrillar quality with hyperechoic striation   and the anterior contour was irregular and blurred. There was a   focal narrowing within the healing tissue in two children.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This mid-term evaluation of the ability of the Achilles tendon   to repair after division suggests a combination of intrinsic and   extrinsic mechanisms. There were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong> abnormalities which did not   appear to affect function.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:139–44.</p></sec>

Efficacy and adverse effects of collagenase use in the treatment of Dupuytren’s disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy   of collagenase clostridium histolyticum compared with fasciectomy   and percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) for Dupuytren’s disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, Web of Science,   Cochrane, Teseo and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for clinical   trials and cohort or case-control studies which compared the clinical   outcomes and adverse effects of collagenase with those of fasciectomy   or PNF.</p><p>Of 1345 articles retrieved, ten were selected. They described   the outcomes of 425 patients treated with collagenase and 418 treated   by fasciectomy or PNF. Complications were assessed using inverse-variance   weighted odds ratios (ORs). Clinical efficacy was assessed by differences   between the means for movement of the joint before and after treatment.   Dose adjustment was applied in all cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Random-effects modelling showed that patients treated with collagenase   had 3.24 increased odds of adverse effects compared with those treated   by fasciectomy (OR 4.39) or PNF (OR 1.72,). The effect was lost   when only major complications were assessed. Joint movement analysis   revealed a difference between means of less than 10%, indicating   equivalent clinical efficacy in the short and medium term for collagenase   and fasciectomy. We were unable to analyse this for PNF due to a   shortage of data.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There were no significant differences in effect size between   collagenase and fasciectomy. The use of collagenase was associated   with a higher overall risk of adverse effects than both fasciectomy   and PNF.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:73–80.</p></sec>

Availability and Use of Shared Data From Cardiometabolic Clinical Trials
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Sharing of patient-level clinical trial data has been widely endorsed. Little is known about how extensively these data have been used for cardiometabolic diseases. We sought to evaluate the availability and use of shared data from cardiometabolic clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We extracted data from ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com, a large, multisponsor data-sharing platform hosting individual patient–level data from completed studies sponsored by 13 pharmaceutical companies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From January 2013 to May 2017, the platform had data from 3374 clinical trials, of which 537 (16%) evaluated cardiometabolic therapeutics (phase 1, 36%; phase 2, 17%; phase 2/3, 1%; phase 3, 42%; phase 4, 4%). They covered 74 therapies and 398 925 patients. Diabetes mellitus (60%) and hypertension (15%) were the most common study topics. Median time from study completion to data availability was 79 months. As of May 2017, ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com had received 318 submitted proposals, of which 163 had signed data-sharing agreements. Thirty of these proposals were related to cardiometabolic therapies and requested data from 79 unique studies (15% of all trials, 29% of phase 3/4 trials). Most (96%) data requesters of cardiometabolic clinical trial data were from academic centers in North America and Western Europe, and half the proposals were unfunded. Most proposals were for secondary hypothesis-generating questions, with only 1 proposed reanalysis of the original study primary hypothesis. To date, 3 peer-reviewed articles have been published after a median of 19 months (9–32 months) from the data-sharing agreement.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite availability of data from >500 cardiometabolic trials in a multisponsor data-sharing platform, only 15% of these trials and 29% of phase 3/4 trials have been accessed by investigators thus far, and a negligible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">minor</span></strong>ity of analyses have reached publication.</p></sec>

Depression Treatment and 1-Year Mortality After Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is prevalent and associated with an adverse quality of life and prognosis. Despite recommendations from some national organizations to screen for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion, it is unclear whether treatment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion in patients with AMI is associated with better outcomes. We aimed to determine whether the prognosis of patients with treated versus untreated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion differs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients’ Health Status) is an observational multicenter cohort study that enrolled 4062 patients aged ≥18 years with AMI between April 11, 2005, and December 31, 2008, from 24 US hospitals. Research coordinators administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) during the index AMI admission. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion was defined by a PHQ-9 score of ≥10. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion was categorized as treated if there was documentation of a discharge diagnosis, medication prescribed for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion, or referral for counseling, and as untreated if none of these 3 criteria was documented in the medical records despite a PHQ score ≥10. One-year mortality was compared between patients with AMI having: (1) no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion (PHQ-9<10; reference); (2) treated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion; and (3) untreated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion adjusting for demographics, AMI severity, and clinical factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall, 759 (18.7%) patients met PHQ-9 criteria for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion and 231 (30.4%) were treated.

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping of molecular genetic variation onto phenotypic trait variation. Our understanding of that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene effects with patterns of phenotypic trait co-variation. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 drug environments, we provide a detailed view of that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping from mutational pleiotropic variation to phenotypic co-variation, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> of drug resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among drug classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more drug- and class-specific pleiotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es to the main effects of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

Integrated Consensus Map of Cultivated Peanut and Wild Relatives Reveals Structures of the A and B Genomes of <i>Arachis</i> and Divergence of the Legume Genomes
<p>The complex, tetraploid genome structure of peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i>) has obstructed advances in genetics and genomics in the species. The aim of this study is to understand the genome structure of <i>Arachis</i> by developing a high-density integrated consensus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>. Three recombinant inbred line populations derived from crosses between the A genome diploid species, <i>Arachis duranensis</i> and <i>Arachis stenosperma</i>; the B genome diploid species, <i>Arachis ipaënsis</i> and <i>Arachis magna</i>; and between the AB genome tetraploids, <i>A. hypogaea</i> and an artificial amphidiploid (<i>A. ipaënsis</i> × <i>A. duranensis</i>)<sup>4×</sup>, were used to construct genetic linkage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s: 10 linkage groups (LGs) of 544 cM with 597 loci for the A genome; 10 LGs of 461 cM with 798 loci for the B genome; and 20 LGs of 1442 cM with 1469 loci for the AB genome. The resultant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s plus 13 published <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s were integrated into a consensus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> covering 2651 cM with 3693 marker loci which was anchored to 20 consensus LGs corresponding to the A and B genomes. The comparative genomics with genome sequences of <i>Cajanus cajan</i>, <i>Glycine max</i>, <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, and <i>Medicago truncatula</i> revealed that the <i>Arachis</i> genome has segmented synteny relationship to the other legumes. The comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s in legumes, integrated tetraploid consensus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s, and genome-specific diploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s will increase the genetic and genomic understanding of <i>Arachis</i> and should facilitate molecular breeding.</p>

Imaging of pure spin-valley diffusion current in WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures
<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials are promising for spintronic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>tronic applications because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong>-polarized excitations can be generated and manipulated with circularly polarized photons and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> and spin degrees of freedom are locked by strong spin-orbital interactions. In this study we demonstrate efficient generation of a pure and locked spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> diffusion current in tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>)–tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) heterostructures without any driving electric field. We imaged the propagation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> current in real time and space by pump-probe spectroscopy. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> current in the heterostructures can live for more than 20 microseconds and propagate over 20 micrometers; both the lifetime and the diffusion length can be controlled through electrostatic gating. The high-efficiency and electric-field–free generation of a locked spin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> current in TMDC heterostructures holds promise for applications in spin and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">valley</span></strong> devices.</p>

Airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy to map forest trait diversity and guide conservation
<p>Functional biogeography may bridge a gap between field-based biodiversity information and satellite-based Earth system studies, thereby supporting conservation plans to protect more species and their contributions to ecosystem functioning. We used airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy with environmental modeling to derive large-scale, multivariate forest canopy functional trait <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s of the Peruvian Andes-to-Amazon biodiversity hotspot. Seven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped canopy traits revealed functional variation in a geospatial pattern ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong>ed by geology, topography, hydrology, and climate. Clustering of canopy traits yielded a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> of forest beta functional diversity for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong>-use analysis. Up to 53% of each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped, functionally distinct forest presents an opportunity for new conservation action. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping functional diversity advances our understanding of the biosphere to conserve more biodiversity in the face of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> use and climate change.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Contribution of neural cell death to depressive phenotypes of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice
<p>Major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion disorder (MDD) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion is highly prevalent in individuals with diabetes, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ive symptoms are more severe and less responsive to anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ant therapies in these patients. The underlying mechanism is little understood. We hypothesized that the pathophysiology of comorbid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion was more complex than that proposed for MDD and that neural cell death played a role in the disease severity. To test this hypothesis, we generated streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. These mice had blood glucose levels threefold above controls and exhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ive phenotypes as judged by a battery of behavioral tests, thus confirming the comorbidity in mice. Immunohistological studies showed markedly increased TUNEL-positive cells in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the comorbid mice, indicating apoptosis. This finding was supported by increased caspase-3 and decreased Bcl-2 proteins in these brain regions. In addition, the serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level of comorbid mice was reduced compared with controls, further supporting the neurodegenerative change. Mechanistic analyses showed an increased expression of mitochondrial fission genes fission protein 1 (<i>Fis1</i>) and dynamin-related protein 1 (<i>Drp1</i>), and a decreased expression of mitochondrial fusion genes mitofusin 1 (<i>Mfn1</i>), mitofusin 2 (<i>Mfn2</i>) and optical atrophy 1 (<i>Opa1</i>). Representative assessment of the proteins Drp1 and Mfn2 mirrored the mRNA changes. The data demonstrated that neural cell death was associated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ive phenotype of comorbid mice and that a fission-dominant expression of genes and proteins mediating mitochondrial dynamics played a role in the hyperglycemia-induced cell death. The study provides new insight into the disease mechanism and could aid the development of novel therapeutics aimed at providing neuroprotection by modulating mitochondrial dynamics to treat comorbid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion with diabetes.</p>

Cell structural changes in the mesophyll of Norway spruce needles by elevated ozone and elevated temperature in open-field exposure during cold acclimation
<p>The effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated ozone (1.4× ambient) and temperature (ambient +1.3 °C) alone and in combination were studied on the needle cell structure of soil-grown Norway spruce seedlings in the late growing season and winter. Temperature treatment continued over winter and lengthened the snow-free period. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated temperature caused microscopic changes related to photosynthesis (decreased chloroplast size and increased number), carbon storage (reduced starch and increased cytoplasmic lipids) and defence (decreased mitochondrial size and proportion per cytoplasm, increased peroxisomes and plastoglobuli, altered appearance of tannins). The results suggest increased oxidative stress by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated temperature and altered allocation of limited carbon reserve to defence. The number of peroxisomes and plastoglobuli remained high in the outer cells of needles of ozone-exposed seedlings but decreased in the inner cells. This may indicate defence allocation to cells close to the stomata and surface, which are experiencing more oxidative stress. Ozone reduced winter hardiness based on seasonal changes in chloroplast shape and location in the cells. The effects of ozone became evident at the end of the growing season, indicating the effect of cumulative ozone dose or that the seedlings were vulnerable to ozone at the later phases of winter hardening. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated temperature increased cellular damage in early winter and visible damage in spring, and the damage was enhanced by ozone. In conclusion, the study suggests that modest air temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation increases stress at the cell structural level in spruce seedlings and is enhanced by low ozone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation. Future climatic conditions where snow cover is formed later or is lacking but temperatures are low can increase the risk of severe seedling damage, and current and future predicted ozone concentrations increase this risk.</p>

Neuropathic pain promotes adaptive changes in gene expression in brain networks involved in stress and depression
<p>Neuropathic pain is a complex chronic condition characterized by various sensory, cognitive, and affective symptoms. A large percentage of patients with neuropathic pain are also afflicted with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion and anxiety disorders, a pattern that is also seen in animal models. Furthermore, clinical and preclinical studies indicate that chronic pain corresponds with adaptations in several brain networks involved in mood, motivation, and reward. Chronic stress is also a major risk factor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion. We investigated whether chronic pain and stress affect similar molecular mechanisms and whether chronic pain can affect gene expression patterns that are involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion. Using two mouse models of neuropathic pain and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion [spared nerve injury (SNI) and chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)], we performed next-generation RNA sequencing and pathway analysis to monitor changes in gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). In addition to finding unique transcriptome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es across these regions, we identified a substantial number of signaling pathway–associated genes with similar changes in expression in both SNI and CUS mice. Many of these genes have been implicated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion, anxiety, and chronic pain in patients. Our study provides a resource of the changes in gene expression induced by long-term neuropathic pain in three distinct brain regions and reveals molecular connections between pain and chronic stress.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low concentrations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated heme-protein concentrations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated COHb concentrations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated hemoglobin and myoglobin concentrations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin concentration. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total hemoglobin concentration. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated concentrations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Genome-Wide Development and Use of Microsatellite Markers for Large-Scale Genotyping Applications in Foxtail Millet [<i>Setaria italica</i> (L.)]
<p>The availability of well-validated informative co-dominant microsatellite markers and saturated genetic linkage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> has been limited in foxtail millet (<i>Setaria italica</i> L.). In view of this, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and identified 28 342 microsatellite repeat-motifs spanning 405.3 Mb of foxtail millet genome. The trinucleotide repeats (∼48%) was prevalent when compared with dinucleotide repeats (∼46%). Of the 28 342 microsatellites, 21 294 (∼75%) primer pairs were successfully designed, and a total of 15 573 markers were physically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped on 9 chromosomes of foxtail millet. About 159 markers were validated successfully in 8 accessions of <i>Setaria</i> sp. with ∼67% polymorphic potential. The high percentage (89.3%) of cross-genera transferability across millet and non-millet species with higher transferability percentage in bioenergy grasses (∼79%, Switchgrass and ∼93%, Pearl millet) signifies their importance in studying the bioenergy grasses. <i>In silico</i> comparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping of 15 573 foxtail millet microsatellite markers against the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping data of sorghum (16.9%), maize (14.5%) and rice (6.4%) indicated syntenic relationships among the chromosomes of foxtail millet and target species.

Comparative Prognostic Utility of Indexes of Microvascular Function Alone or in Combination in Patients With an Acute ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention is frequently successful at restoring coronary artery blood flow in patients with acute ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction; however, failed myocardial reperfusion commonly passes undetected in up to half of these patients.

The median IMR and CFR were 25 (interquartile range, 15–48) and 1.6 (interquartile range, 1.1–2.1), respectively.

Do antidepressants restore lost synapses?
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion is a mental illness characterized by episodes of a sad, despondent mood and/or a loss of interest or pleasure (<i>1</i>). This pathology affects nearly 20% of the population in the United States (<i>2</i>), and treatments are limited. Indeed, in the 5 years following remission, 80% of patients will endure relapse and more than 30% of patients suffer from treatment-resistant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the clinical use of esketamine nasal spray for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion that is resistant to other treatments (<i>3</i>). Esketamine is an enantiomer of ketamine, a drug with anti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ant properties, although its mechanism of action remains unclear. Brain imaging studies suggest that neuronal circuitry in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in the physiopathology of this disorder (<i>4</i>). On page 147 of this issue, Moda-Sava <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report that ketamine induces plasticity of dendritic spines on mPFC neurons and restores microcircuit activity and behavior in animal models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion. This may expand therapeutic strategies for treating major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion.</p>

Classifying drivers of global forest loss
<p>Global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>s of forest loss depict the scale and magnitude of forest disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent conversion (i.e., deforestation) from temporary loss from forestry or wildfire.

Our results indicate that 27% of global forest loss can be attributed to deforestation through permanent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to forestry (26%), shifting agriculture (24%), and wildfire (23%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven deforestation has not declined. To end deforestation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of conversion from supply chains each year.</p>

Auxin Function in the Brown Alga <i>Dictyota dichotoma</i>
<p>Auxin controls body plan patterning in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants and has been proposed to play a similar role in the development of brown algae (Phaeophyta) despite their distant evolutionary relationship with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. The mechanism of auxin action in brown algae remains controversial because of contradicting conclusions derived from pharmacological studies on <i>Fucus</i>. In this study, we used <i>Dictyota</i> <i>dichotoma</i> as a model system to show that auxin plays a role during the apical-basal patterning of the embryo of brown algae. Indole-3-acetic acid was detectable in <i>D. dichotoma</i> germlings and mature tissue. Although two-celled <i>D. dichotoma</i> zygotes normally develop a rhizoid from one pole and a thallus meristem from the other, addition of exogenous auxins to one-celled embryos affected polarization, and both poles of the spheroidal embryo developed into rhizoids instead. The effect was strongest at lower pH and when variable extrinsic informational cues were applied. 2-[4-(diethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoyl]benzoic acid, an inhibitor of the ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein subfamily of transporters in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants, affected rhizoid formation by increasing rhizoid branching and inducing ectopic rhizoids. An in silico survey of auxin genes suggested that a diverse range of biosynthesis genes and transport genes, such as PIN-LIKES, and the ATP-binding cassette subfamily (ABC-B/multidrug resistance/P-glycoprotein) transporters from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants have homologs in <i>D. dichotoma</i> and <i>Ectocarpus siliculosus</i>. Together with reports on auxin function in basal lineages of green algae, these results suggest that auxin function predates the divergence between the green and brown lineage and the transition toward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants.</p>

GS<sup>yellow</sup>, a Multifaceted Tag for Functional Protein Analysis in Monocot and Dicot Plants
<p>The ability to tag proteins has boosted the emergence of generic molecular methods for protein functional analysis. Fluorescent protein tags are used to visualize protein localization, and affinity tags enable the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping of molecular interactions by, for example, tandem affinity purification or chromatin immunoprecipitation. To apply these widely used molecular techniques on a single transgenic plant line, we developed a multifunctional tandem affinity purification tag, named GS<sup>yellow</sup>, which combines the streptavidin-binding peptide tag with citrine yellow fluorescent protein. We demonstrated the versatility of the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag in the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) using a set of benchmark proteins. For proof of concept in monocots, we assessed the localization and dynamic interaction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>e of the leaf growth regulator ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3), fused to the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag, along the growth zone of the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) leaf. To further explore the function of ZmAN3, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped its DNA-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong>scap</span></strong>e in the growth zone of the maize leaf through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. Comparison with AN3 target genes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped in the developing maize tassel or in Arabidopsis cell cultures revealed strong conservation of AN3 target genes between different maize tissues and across monocots and dicots, respectively. In conclusion, the GS<sup>yellow</sup> tag offers a powerful molecular tool for distinct types of protein functional analyses in dicots and monocots. As this approach involves transforming a single construct, it is likely to accelerate both basic and translational plant research.</p>

Primitive Auxin Response without TIR1 and Aux/IAA in the Charophyte Alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i>
<p>The phytohormone auxin regulates many aspects of growth and development in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants, but the origin and evolution of auxin signaling and response mechanisms remain largely unknown. Indeed, it remains to be investigated whether auxin-related pathways diverged before the emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. To address this know<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ledg</span></strong>e deficit, we analyzed auxin responses in the charophyte alga <i>Klebsormidium nitens</i> NIES-2285, whose ancestor diverged from a green algal ancestor during the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. This strain is the same as <i>Klebsormidium flaccidum</i> NIES-2285, for which the draft genome was sequenced in 2014, and was taxonomically reclassified as <i>K. nitens</i>. This genome sequence revealed genes involved in auxin responses. Furthermore, the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was detected in cultures of <i>K. nitens</i>, but <i>K. nitens</i> lacks the central regulators of the canonical auxin-signaling pathway found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. Exogenous IAA inhibited cell division and cell elongation in <i>K. nitens</i>. Inhibitors of auxin biosynthesis and of polar auxin transport also inhibited cell division and elongation. Moreover, exogenous IAA rapidly induced expression of a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN transcription factor. These results suggest that <i>K. nitens</i> has acquired the part of the auxin system that regulates transcription and cell growth without the requirement for the central players that govern auxin signaling in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants.</p>

An analysis of the best method for evaluating anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip replacement on plain radiographs
<p>Several radiological methods of measuring anteversion   of the acetabular component after total hip replacement (THR) have   been described. These studies used different definitions and reference   planes to compare methods, allowing for misinterpretation of the   results. We compared the reliability and accuracy of five current   methods using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs (those of Lewinnek, Widmer, Liaw,   Pradhan, and Woo and Morrey) with CT measurements, using the same   definition and reference plane. We retrospectively studied the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong>   radiographs and CT scans in 84 hips of 84 patients who underwent   primary THR. Intra- and inter-observer reliability were high for   the measurement of inclination and anteversion with all methods   on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs and CT scans. The measurements of inclination on   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs were similar to the measurements using CT (p =   0.043). The mean difference between CT measurements was 0.6° (-5.9°   to 6.8°).</p><p>Measurements using Widmer’s method were the most similar to those   using CT (p = 0.088), with a mean difference between CT measurements   of -0.9° (-10.4° to 9.1°), whereas the other four methods differed   significantly from those using CT (p < 0.001).</p><p>This study has shown that Widmer’s method is the best for evaluating   the anteversion of the acetabular component on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> radiographs.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:597–603.</p>

Dynamic Edematous Response of the Human Heart to Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical protocols aimed to characterize the post–myocardial infarction (MI) heart by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) need to be standardized to take account of dynamic biological phenomena evolving early after the index ischemic event. Here, we evaluated the time course of edema reaction in patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation MI by CMR and assessed its implications for myocardium-at-risk (MaR) quantification both in patients and in a large-animal model.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 16 patients with anterior ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation MI successfully treated by primary angioplasty and 16 matched controls were prospectively recruited. In total, 94 clinical CMR examinations were performed: patients with ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation MI were serially scanned (within the first 3 hours after reperfusion and at 1, 4, 7, and 40 days), and controls were scanned only once. T2 relaxation time in the myocardium (T2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping) and the extent of edema on T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (ie, CMR-MaR) were evaluated at all time points. In the experimental study, 20 pigs underwent 40-minute ischemia/reperfusion followed by serial CMR examinations at 120 minutes and 1, 4, and 7 days after reperfusion. Reference MaR was assessed by contrast-multidetector computed tomography during the index coronary occlusion. Generalized linear mixed models were used to take account of repeated measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In humans, T2 relaxation time in the ischemic myocardium declines significantly from early after reperfusion to 24 hours, and then increases up to day 4, reaching a plateau from which it decreases from day 7. Consequently, edema extent measured by T2-weighted short-tau triple inversion-recovery (CMR-MaR) varied with the timing of the CMR examination. These findings were confirmed in the experimental model by showing that only CMR-MaR values for day 4 and day 7 postreperfusion, coinciding with the deferred edema wave, were similar to values measured by reference contrast-multidetector computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Post-MI edema in patients follows a bimodal pattern that affects CMR estimates of MaR. Dynamic changes in post–ST-segment–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation MI edema highlight the need for standardization of CMR timing to retrospectively delineate MaR and quantify myocardial salvage. According to the present clinical and experimental data, a time window between days 4 and 7 post-MI seems a good compromise solution for standardization. Further studies are needed to study the effect of other factors on these variables.</p></sec>

The prespecified primary efficacy outcome was cardiovascular mortality within 30 days, and the primary safety outcome was stroke or transient ischemic attack within 30 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The 3 eligible randomized trials (TAPAS [Thrombus Aspiration During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Acute Myocardial Infarction], TASTE [Thrombus Aspiration in ST-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation Myocardial Infarction in Scandinavia], and TOTAL [Trial of Routine Aspiration Thrombectomy With PCI Versus PCI Alone in Patients With STEMI]) enrolled 19 047 patients, of whom 18 306 underwent PCI and were included in the primary analysis. Cardiovascular death at 30 days occurred in 221 of 9155 patients (2.4%) randomized to thrombus aspiration and 262 of 9151 (2.9%) randomized to PCI alone (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.06).

Intonational speech prosody encoding in the human auditory cortex

We used high-density electrocorticography to record neural population activity directly from the brain surface while participants listened to sentences that varied in intonational pitch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contour</span></strong>, phonetic content, and speaker. Cortical activity at single electrodes over the human superior temporal gyrus selectively represented intonation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contour</span></strong>s. These electrodes were intermixed with, yet functionally distinct from, sites that encoded different information about phonetic features or speaker identity. Furthermore, the representation of intonation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contour</span></strong>s directly reflected the encoding of speaker-normalized relative pitch but not absolute pitch.</p>

A Novel N-Methyltransferase in Arabidopsis Appears to Feed a Conserved Pathway for Nicotinate Detoxification among Land Plants and Is Associated with Lignin Biosynthesis
<p>The Preiss-Handler pathway, which salvages nicotinate (NA) for NAD synthesis, is an indispensable biochemical pathway in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. Various NA conjugations (mainly methylation and glycosylation) have been detected and have long been proposed for NA detoxification in plants. Previously, we demonstrated that NA <i>O</i>-glucosylation functions as a mobilizable storage form for NAD biosynthesis in the Brassicaceae. However, little is known about the functions of other NA conjugations in plants. In this study, we first found that <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate is a ubiquitous NA conjugation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. Furthermore, we functionally identified a novel methyltransferase (At3g53140; NA<i>N</i>MT), which is mainly responsible for <i>N</i>-methylnicotinate formation, from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We also established that trigonelline is a detoxification form of endogenous NA in plants. Combined phylogenetic analysis and enzymatic assays revealed that NA <i>N</i>-methylation activity was likely derived from the duplication and subfunctionalization of an ancestral caffeic acid <i>O</i>-methyltransferase (<i>COMT</i>) gene in the course of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant evolution. COMT enzymes, which function in <i>S</i>-lignin biosynthesis, also have weak NA<i>N</i>MT activity. Our data suggest that NA detoxification conferred by NA<i>N</i>MT and COMT might have facilitated the retention of the Preiss-Handler pathway in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants.</p>

Origins and Evolution of Stomatal Development
<p>The fossil record suggests stomata-like pores were present on the surfaces of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants over 400 million years ago. Whether stomata arose once or whether they arose independently across newly evolving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant lineages has long been a matter of debate. In Arabidopsis, a genetic toolbox has been identified that tightly controls stomatal development and patterning. This includes the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors <i>SPEECHLESS</i> (<i>SPCH</i>), <i>MUTE</i>, <i>FAMA</i>, and <i>ICE/SCREAMs</i> (<i>SCRMs</i>), which promote stomatal formation. These factors are regulated via a signaling cascade, which includes mobile <i>EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR</i> (<i>EPF</i>) peptides to enforce stomatal spacing. Mosses and hornworts, the most ancient extant lineages to possess stomata, possess orthologs of these Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) stomatal toolbox genes, and manipulation in the model bryophyte <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> has shown that the bHLH and EPF components are also required for moss stomatal development and patterning. This supports an ancient and tightly conserved genetic origin of stomata. Here, we review recent discoveries and, by interrogating newly available plant genomes, we advance the story of stomatal development and patterning across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant evolution. Furthermore, we identify potential orthologs of the key toolbox genes in a hornwort, further supporting a single ancient genetic origin of stomata in the ancestor to all stomatous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, diffuse light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown leaves from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under diffuse compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level diffuse light photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) leaves underlies its previously observed diffuse light photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es, we found that weaker penetration of diffuse versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower leaves led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under diffuse light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown leaves, primarily because thin shade-grown leaves similarly distribute diffuse and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how diffuse light photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">depress</span></strong>ion could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

0/1-Hour Triage Algorithm for Myocardial Infarction in Patients With Renal Dysfunction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The European Society of Cardiology recommends a 0/1-hour algorithm for rapid rule-out and rule-in of non–ST-segment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentrations irrespective of renal function. Because patients with renal dysfunction (RD) frequently present with increased hs-cTn concentrations even in the absence of non–ST-segment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction, concern has been raised regarding the performance of the 0/1-hour algorithm in RD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a prospective multicenter diagnostic study enrolling unselected patients presenting with suspected non–ST-segment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction to the emergency department, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in patients with RD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and compared it to patients with normal renal function. The final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists using all available information, including cardiac imaging. Safety was quantified as sensitivity in the rule-out zone, accuracy as the specificity in the rule-in zone, and efficacy as the proportion of the overall cohort assigned to either rule-out or rule-in based on the 0- and 1-hour sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 3254 patients, RD was present in 487 patients (15%). The prevalence of non–ST-segment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation myocardial infarction was substantially higher in patients with RD compared with patients with normal renal function (31% versus 13%, <i>P</i><0.001). Using hs-cTnT, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (100.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 97.6–100.0] versus 99.2% [95% CI, 97.6–99.8]; <i>P</i>=0.559), lower specificity of rule-in (88.7% [95% CI, 84.8–91.9] versus 96.5% [95% CI, 95.7–97.2]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (51% versus 81%, <i>P</i><0.001), mainly driven by a much lower percentage of patients eligible for rule-out (18% versus 68%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function. Using hs-cTnI, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (98.6% [95% CI, 95.0–99.8] versus 98.5% [95% CI, 96.5–99.5]; <i>P</i>=1.0), lower specificity of rule-in (84.4% [95% CI, 79.9–88.3] versus 91.7% [95% CI, 90.5–92.9]; <i>P</i><0.001), and lower overall efficacy (54% versus 76%, <i>P</i><0.001; proportion ruled out, 18% versus 58%, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with RD, the safety of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm is high, but specificity of rule-in and overall efficacy are decreased. Modifications of the rule-in and rule-out thresholds did not improve the safety or overall efficacy of the 0/1-hour algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Upregulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K Is Linked to Immunity and Inflammation in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Immune dysregulation has been linked to occlusive vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is hereditary, idiopathic, or associated with other conditions. Circulating autoantibodies, lung perivascular lymphoid tissue, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated cytokines have been related to PAH pathogenesis but without a clear understanding of how these abnormalities are initiated, perpetuated, and connected in the progression of disease. We therefore set out to identify specific target antigens in PAH lung immune complexes as a starting point toward resolving these issues to better inform future application of immunomodulatory therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lung immune complexes were isolated and PAH target antigens were identified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and localized by confocal microscopy. One PAH antigen linked to immunity and inflammation was pursued and a link to PAH pathophysiology was investigated by next-generation sequencing, functional studies in cultured monocytes and endothelial cells, and hemodynamic and lung studies in a rat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), an innate immune factor that suppresses HIV replication, was identified and confirmed as highly expressed in immune complexes from 16 hereditary and idiopathic PAH versus 12 control lungs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated SAMHD1 was localized to endothelial cells, perivascular dendritic cells, and macrophages, and SAMHD1 antibodies were prevalent in tertiary lymphoid tissue. An unbiased screen using metagenomic sequencing related SAMHD1 to increased expression of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in PAH versus control lungs (n=4). HERV-K envelope and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase mRNAs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated in PAH versus control lungs (n=10), and proteins were localized to macrophages. HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced SAMHD1 and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 6, interleukin 1β, and tumor necrosis factor α) in circulating monocytes, pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, and also activated B cells. Vulnerability of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAEC) to apoptosis was increased by HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase in an interleukin 6-independent manner. Furthermore, 3 weekly injections of HERV-K deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase induced hemodynamic and vascular changes of pulmonary hypertension in rats (n=8) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated interleukin 6.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study reveals that upregulation of the endogenous retrovirus HERV-K could both initiate and sustain activation of the immune system and cause vascular changes associated with PAH.</p></sec>

Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Lowering for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Among Men With Primary Elevations of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels of 190 mg/dL or Above
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥190 mg/dL are at a higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as a result of long-term exposure to markedly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated LDL-C levels. Therefore, initiation of statin therapy is recommended for these individuals. However, there is a lack of randomized trial evidence supporting these recommendations in primary prevention. In the present analysis, we provide hitherto unpublished data on the cardiovascular effects of LDL-C lowering among a primary prevention population with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We aimed to assess the benefits of LDL-C lowering on cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ations of LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL without preexisting vascular disease at baseline.

WOSCOPS enrolled 6595 men aged 45 to 64 years, who were randomly assigned to pravastatin 40 mg/d or placebo. In the present analyses, 5529 participants without evidence of vascular disease were included, stratified by LDL-C levels into those with LDL-C <190 mg/dL (n=2969; mean LDL-C 178±6 mg/dL) and those with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (n=2560; mean LDL-C 206±12 mg/dL).

Early Use of N-acetylcysteine With Nitrate Therapy in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for ST-Segment–Elevation Myocardial Infarction Reduces Myocardial Infarct Size (the NACIAM Trial [N-acetylcysteine in Acute Myocardial Infarction])

Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> by early nonvascular plants. Resurrection plants have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection plant lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection plant genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection plants convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection plants and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection plants. Together, these observations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants through tandem gene duplication.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong>s its faster growth rate.</p>

Recursive Paleohexaploidization Shaped the Durian Genome
<p>The durian (<i>Durio zibethinus</i>) genome has recently become available, and analysis of this genome reveals two paleopolyploidization events previously inferred as shared with cotton (<i>Gossypium</i> spp.). Here, we reanalyzed the durian genome in comparison with other well-characterized genomes. We found that durian and cotton were actually affected by different polyploidization events: hexaploidization in durian ∼19–21 million years ago (mya) and decaploidization in cotton ∼13–14 mya. Previous interpretations of shared polyploidization events may have resulted from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated evolutionary rates in cotton genes due to the decaploidization and insufficient consideration of the complexity of plant genomes. The decaploidization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated evolutionary rates of cotton genes by ∼64% compared to durian and ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong>ed a previous ∼4-fold over dating of the event. In contrast, the hexaploidization in durian did not prominently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ate gene evolutionary rates, likely due to its long generation time. Moreover, divergent evolutionary rates probably ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong> 98.4% of reconstructed phylogenetic trees of homologous genes being incongruent with expected topology. The findings provide further insight into the roles played by polypoidization in the evolution of genomes and genes, and they suggest revisiting existing reconstructed phylogenetic trees.</p>

MKK6 Functions in Two Parallel MAP Kinase Cascades in Immune Signaling
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MAP KINASE (MPK) proteins can function in multiple MAP kinase cascades and physiological processes. For instance, MPK4 functions in regulating development as well as in plant defense by participating in two independent MAP kinase cascades: the MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 cascade promotes basal resistance against pathogens and is guarded by the NB-LRR protein SUMM2, whereas the ANPs-MKK6-MPK4 cascade plays an essential role in cytokinesis. Here, we report a novel role for MKK6 in regulating plant immune responses. We found that MKK6 functions similarly to MKK1/MKK2 and works together with MEKK1 and MPK4 to prevent autoactivation of SUMM2-mediated defense responses. Interestingly, loss of MKK6 or ANP2/ANP3 results in constitutive activation of plant defense responses. The autoimmune phenotypes of <i>mkk6</i> and <i>anp2 anp3</i> mutant plants can be largely suppressed by a constitutively active <i>mpk4</i> mutant. Further analysis showed that the constitutive defense response in <i>anp2 anp3</i> is dependent on the defense regulators PAD4 and EDS1, but not on SUMM2, suggesting that the ANP2/ANP3-MKK6-MPK4 cascade may be guarded by a TIR-NB-LRR protein. Our study shows that MKK6 has multiple functions in plant defense responses in addition to cytokinesis.</p>

Timing and Order of the Molecular Events Marking the Onset of Berry Ripening in Grapevine
<p>Grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) is a model for the investigation of physiological and biochemical changes during the formation and ripening of nonclimacteric fleshy fruits. However, the order and complexity of the molecular events during fruit development remain poorly understood. To identify the key molecular events controlling berry formation and ripening, we created a highly detailed transcriptomic and metabolomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong> of berry development, based on samples collected every week from fruit set to maturity in two grapevine genotypes for three consecutive years, resulting in 219 samples. Major transcriptomic changes were represented by coordinated waves of gene expression associated with early development, veraison (onset of ripening)/midripening, and late-ripening and were consistent across vintages. The two genotypes were clearly distinguished by metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es and transcriptional changes occurring primarily at the veraison/midripening phase. Coexpression analysis identified a core network of transcripts as well as variations in the within-module connections representing varietal differences. By focusing on transcriptome rearrangements close to veraison, we identified two rapid and successive shared transitions involving genes whose expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es precisely locate the timing of the molecular reprogramming of berry development. Functional analyses of two transcription factors, markers of the first transition, suggested that they participate in a hierarchical cascade of gene activation at the onset of ripening. This study defined the initial transcriptional events that mark and trigger the onset of ripening and the molecular network that characterizes the whole process of berry development, providing a framework to model fruit development and maturation in grapevine.</p>

The Major Origin of Seedless Grapes Is Associated with a Missense Mutation in the MADS-Box Gene <i>VviAGL11</i>
<p>Seedlessness is greatly prized by consumers of fresh grapes. While stenospermocarpic seed abortion determined by the <i>SEED DEVELOPMENT INHIBITOR</i> (<i>SDI</i>) locus is the usual source of seedlessness in commercial grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) cultivars, the underlying <i>sdi</i> mutation remains unknown. Here, we undertook an integrative approach to identify the causal mutation. Quantitative genetics and fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping in two ‘Crimson Seedless’-derived F1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping populations confirmed the major effect of the <i>SDI</i> locus and delimited the <i>sdi</i> mutation to a 323-kb region on chromosome 18. RNA-sequencing comparing seed traces of seedless and seeds of seeded F1 individuals identified processes triggered during <i>sdi</i>-determined seed abortion, including the activation of salicylic acid-dependent autoimmunity. The RNA-sequencing data set was investigated for candidate genes, and while no evidence for causal cis-acting regulatory mutations was detected, deleterious nucleotide changes in coding sequences of the seedless haplotype were predicted in two genes within the <i>sdi</i> fine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping interval. Targeted resequencing of the two genes in a collection of 124 grapevine cultivars showed that only the point variation causing the arginine-197-to-leucine substitution in the seed morphogenesis regulator gene <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE11</i> (<i>VviAGL11</i>) was fully linked with stenospermocarpy. The concurrent postzygotic variation identified for this missense polymorphism and seedlessness phenotype in seeded somatic variants of the original stenospermocarpic cultivar supports a causal effect. We postulate that seed abortion caused by this amino acid substitution in VviAGL11 is the major cause of seedlessness in cultivated grapevine. This information can be exploited to boost seedless grape breeding.</p>

Trehalose 6-Phosphate Regulates Photosynthesis and Assimilate Partitioning in Reproductive Tissue<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Transgenic maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) that expresses rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE PHOSPHATASE1</i> (<i>TPP1</i>) from the rice <i>MADS6</i> promoter, which is active over the flowering period, produces higher yields than wild type. This yield increase occurs with or without drought conditions during flowering. To understand the mechanistic basis of the increased yield, we characterized gene expression and metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es in leaves and developing female reproductive tissue, comprising florets, node, pith, and shank, over the flowering period with and without drought. The <i>MADS6</i> promoter was most active in the vasculature, particularly phloem companion cells in florets and pith, consistent with the largest decreases in trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) levels (2- to 3-fold) being found in pith and florets. Low T6P led to decreased gene expression for primary metabolism and increased gene expression for secondary metabolism, particularly lipid-related pathways. Despite similar changes in gene expression, the pith and floret displayed opposing assimilate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es: sugars, sugar phosphates, amino acids, and lipids increased in florets, but decreased in pith. Possibly ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong>ing this assimilate distribution, seven <i>SWEET</i> genes were found to be up-regulated in the transgenic plants. SnRK1 activity and the expression of the gene for the SnRK1 beta subunit, expression of SnRK1 marker genes, and endogenous trehalose pathway genes were also altered. Furthermore, leaves of the transgenic maize maintained a higher photosynthetic rate for a longer period compared to wild type. In conclusion, we found that decreasing T6P in reproductive tissues down-regulates primary metabolism and up-regulates secondary metabolism, resulting in different metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es in component tissues. Our data implicate T6P/ SnRK1 as a major regulator of whole-plant resource allocation for crop yield improvement.</p>

A Poly(A) Ribonuclease Controls the Cellotriose-Based Interaction between <i>Piriformospora indica</i> and Its Host Arabidopsis
<p><i>Piriformospora indica</i>, an endophytic root-colonizing fungus, efficiently promotes plant growth and induces resistance to abiotic stress and biotic diseases. <i>P. indica</i> fungal cell wall extract induces cytoplasmic calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation in host plant roots. Here, we show that cellotriose (CT) is an elicitor-active cell wall moiety released by <i>P. indica</i> into the medium. CT induces a mild defense-like response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, changes in membrane potential, and the expression of genes involved in growth regulation and root development. CT-based cytoplasmic calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) roots does not require the BAK1 coreceptor or the putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels TPC1, GLR3.3, GLR2.4, and GLR2.5 and operates synergistically with the elicitor chitin. We identified an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant (<i>cytoplasmic</i> <i>calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ation mutant</i>) impaired in the response to CT and various other cellooligomers (<i>n</i> = 2–7), but not to chitooligomers (<i>n</i> = 4–8), in roots. The mutant contains a single nucleotide exchange in the gene encoding a poly(A) ribonuclease (AtPARN; At1g55870) that degrades the poly(A) tails of specific mRNAs. The wild-type <i>PARN</i> cDNA, expressed under the control of a 35S promoter, complements the mutant phenotype. Our identification of cellotriose as a novel chemical mediator casts light on the complex <i>P. indica</i>-plant mutualistic relationship.</p>

Arabidopsis β-Amylase2 Is a K<sup>+</sup>-Requiring, Catalytic Tetramer with Sigmoidal Kinetics
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome contains nine β-amylase (<i>BAM</i>) genes, some of which play important roles in starch hydrolysis. However, little is known about BAM2, a plastid-localized enzyme reported to have extremely low catalytic activity. Using conservation of intron positions, we determined that the nine Arabidopsis <i>BAM</i> genes fall into two distinct subfamilies. A similar pattern was found in each major lineage of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants, suggesting that these subfamilies diverged prior to the origin of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plants. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis indicated that <i>BAM2</i> is the ancestral member of one of these subfamilies. This finding, along with the conservation of amino acids in the active site of BAM2, suggested that it might be catalytically active. We then identified KCl as necessary for BAM2 activity. Unlike BAM1, BAM3, and BAM5, three Arabidopsis BAMs that all exhibited hyperbolic kinetics, BAM2 exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of over 3. Using multi-angle light scattering, we determined that BAM2 was a tetramer, whereas BAM5 was a monomer. Conserved residues from a diverse set of BAM2 orthologs were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ped onto a homology model of the protein, revealing a large, conserved surface away from the active site that we hypothesize is a secondary carbohydrate-binding site. Introduction of bulky methionine for glycine at two points on this surface reduced catalytic activity significantly without disrupting the tetrameric structure. Expression analysis indicated that BAM2 is more closely coexpressed with other starch degradation enzymes than any other BAM, suggesting that BAM2 may play an important role in starch degradation in plants.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons absorbed by PSII. Absorption <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

Genetic Architecture and Molecular Networks Underlying Leaf Thickness in Desert-Adapted Tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i>
<p>Thicker leaves allow plants to grow in water-limited conditions. However, our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this highly functional leaf shape trait is poor. We used a custom-built confocal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>ometer to directly measure leaf thickness in a set of introgression lines (ILs) derived from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desert</span></strong> tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i> and identified quantitative trait loci. We report evidence of a complex genetic architecture of this trait and roles for both genetic and environmental factors. Several ILs with thick leaves have dramatically elongated palisade mesophyll cells and, in some cases, increased leaf ploidy. We characterized the thick IL2-5 and IL4-3 in detail and found increased mesophyll cell size and leaf ploidy levels, suggesting that endoreduplication underpins leaf thickness in tomato. Next, we queried the transcriptomes and inferred dynamic Bayesian networks of gene expression across early leaf ontogeny in these lines to compare the molecular networks that pattern leaf thickness. We show that thick ILs share <i>S. pennellii</i>-like expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es for putative regulators of cell shape and meristem determinacy as well as a general signature of cell cycle-related gene expression. However, our network data suggest that leaf thickness in these two lines is patterned at least partially by distinct mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, double homozygote lines combining introgression segments from these two ILs show additive phenotypes, including thick leaves, higher ploidy levels, and larger palisade mesophyll cells. Collectively, these data establish a framework of genetic, anatomical, and molecular mechanisms that pattern leaf thickness in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desert</span></strong>-adapted tomato.</p>

Fern Stomatal Responses to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> Depend on Species and Growth Conditions
<p>Changing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, climate, and air humidity affect plant gas exchange that is controlled by stomata, small pores on plant leaves and stems formed by guard cells. Evolution has shaped the morphology and regulatory mechanisms governing stomatal movements to correspond to the needs of various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant groups over the past 400 million years. Stomata close in response to the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and reduced air humidity. Whether the active regulatory mechanisms that control stomatal closure in response to these stimuli are present already in mosses, the oldest plant group with stomata, or were acquired more recently in angiosperms remains controversial. It has been suggested that the stomata of the basal vascular plants, such as ferns and lycophytes, close solely hydropassively. On the other hand, active stomatal closure in response to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> was found in several moss, lycophyte, and fern species. Here, we show that the stomata of two temperate fern species respond to ABA and CO<sub>2</sub> and that an active mechanism of stomatal regulation in response to reduced air humidity is present in some ferns. Importantly, fern stomatal responses depend on growth conditions. The data indicate that the stomatal behavior of ferns is more complex than anticipated before, and active stomatal regulation is present in some ferns and has possibly been lost in others. Further analysis that takes into account fern species, life history, evolutionary age, and growth conditions is required to gain insight into the evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong> plant stomatal responses.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of lipid synthesis in oil seeds is still not fully understood. Oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of lipid accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">map</span></strong>ping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major lipid species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land</span></strong>scap</span></strong>e of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different lipid compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the lipid composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed lipid accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of lipid molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct lipid distribution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es observed imply differential regulation of lipid metabolism between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oilseed rape productivity and quality.</p>

NAD Acts as an Integral Regulator of Multiple Defense Layers
<p>Pyridine nucleotides, such as NAD, are crucial redox carriers and have emerged as important signaling molecules in stress responses. Previously, we have demonstrated in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that the inducible NAD-overproducing <i>nadC</i> lines are more resistant to an avirulent strain of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> (<i>Pst-AvrRpm1</i>), which was associated with salicylic acid-dependent defense. Here, we have further characterized the NAD-dependent immune response in Arabidopsis. Quinolinate-induced stimulation of intracellular NAD in transgenic <i>nadC</i> plants enhanced resistance against a diverse range of (a)virulent pathogens, including <i>Pst-AvrRpt2</i>, <i>Dickeya dadantii</i>, and <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. Characterization of the redox status demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elev</span></strong>ated NAD levels induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the expression of redox marker genes of the cytosol and mitochondrion. Using pharmacological and reverse genetics approaches, we show that NAD-induced ROS production functions independently of NADPH oxidase activity and light metabolism but depends on mitochondrial respiration, which was increased at higher NAD. We further demonstrate that NAD primes pathogen-induced callose deposition and cell death. Mass spectrometry analysis reveals that NAD simultaneously induces different defense hormones and that the NAD-induced metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es are similar to those of defense-expressing plants after treatment with pathogen-associated molecular patterns. We thus conclude that NAD triggers metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">profil</span></strong>es rather similar to that of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and discuss how signaling cross talk between defense hormones, ROS, and NAD ex<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plain</span></strong>s the observed resistance to pathogens.</p>

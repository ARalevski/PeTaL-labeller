Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s on yield components explaining variations in bunch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of fruits per bunch and oil dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>) describing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> and the fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> per bunch. Variations in bunch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> per month were mainly due to variations in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, variations in fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated plants, the decrease in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and oil concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n at the control level, without any major decrease in the concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

Seasonal Regulation of Petal Number
<p>Four petals characterize the flowers of most species in the Brassicaceae family, and this phenotype is generally robust to genetic and environmental variation. A variable petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> distinguishes the flowers of <i>Cardamine hirsuta</i> from those of its close relative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), and allelic variation at many loci contribute to this trait. However, it is less clear whether <i>C. hirsuta</i> petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> varies in response to seasonal changes in environment. To address this question, we assessed whether petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> responds to a suite of environmental and endogenous cues that regulate flowering time in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. We found that petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> showed seasonal variation in <i>C. hirsuta</i>, such that spring flowering plants developed more petals than those flowering in summer. Conditions associated with spring flowering, including cool ambient temperature, short photoperiod, and vernalization, all increased petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> in <i>C. hirsuta</i>. Cool temperature caused the strongest increase in petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> and lengthened the time interval over which floral meristems matured. We performed live imaging of early flower development and showed that floral buds developed more slowly at 15°C versus 20°C. This extended phase of floral meristem formation, coupled with slower growth of sepals at 15°C, produced larger intersepal regions with more space available for petal initiation. In summary, the growth and matu<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n of floral buds is associated with variable petal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> in <i>C. hirsuta</i> and responds to seasonal changes in ambient temperature.</p>

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether varus or valgus   alignment indeed leads to increased medial or lateral tibiofemoral   forces during static and dynamic weight-bearing activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Tibiofemoral contact forces and moments were measured in nine   patients with instrumented knee implants. Medial force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend). Hip-knee-ankle angles in the frontal plane were analysed   using full-leg coronal radiographs. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The medial force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> strongly correlated with the tibiofemoral   alignment in the static condition of one-legged stance (R² = 0.88)   and dynamic single-limb loading (R² = 0.59) with varus malalignment   leading to increased medial force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s of up to 88%. In contrast,   the correlation between leg alignment and magnitude of medial compartment force   was much less pronounced. A lateral shift of force occurred during   activities with double-limb support and higher knee flexion angles. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The medial force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> depends on both the tibiofemoral alignment   and the nature of the activity involved. It cannot be generalised   to a single value. Higher medial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s during single-limb loading   are associated with varus malalignment in TKA. The current trend   towards a ‘constitutional varus’ after joint replacement, in terms   of overall tibiofemoral alignment, should be considered carefully   with respect to the increased medial force <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:779–87.</p></sec>

Quantifying the ‘law of diminishing returns’ in magnetically controlled growing rods
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) allow non-invasive   correction of the spinal deformity in the treatment of early-onset   scoliosis. Conventional growing rod systems (CGRS) need repeated   surgical distractions: these are associated with the effect of the   ‘law of diminishing returns’.</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to quantify this effect in   MCGRs over sequential distractions. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 35 patients with a maximum follow-up of 57 months   were included in the study. There were 17 boys and 18 girls with   a mean age of 7.4 years (2 to 14). True Distraction (TD) was determined   by measuring the expansion gap on fluoroscopy. This was compared   with Intended Distraction (ID) and expressed as the ‘T/I’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>.   The T/I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> and the Cobb angle were calculated at several time   points during follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 30 months (6 to 57). There was a significant   decrease in the mean T/I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> over time (convex rod at 3 months   0.81, <sc>sd</sc> 0.58 <i>vs</i> 51 months 0.17, <sc>sd </sc>0.16,    p = 0.0001; concave rod at 3 months 0.93, <sc>sd</sc> 0.67 <i>vs</i> 51   months 0.18, <sc>sd</sc> 0.15, p = 0.0001). A linear decline of   the mean T/I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s was noted for both convex rods (r<sup>2</sup> =   0.90, p = 0.004) and concave rods (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.81, p = 0.015)   over 51 months. At the 24-month follow-up stage, there was a significant   negative correlation between the mean T/I <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of the concave rod   with weight (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), age (r = -0.59, p = 0.01), and   BMI of the child (r = -0.54,    p = 0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ‘law of diminishing returns’ is also seen after serial distraction   using MCGR. Compared to previously published data for CGRS, there   is a gradual linear decline rather than a rapid initial decline   in lengthening.

Oral Anticoagulation in Very Elderly Patients With Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stroke prevention with oral anticoagulants (OACs) is the cornerstone for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data about the use of OACs among patients ≥90 years of age are limited. We aimed to investigate the risk of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and the net clinical benefit of OAC treatment for very elderly patients with AF (≥90 years of age).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were compared between 11 064 and 14 658 patients with and without AF ≥90 years of age without antithrombotic therapy from 1996 to 2011. Patients with AF (n=15 756) were divided into 3 groups (no treatment, antiplatelet agents, and warfarin), and the risks of stroke and ICH were analyzed. The risks of ischemic stroke and ICH were further compared between patients treated with warfarin and nonvitamin K antagonist OACs (NOACs) from 2012 to 2015 when NOACs were available in Taiwan.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Compared with patients without AF, patients with AF had an increased risk of ischemic stroke (event <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>/patient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>, incidence = 742/11 064, 5.75%/y versus 1399/14 658, 3.00%/y; hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.74–2.14) and similar risk of ICH (131/11 064, 0.97%/y versus 206/14 658, 0.54%/y; hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.09) in competing risk analysis for mortality. Among patients with AF, warfarin use was associated with a lower stroke risk (39/617, 3.83%/y versus 742/11 064, 5.75%/y; hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.49–0.96 in a competing risk model), with no difference in ICH risk compared with nontreatment. When compared with no antithrombotic therapy or antiplatelet drugs, warfarin was associated with a positive net clinical benefit. These findings persisted in propensity-matched analyses. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were associated with a lower risk of ICH (4/978, 0.42%/y versus 19/768, 1.63%/y; hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.10–0.97 in a competing risk model), with no difference in risk of ischemic stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with AF ≥90 years of age, warfarin was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke and positive net clinical benefit. Compared with warfarin, NOACs were associated with a lower risk of ICH. Thus, OACs may still be considered as thromboprophylaxis for elderly patients, with NOACs being the more favorable choice.</p></sec>

Cholesterol Efflux Capacity, High-Density Lipoprotein Particle Number, and Incident Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent failures of drugs that raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels to reduce cardiovascular events in clinical trials have led to increased interest in alternative indices of HDL quality, such as cholesterol efflux capacity, and HDL quantity, such as HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>. However, no studies have directly compared these metrics in a contemporary population that includes potent statin therapy and low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HDL cholesterol levels, apolipoprotein A-I, cholesterol efflux capacity, and HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> were assessed at baseline and 12 months in a nested case-control study of the JUPITER trial (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), a randomized primary prevention trial that compared rosuvastatin treatment to placebo in individuals with normal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but increased C-reactive protein levels. In total, 314 cases of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, arterial revascularization, stroke, or cardiovascular death) were compared to age- and gender-matched controls. Conditional logistic regression models adjusting for risk factors evaluated associations between HDL-related biomarkers and incident CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cholesterol efflux capacity was moderately correlated with HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I, and HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> (Spearman <i>r</i>= 0.39, 0.48, and 0.39 respectively; <i>P</i><0.001). Baseline HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> was inversely associated with incident CVD (adjusted odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> per SD increment [OR/SD], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56–0.86; <i>P</i><0.001), whereas no significant association was found for baseline cholesterol efflux capacity (OR/SD, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72–1.10; <i>P</i>=0.28), HDL cholesterol (OR/SD, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.66–1.02; <i>P</i>=0.08), or apolipoprotein A-I (OR/SD, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67–1.03; <i>P</i>=0.08). Twelve months of rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) did not change cholesterol efflux capacity (average percentage change −1.5%, 95% CI, −13.3 to +10.2; <i>P</i>=0.80), but increased HDL cholesterol (+7.7%), apolipoprotein A-I (+4.3%), and HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> (+5.2%). On-statin cholesterol efflux capacity was inversely associated with incident CVD (OR/SD, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42–0.92; <i>P</i>=0.02), although HDL particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> again emerged as the strongest predictor (OR/SD, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33–0.77; <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In JUPITER, cholesterol efflux capacity was associated with incident CVD in individuals on potent statin therapy but not at baseline.

Can we predict which dysplastic hips will require acetabular augmentation during total hip arthroplasty based on pre-operative radiographs?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an innovative   templating technique could predict the need for acetabular augmentation   during primary total hip arthroplasty for patients with dysplastic   hips.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We developed a simple templating technique to estimate acetabular   component coverage at total hip arthroplasty, the True Cup: False   Cup (TC:FC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>. We reviewed all patients with dysplastic hips   who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty between 2005 and 2012.   Traditional radiological methods of assessing the degree of acetabular dysplasia   (Sharp’s angle, Tönnis angle, centre-edge angle) as well as the   TC:FC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> were measured from the pre-operative radiographs. A   comparison of augmented and non-augmented hips was undertaken to   determine any difference in pre-operative radiological indices between   the two cohorts. The intra- and inter-observer reliability for all   radiological indices used in the study were also calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 128 cases reviewed, 33 (26%) needed acetabular augmentation.   We found no difference in the median Sharp’s angle (p = 0.10), Tönnis   angle (p = 0.28), or centre-edge angle (p = 0.07) between the two   groups.

Association Between Hospital Volume, Processes of Care, and Outcomes in Patients Admitted With Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Hospital volume is frequently used as a structural metric for assessing quality of care, but its utility in patients admitted with acute heart failure (HF) is not well characterized. Accordingly, we sought to determine the relationship between admission volume, process-of-care metrics, and short- and long-term outcomes in patients admitted with acute HF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients enrolled in the Get With The Guidelines-HF registry with linked Medicare inpatient data at 342 hospitals were assessed. Volume was assessed both as a continuous variable, and quartiles based on the admitting hospital annual HF case volume, as well: 5 to 38 (quartile 1), 39 to 77 (quartile 2), 78 to 122 (quartile 3), 123 to 457 (quartile 4). The main outcome measures were (1) process measures at discharge (achievement of HF achievement, quality, reporting, and composite metrics); (2) 30-day mortality and hospital readmission; and (3) 6-month mortality and hospital readmission. Adjusted logistic and Cox proportional hazards models were used to study these associations with hospital volume.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 125 595 patients with HF were included. Patients admitted to high-volume hospitals had a higher burden of comorbidities. On multivariable modeling, lower-volume hospitals were significantly less likely to be adherent to HF process measures than higher-volume hospitals. Higher hospital volume was not associated with a difference in in-hospital (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.05; <i>P</i>=0.78) or 30-day mortality (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.01; <i>P</i>=0.26), or 30-day readmissions (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.10).

Metabolic and Proliferative State of Vascular Adventitial Fibroblasts in Pulmonary Hypertension Is Regulated Through a MicroRNA-124/PTBP1 (Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1)/Pyruvate Kinase Muscle Axis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>An emerging metabolic theory of pulmonary hypertension (PH) suggests that cellular and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction underlies the pathology of this disease. We and others have previously demonstrated the existence of hyperproliferative, apoptosis-resistant, proinflammatory adventitial fibroblasts from human and bovine hypertensive pulmonary arterial walls (PH-Fibs) that exhibit constitutive reprogramming of glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, accompanied by an increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of glucose catabolism through glycolysis versus the tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, the mechanisms responsible for these metabolic alte<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>ns in PH-Fibs remain unknown. We hypothesized that in PH-Fibs microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1) expression to control alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) isoforms 1 and 2, resulting in an increased PKM2/PKM1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, which promotes glycolysis and prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n even in aerobic environments.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts were isolated from calves and humans with severe PH (PH-Fibs) and from normal subjects. PTBP1 gene knockdown was achieved via PTBP1-siRNA; resto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n of miR-124 was performed with miR-124 mimic. TEPP-46 and shikonin were used to manipulate PKM2 glycolytic function. Histone deacetylase inhibitors were used to treat cells. Metabolic products were determined by mass spectrometry–based metabolomics analyses, and mitochondrial function was analyzed by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We detected an increased PKM2/PKM1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> in PH-Fibs compared with normal subjects. PKM2 inhibition reversed the glycolytic status of PH-Fibs, decreased their cell prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n, and attenuated macrophage interleukin-1β expression. Furthermore, normalizing the PKM2/PKM1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> in PH-Fibs by miR-124 overexpression or PTBP1 knockdown reversed the glycolytic phenotype (decreased the production of glycolytic intermediates and byproducts, ie, lactate), rescued mitochondrial reprogramming, and decreased cell prolife<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n. Pharmacological manipulation of PKM2 activity with TEPP-46 and shikonin or treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors produced similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In PH, miR-124, through the alternative splicing factor PTBP1, regulates the PKM2/PKM1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, the overall metabolic, proliferative, and inflammatory state of cells. This PH phenotype can be rescued with interventions at various levels of the metabolic cascade. These findings suggest a more integrated view of vascular cell metabolism, which may open unique therapeutic prospects in targeting the dynamic glycolytic and mitochondrial interactions and between mesenchymal inflammatory cells in PH.</p></sec>

Evaluating the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Statin Use Guidelines for Primary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statins are effective in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline expands recommended statin use, but its cost-effectiveness has not been compared with other guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the ACC/AHA guideline relative to current use, Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, and universal statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age over a 10-year horizon from 2016 to 2025. Sensitivity analyses varied costs, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each approach produces substantial benefits and net cost savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 35. The ACC/AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the Adult Treatment Panel III guideline, with a marginal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45 to 74 years of age and women 55 to 74 years of age would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC/AHA guideline, with a marginal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> needed to treat for 10 years per quality-adjusted life-year gained of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than women. Results vary moderately with different risk thresholds for instituting statins and statin toxicity estimates but depend greatly on the disutility caused by daily medication use (pill burden).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>At a population level, the ACC/AHA guideline for expanded statin use for primary prevention is projected to treat more people, to save more lives, and to cost less compared with Adult Treatment Panel III in both men and women. Whether individuals benefit from long-term statin use for primary prevention depends more on the disutility associated with pill burden than their degree of cardiovascular risk.</p></sec>

Multimodality Strategy for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment among adults without known CVD are limited by suboptimal performance and a narrow focus on only atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). We hypothesized that a strategy combining promising biomarkers across multiple different testing modalities would improve global and atherosclerotic CVD risk assessment among individuals without known CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included participants from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) (n=6621) and the Dallas Heart Study (n=2202) who were free from CVD and underwent measurement of left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Associations of test results with the global composite CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary or peripheral revascularization, incident heart failure, or atrial fibrillation) and ASCVD (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) were assessed over >10 years of follow-up. Multivariable analyses for the primary global CVD end point adjusted for traditional risk factors plus statin use and creatinine (base model).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Each test result was independently associated with global composite CVD events in MESA after adjustment for the components of the base model and the other test results (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). When the 5 tests were added to the base model, the c-statistic improved from 0.74 to 0.79 (<i>P</i>=0.001), significant integrated discrimination improvement (0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06–0.08, <i>P</i><0.001) and category free net reclassification improvement (0.47; 95% CI, 0.38–0.56; <i>P</i>=0.003) were observed, and the model was well calibrated (χ<sup>2</sup>=12.2, <i>P</i>=0.20). Using a simple integer score counting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of abnormal tests, compared with those with a score of 0, global CVD risk was increased among participants with a score of 1 (adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6), 2 (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.3–4.4), 3 (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 4.7; 95% CI, 3.4–6.5), and ≥4 (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 7.5; 95% CI, 5.2–10.6). Findings replicated in the Dallas Health Study were similar for the ASCVD outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among adults without known CVD, a novel multimodality testing strategy using left ventricular hypertrophy by ECG, coronary artery calcium, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein significantly improved global CVD and ASCVD risk assessment.</p></sec>

Patients with T1DM were categorized according to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of risk factors not at target: glycohemoglobin, blood pressure, albuminuria, smoking, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Risk of all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization, and stroke was examined in relation to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of risk factors at target.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean follow-up was 10.4 years in the diabetes group. Overall, 2074 of 33 333 patients with diabetes mellitus and 4141 of 166 529 controls died. Risk for all outcomes increased stepwise for each additional risk factor not at target. Adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s for patients achieving all risk factor targets compared with controls were 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93–1.85) for all-cause mortality, 1.82 (95% CI, 1.15–2.88) for acute myocardial infarction, 1.97 (95% CI, 1.04–3.73) for heart failure hospitalization, and 1.17 (95% CI, 0.51–2.68) for stroke.

Specialized Adult Congenital Heart Disease Care
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Clinical guidelines recommend specialized care for adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients. In reality, few patients receive such dedicated care. We sought to examine the impact of specialized care on ACHD patient mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined referral rates to specialized ACHD centers and ACHD patient mortality rates between 1990 and 2005 in the population-based Quebec Congenital Heart Disease database (n=71 467). This period covers several years before and after the publication of guidelines endorsing specialized care for ACHD patients. A time-series design, based on Joinpoint and Poisson regression analyses, was used to assess the changes in annual referral and patient mortality rates. The association between specialized ACHD care and all-cause mortality was assessed in both case–control and cohort studies. The time-series analysis demonstrated a significant increase in referral rates to specialized ACHD centers in 1997 (rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, +7.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], +6.6% to +8.2%). In parallel, a significant reduction in expected ACHD patient mortality was observed after year 2000 (rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, −5.0%;95% CI, −10.8% to −0.8%). In exploratory post hoc cohort and case–control analyses, specialized ACHD care was independently associated with reduced mortality (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.94) and a reduced odds of death (adjusted odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.08–0.97), respectively. This effect was predominantly driven by patients with severe congenital heart disease (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22–0.67).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>A significant increase in referrals to specialized ACHD centers followed the introduction of the clinical guidelines. Moreover, referral to specialized ACHD care was independently associated with a significant mortality reduction. Our findings support a model of specialized care for all ACHD patients.</p></sec>

Long-Term Safety and Effectiveness of Mechanical Versus Biologic Aortic Valve Prostheses in Older Patients
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>There is a paucity of long-term data comparing biological versus mechanical aortic valve prostheses in older individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We performed follow-up of patients aged 65 to 80 years undergoing aortic valve replacement with a biological (n=24 410) or mechanical (n=14 789) prosthesis from 1991 to 1999 at 605 centers within the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database using Medicare inpatient claims (mean, 12.6 years; maximum, 17 years; minimum, 8 years), and outcomes were compared by propensity methods. Among Medicare-linked patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (mean age, 73 years), both reope<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n (4.0%) and endocarditis (1.9%) were uncommon to 12 years; however, the risk for other adverse outcomes was high, including death (66.5%), stroke (14.1%), and bleeding (17.9%). Compared with those receiving a mechanical valve, patients given a bioprosthesis had a similar adjusted risk for death (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.07), higher risks for reope<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 2.14–3.03) and endocarditis (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–1.94), and lower risks for stroke (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.93) and bleeding (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–0.70).

Second Chern number of a quantum-simulated non-Abelian Yang monopole
<p>Topological order is often quantified in terms of Chern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s, each of which classifies a topological singularity. Here, inspired by concepts from high-energy physics, we use quantum simulation based on the spin degrees of freedom of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates to characterize a singularity present in five-dimensional non-Abelian gauge theories—a Yang monopole. We quantify the monopole in terms of Chern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s measured on enclosing manifolds: Whereas the well-known first Chern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> vanishes, the second Chern <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> does not. By displacing the manifold, we induce and observe a topological transition, where the topology of the manifold changes to a trivial state.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant systemic signaling pathways allow the integ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two systemic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts systemically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 systemic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor systemic pathway negatively regulating nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN systemic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>s.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degene<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-linked genes hemizygous in females, we estimate that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-linked genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-linked genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-linked genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Duct Stenting Versus Modified Blalock-Taussig Shunt in Neonates With Duct-Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Infants born with cardiac abnormalities causing dependence on the arterial duct for pulmonary blood flow are often palliated with a shunt usually between the subclavian artery and either pulmonary artery. A so-called modified Blalock-Taussig shunt allows progress through early life to an age and weight at which repair or further more stable palliation can be safely achieved. Modified Blalock-Taussig shunts continue to present concern for postprocedural instability and early mortality such that other alternatives continue to be explored. Duct stenting (DS) is emerging as one such alternative with potential for greater early stability and improved survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The purpose of this study was to compare postprocedural outcomes and survival to next-stage palliative or reparative surgery between patients undergoing a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS in infants with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow. All patients undergoing cardiac surgery and congenital interventions in the United Kingdom are prospectively recruited to an externally validated national outcome audit. From this audit, participating UK centers identified infants <30 days of age undergoing either a Blalock-Taussig shunt or a DS for cardiac conditions with duct-dependent pulmonary blood flow between January 2012 and December 31, 2015. One hundred seventy-one patients underwent a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt, and in 83 patients, DS was attempted. Primary and secondary outcomes of survival and need for extracorporeal support were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Longer-term mortality before repair and reintervention were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards regression. All multivariable analyses accommodated a propensity score to balance patient characteristics between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There was an early (to discharge) survival advantage for infants before next-stage surgery in the DS group (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 4.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.37–13.14; <i>P</i>=0.012).

Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular diseases, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a genetic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure. Using individual-level data from 335 464 participants in the UK Biobank and summary association results from 7 large-scale genome-wide association studies, we examined the effect of this nitric oxide signaling score on cardiometabolic and other diseases. We also examined whether rare loss-of-function mutations in <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> were associated with coronary heart disease using gene sequencing data from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (n=27 815).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling was associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.45; <i>P</i>=5.5*10<sup>–26</sup>], peripheral arterial disease (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; <i>P</i>=0.0005), and stroke (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37-0.76; <i>P</i>=0.0006). In a mediation analysis, the effect of the genetic score on decreased coronary heart disease risk extended beyond its effect on blood pressure. Conversely, rare variants that inactivate the <i>NOS3</i> or <i>GUCY1A3</i> genes were associated with a 23 mm Hg higher systolic blood pressure (95% CI, 12-34; <i>P</i>=5.6*10<sup>–5</sup>) and a 3-fold higher risk of coronary heart disease (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.29-7.12; <i>P</i>=0.01).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling is associated with reduced risks of coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke. Pharmacological stimulation of nitric oxide signaling may prove useful in the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec>

Empagliflozin and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Established Cardiovascular Disease, and Chronic Kidney Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients). Urinary glucose excretion with empagliflozin decreases with declining renal function, resulting in less potency for glucose lowering in patients with kidney disease. We investigated the effects of empagliflozin on clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, established cardiovascular disease, and estimated glomerular filt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> at screening were randomized to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or placebo once daily in addition to standard of care. We analyzed cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality in patients with prevalent kidney disease (defined as eGFR <60 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup> and/or urine albumin-creatinine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> >300 mg/g) at baseline. Additional analyses were performed in subgroups by baseline eGFR (<45, 45–<60, 60–<90, ≥90 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>) and baseline urine albumin-creatinine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> (>300, 30–≤300, <30 mg/g).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 7020 patients treated, 2250 patients had prevalent kidney disease at baseline, of whom 67% had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for >10 years, 58% were receiving insulin, and 84% were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. In patients with prevalent kidney disease at baseline, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death by 29% compared with placebo (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> [HR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52–0.98), the risk of all-cause mortality by 24% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.99), the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 39% (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.87), and the risk of all-cause hospitalization by 19% (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72–0.92). Effects of empagliflozin on these outcomes were consistent across categories of eGFR and urine albumin-creatinine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> at baseline and across the 2 doses studied.

Time to Epinephrine Administration and Survival From Nonshockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Among Children and Adults
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that earlier epinephrine administ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n is associated with improved survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable initial rhythms. However, the effect of epinephrine timing on patients with nonshockable initial rhythms is unclear. The objective of this study was to measure the association between time to epinephrine administ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n and survival in adults and children with emergency medical services (EMS)–treated OHCA with nonshockable initial rhythms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of OHCAs prospectively identified by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium network from June 4, 2011, to June 30, 2015. We included patients of all ages with an EMS-treated OHCA and an initial nonshockable rhythm. We excluded those with return of spontaneous circulation in <10 minutes. We conducted a subgroup analysis involving patients <18 years of age. The primary exposure was time (minutes) from arrival of the first EMS agency to the first dose of epinephrine. Secondary exposure was time to epinephrine dichotomized as early (<10 minutes) or late (≥10 minutes). The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. We adjusted for Utstein covariates and Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium study site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>From 55 568 EMS-treated OHCAs, 32 101 patients with initial nonshockable rhythms were included. There were 12 238 in the early group, 14 517 in the late group, and 5346 not treated with epinephrine. After adjusting for potential confounders, each minute from EMS arrival to epinephrine administ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n was associated with a 4% decrease in odds of survival for adults, odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>=0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.98). A subgroup analysis (n=13 290) examining neurological outcomes showed a similar association (adjusted odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.94 per minute; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.98). When epinephrine was given late in comparison with early, odds of survival were 18% lower (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–0.98). In a pediatric analysis (n=595), odds of survival were 9% lower (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.01) for each minute delay in epinephrine.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among OHCAs with nonshockable initial rhythms, the majority of patients were administered epinephrine >10 minutes after EMS arrival. Each minute delay in epinephrine administ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n was associated with decreased survival and unfavorable neurological outcomes. EMS agencies should consider strategies to reduce epinephrine administ<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n times in patients with initial nonshockable rhythms.</p></sec>

Association of Statin Dose With Amputation and Survival in Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Statin dose guidelines for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) are largely based on coronary artery disease and stroke data. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of statin intensity on PAD outcomes of amputation and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using an observational cohort study design and a validated algorithm, we identified patients with incident PAD (2003–2014) in the national Veterans Affairs data. Highest statin intensity exposure (high-intensity versus low-to-moderate–intensity versus antiplatelet therapy but no statin use) was determined within 1 year of diagnosis of PAD. Outcomes of interest were lower extremity amputations and death. The association of statin intensity with incident amputation and mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots, Cox proportional hazards modeling, propensity score–matched analysis, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses, as well, to reduce confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In 155 647 patients with incident PAD, more than a quarter (28%) were not on statins. Use of high-intensity statins was lowest in patients with PAD only (6.4%) in comparison with comorbid coronary/carotid disease (18.4%). Incident amputation and mortality risk declined significantly with any statin use in comparison with the antiplatelet therapy–only group. In adjusted Cox models, the high-intensity statin users were associated with lower amputation risk and mortality in comparison with antiplatelet therapy–only users (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.74 and hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.77, respectively). Low-to-moderate–intensity statins also had significant reductions in the risk of amputation and mortality (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> amputation, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.75– 0.86; hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> death, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86) in comparison with no statins (antiplatelet therapy only), but effect size was significantly weaker than the high-intensity statins (<i>P</i><0.001). The association of high-intensity statins with lower amputation and death risk remained significant and robust in propensity score–matched, sensitivity, and subgroup analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Statins, especially high-intensity formulations, are underused in patients with PAD. This is the first population-based study to show that high-intensity statin use at the time of PAD diagnosis is associated with a significant reduction in limb loss and mortality in comparison with low-to-moderate–intensity statin users, and patients treated only with antiplatelet medications but not with statins, as well.</p></sec>

Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction and Myocardial Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are common in clinical practice, but long-term consequences are uncertain. We aimed to define long-term outcomes and explore risk stratification in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified consecutive patients (n=2122) with elevated cardiac troponin I concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>ns (≥0.05 µg/L) at a tertiary cardiac center. All diagnoses were adjudicated as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) and noncardiovascular death. To explore competing risks, cause-specific hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s were obtained using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The adjudicated index diagnosis was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively. At 5 years, all-cause death rates were higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (62.5%) or myocardial injury (72.4%) compared with type 1 myocardial infarction (36.7%). The majority of excess deaths in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were because of noncardiovascular causes (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.92–2.81 versus type 1 myocardial infarction). Despite this finding, the observed crude major adverse cardiovascular event rates were similar between groups (30.6% versus 32.6%), with differences apparent after adjustment for covariates (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.96). Coronary heart disease was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.24).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite an excess in noncardiovascular death, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury have a similar crude rate of major adverse cardiovascular events as those with type 1 myocardial infarction. Identifying underlying coronary heart disease in this vulnerable population may help target therapies that could modify future risk.</p></sec>

Black-White Differences in Incident Fatal, Nonfatal, and Total Coronary Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Blacks have higher coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality compared with whites. However, a previous study suggests that nonfatal CHD risk may be lower for black versus white men.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We compared fatal and nonfatal CHD incidence and CHD case-fatality among blacks and whites in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (ARIC), the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), and the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS) by sex. Participants 45 to 64 years of age in ARIC (men=6479, women=8488) and REGARDS (men=5296, women=7822), and ≥65 years of age in CHS (men=1836, women=2790) and REGARDS (men=3381, women=4112), all without a history of CHD, were analyzed. Fatal and nonfatal CHD incidence was assessed from baseline (ARIC=1987–1989, CHS=1989–1990, REGARDS=2003–2007) through up to 11 years of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Age-adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s comparing black versus white men 45 to 64 years of age in ARIC and REGARDS were 2.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.42–3.06) and 2.11 (1.32–3.38), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 0.82 (0.64–1.05) and 0.94 (0.69–1.28), respectively, for nonfatal CHD. After adjustment for social determinants of health and cardiovascular risk factors, hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s in ARIC and REGARDS were 1.19 (95% confidence interval, 0.74–1.92) and 1.09 (0.62–1.93), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 0.64 (0.47–0.86) and 0.67 (0.48–0.95), respectively, for nonfatal CHD. Similar patterns were present among men ≥65 years of age in CHS and REGARDS. Among women 45 to 64 years of age in ARIC and REGARDS, age-adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s comparing blacks versus whites were 2.61 (95% confidence interval, 1.57–4.34) and 1.79 (1.06–3.03), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 1.47 (1.13–1.91) and 1.29 (0.91–1.83), respectively, for nonfatal CHD. After multivariable adjustment, hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s in ARIC and REGARDS were 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.36–1.24) and 1.00 (0.54–1.85), respectively, for fatal CHD, and 0.70 (0.51–0.97) and 0.70 (0.46–1.06), respectively, for nonfatal CHD. Racial differences in CHD incidence were attenuated among older women. CHD case fatality was higher among black versus white men and women, and the difference remained similar after multivariable adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>After accounting for social determinants of health and risk factors, black men and women have similar risk for fatal CHD compared with white men and women, respectively.

Body Mass Index and Mortality Among Adults Undergoing Cardiac Surgery
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In an apparent paradox, morbidity and mortality are lower in obese patients undergoing cardiac surgery, although the nature of this association is unclear. We sought to determine whether the obesity paradox observed in cardiac surgery is attributable to reverse epidemiology, bias, or confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data from the National Adult Cardiac Surgery registry for all cardiac surgical procedures performed between April 2002 and March 2013 were extracted. A parallel systematic review and meta-analysis (MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library) through June 2015 were also accomplished. Exposure of interest was body mass index categorized into 6 groups according to the World Health Organization classification.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 401 227 adult patients in the cohort study and 557 720 patients in the systematic review were included. A U-shaped association between mortality and body mass index classes was observed in both studies, with lower mortality in overweight (adjusted odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.83) and obese class I and II (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76–0.86; and odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.94) patients relative to normal-weight patients and increased mortality in underweight individuals (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.41–1.62). In the cohort study, a U-shaped relationship was observed for stroke and low cardiac output syndrome but not for renal replacement therapy or deep sternal wound infection. Counter to the reverse epidemiology hypotheses, the protective effects of obesity were less in patients with severe chronic renal, lung, or cardiac disease and greater in older patients and in those with complications of obesity, including the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. Adjustments for important confounders did not alter our results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Obesity is associated with lower risks after cardiac surgery, with consistent effects noted in multiple analyses attempting to address residual confounding and reverse causation.</p></sec>

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier age at menopause is widely considered to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart disease, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart disease (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart disease (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

Impact of Computed Tomography Perfusion Imaging on the Response to Tenecteplase in Ischemic Stroke
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We pooled 2 clinical trials of tenecteplase compared with alteplase for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, 1 that demonstrated superiority of tenecteplase and the other that showed no difference between the treatments in patient clinical outcomes. We tested the hypotheses that reperfusion therapy with tenecteplase would be superior to alteplase in improving functional outcomes in the group of patients with target mismatch as identified with advanced imaging.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We investigated whether tenecteplase-treated patients had a different 24-hour reduction in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and a favorable odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 1 versus 2 to 6 compared with alteplase-treated patients using linear regression to generate odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s. Imaging outcomes included rates of vessel recanalization and infarct growth at 24 hours and occurrence of large parenchymal hematoma. Baseline computed tomography perfusion was analyzed to assess whether patients met the target mismatch criteria (absolute mismatch volume >15 mL, mismatch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> >1.8, baseline ischemic core <70 mL, and volume of severely hypoperfused tissue <100 mL).

Recurrent Hospitalization Among Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Intracoronary Stenting Treated With 2 Treatment Strategies of Rivaroxaban or a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment Strategy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with atrial fibrillation who undergo intracoronary stenting traditionally are treated with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) plus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), yet this treatment leads to high risks of bleeding.

Cardiac Outcomes After Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Insulin resistance is highly prevalent among patients with atherosclerosis and is associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. The IRIS trial (Insulin Resistance Intervention after Stroke) demonstrated that pioglitazone decreased the composite risk for fatal or nonfatal stroke and MI in patients with insulin resistance without diabetes mellitus, after a recent ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. The type and severity of cardiac events in this population and the impact of pioglitazone on these events have not been described.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a secondary analysis of the effects of pioglitazone, in comparison with placebo, on acute coronary syndromes (MI and unstable angina) among IRIS participants. All potential acute coronary syndrome episodes were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by an independent clinical events committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study cohort was composed of 3876 IRIS participants, mean age 63 years, 65% male, 89% white race, and 12% with a history of coronary artery disease. Over a median follow-up of 4.8 years, there were 225 acute coronary syndrome events, including 141 MIs and 84 episodes of unstable angina. The MIs included 28 (19%) with ST-segment elevation. The majority of MIs were type 1 (94, 65%), followed by type 2 (45, 32%). Serum troponin was 10× to 100× upper limit of normal in 49 (35%) and >100× upper limit of normal in 39 (28%). Pioglitazone reduced the risk of acute coronary syndrome (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.54–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.02). Pioglitazone also reduced the risk of type 1 MI (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.40–0.96; log-rank <i>P</i>=0.03), but not type 2 MI (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.58–1.91; <i>P</i>=0.87).

Potential Deaths Averted and Serious Adverse Events Incurred From Adoption of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) Intensive Blood Pressure Regimen in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) demonstrated a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 versus <140 mm Hg among US adults at high cardiovascular disease risk but without diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart failure. To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive goal implementation, we estimated the deaths prevented and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked with the National Death Index through December 2011. SPRINT eligibility included age ≥50 years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg (depending on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of antihypertensive medications being taken), and high cardiovascular disease risk. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart failure, estimated glomerular filt<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n rate <20 mL·min<sup>−1</sup>·1.73 m<sup>−2</sup>, or dialysis. Annual mortality rates were calculated by dividing the Kaplan-Meier 5-year mortality by 5. Hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s for all-cause mortality and heart failure and absolute risks for serious adverse events in SPRINT were used to estimate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of potential deaths and heart failure cases prevented and serious adverse events incurred with intensive SBP treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 68.6 years, and 83.2% and 7.4% were non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, respectively. The annual mortality rate was 2.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91–2.48), and intensive SBP treatment was projected to prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year (95% CI, 93 300–121 200) and give rise to 56 100 (95% CI, 50 800–61 400) episodes of hypotension, 34 400 (95% CI, 31 200–37 600) episodes of syncope, 43 400 (95% CI, 39 400–47 500) serious electrolyte disorders, and 88 700 (95% CI, 80 400–97 000) cases of acute kidney injury per year. The analysis-of-extremes approach indicated that the range of estimated lower- and upper-bound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of deaths prevented per year with intensive SBP control was 34 600 to 179 600. Intensive SBP control was projected to prevent 46 100 (95% CI, 41 800–50 400) cases of heart failure annually.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>If fully implemented in eligible US adults, intensive SBP treatment could prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year.

Outcome of the Swedish Nationwide Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Program
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A general abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening program, targeting 65-year-old men, has gradually been introduced in Sweden since 2006 and reached nationwide coverage in 2015. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of this program.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Data on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of invited and examined men, screening-detected AAAs, AAAs operated on, and surgical outcome were retrieved from all 21 Swedish counties for the years 2006 through 2014. AAA-specific mortality data were retrieved from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. A linear regression analysis was used to estimate the effect on AAA-specific mortality among all men ≥65 years of age for the observed time period. The long-term effects were projected by using a validated Markov model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 302 957 men aged 65 years invited, 84% attended. The prevalence of screening-detected AAA was 1.5%. After a mean of 4.5 years, 29% of patients with AAA had been operated on, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9% (1.3% after open repair and 0.3% after endovascular repair, <i>P</i><0.001). The introduction of screening was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-specific mortality (mean, 4.0% per year of screening, <i>P</i>=0.020). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> needed to screen and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> needed to operate on to prevent 1 premature death were 667 and 1.5, respectively. With a total population of 9.5 million, the Swedish national AAA-screening program was predicted to annually prevent 90 premature deaths from AAA and to gain 577 quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-efficiency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> was estimated to be €7770 per quality-adjusted life-years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Screening 65-year-old men for AAA is an effective preventive health measure and is highly cost-effective in a contemporary setting. These findings confirm the results from earlier randomized controlled trials and model studies in a large population-based setting of the importance for future healthcare decision making.</p></sec>

Transplantation-Free Survival and Interventions at 3 Years in the Single Ventricle Reconstruction Trial
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>In the Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) trial, 1-year transplantation-free survival was better for the Norwood procedure with right ventricle–to–pulmonary artery shunt (RVPAS) compared with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS). At 3 years, we compared transplantation-free survival, echocardiographic right ventricular ejection fraction, and unplanned interventions in the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Vital status and medical history were ascertained from annual medical records, death indexes, and phone interviews. The cohort included 549 patients randomized and treated in the SVR trial. Transplantation-free survival for the RVPAS versus MBTS groups did not differ at 3 years (67% versus 61%; <i>P</i>=0.15) or with all available follow-up of 4.8±1.1 years (log-rank <i>P</i>=0.14). Pre-Fontan right ventricular ejection fraction was lower in the RVPAS group than in the MBTS group (41.7<i>±</i>5.1% versus 44.7<i>±</i>6.0%; <i>P</i>=0.007), and right ventricular ejection fraction deteriorated in RVPAS (<i>P</i>=0.004) but not MBTS (<i>P</i>=0.40) subjects (pre-Fontan minus 14-month mean, −3.25±8.24% versus 0.99±8.80%; <i>P</i>=0.009). The RVPAS versus MBTS treatment effect had nonproportional hazards (<i>P</i>=0.004); the hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> favored the RVPAS before 5 months (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>=0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.88) but the MBTS beyond 1 year (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>=2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–4.62). By 3 years, RVPAS subjects had a higher incidence of catheter interventions (<i>P</i><0.001) with an increasing HR over time (<i>P</i>=0.005): <5 months, 1.14 (95% confidence interval, 0.81–1.60); from 5 months to 1 year, 1.94 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–3.69); and >1 year, 2.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.28–4.80).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>By 3 years, the Norwood procedure with RVPAS compared with MBTS was no longer associated with superior transplantation-free survival.

Survey of a Protocol to Increase Appropriate Implementation of Dispatcher-Assisted Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR) attempts to improve the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by laypersons who are unable to recognize cardiac arrest and are unfamiliar with CPR. Therefore, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of our new DA-CPR protocol for achieving implementation of bystander CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims not already receiving bystander CPR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Since 2007, we have applied a new DA-CPR protocol that uses supplementary key words. Fire departments prospectively collected baseline data on DA-CPR from January 2009 to December 2011. DA-CPR was attempted in 2747 patients; of these, 417 (15.2%) did not experience cardiac arrest. The sensitivity and specificity of the 2007 protocol versus estimated values of the previous standard protocol were 72.9% versus 50.3% and 99.6% versus 99.8%, respectively. We identified key words that may be useful for detecting out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the occurrence of cardiac arrest after an emergency call (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 16.85) and placing an emergency call away from the scene of the arrest (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 11.04) were potentially associated with failure to provide DA-CPR. Furthermore, at-home cardiac arrest (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.61) and family members as bystanders (odds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.55) were associated with bystander noncompliance with DA-CPR. No complications were reported in the 417 patients who received DA-CPR but did not have cardiac arrest.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Our 2007 protocol is safe and highly specific and may be more sensitive than the standard protocol. Understanding the factors associated with failure of bystanders to provide DA-CPR and implementing public education are necessary to increase the benefit of DA-CPR.</p></sec>

Genetic Determinants of Dabigatran Plasma Levels and Their Relation to Bleeding
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Fixed-dose unmonitored treatment with dabigatran etexilate is effective and has a favorable safety profile in the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation patients compared with warfarin. We hypothesized that genetic variants could contribute to interindividual variability in blood concent<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>ns of the active metabolite of dabigatran etexilate and influence the safety and efficacy of dabigatran.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We successfully conducted a genome-wide association study in 2944 Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) participants.

Effects of Bariatric Surgery in Obese Patients With Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent research efforts on bariatric surgery have focused on metabolic and diabetes mellitus resolution. Randomized trials designed to assess the impact of bariatric surgery in patients with obesity and hypertension are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this randomized, single-center, nonblinded trial, we included patients with hypertension (using ≥2 medications at maximum doses or >2 at moderate doses) and a body mass index between 30.0 and 39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Patients were randomized to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone. The primary end point was reduction of ≥30% of the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of antihypertensive medications while maintaining systolic and diastolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg and 90 mm Hg, respectively, at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 100 patients (70% female, mean age 43.8±9.2 years, mean body mass index 36.9±2.7 kg/m2), and 96% completed follow-up. Reduction of ≥30% of the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of antihypertensive medications while maintaining controlled blood pressure occurred in 41 of 49 patients from the gastric bypass group (83.7%) compared with 6 of 47 patients (12.8%) from the control group with a rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of 6.6 (95% confidence interval, 3.1–14.0; <i>P</i><0.001). Remission of hypertension was present in 25 of 49 (51%) and 22 of 48 (45.8%) patients randomized to gastric bypass, considering office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, respectively, whereas no patient submitted to medical therapy was free of antihypertensive drugs at 12 months. A post hoc analysis for the primary end point considering the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) target reached consistent results, with a rate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.4–10.6; <i>P</i>=0.005). Eleven patients (22.4%) from the gastric bypass group and none in the control group were able to achieve SPRINT levels without antihypertensives.

Effect of Intensive Blood Pressure Lowering on Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in Patients With Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>It is currently unknown whether intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering beyond that recommended would lead to more lowering of the risk of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with hypertension and whether reducing the risk of LVH explains the reported cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefits of intensive BP lowering in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This analysis included 8164 participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 35.3% women; 31.2% blacks) with hypertension but no diabetes mellitus from the SPRINT trial (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial): 4086 randomly assigned to intensive BP lowering (target SBP <120 mm Hg) and 4078 assigned to standard BP lowering (target SBP <140 mm Hg). Progression and regression of LVH as defined by Cornell voltage criteria derived from standard 12-lead ECGs recorded at baseline and biannually were compared between treatment arms during a median follow-up of 3.81 years. The effect of intensive (versus standard) BP lowering on the SPRINT primary CVD outcome (a composite of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart failure, and CVD death) was compared before and after adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among SPRINT participants without baseline LVH (n=7559), intensive (versus standard) BP lowering was associated with a 46% lower risk of developing LVH (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>=0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.43–0.68). Similarly, among SPRINT participants with baseline LVH (n=605, 7.4%), those assigned to the intensive (versus standard) BP lowering were 66% more likely to regress/improve their LVH (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>=1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.11). Adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate did not substantially attenuate the effect of intensive BP therapy on CVD events (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> of intensive versus standard BP lowering on CVD, 0.76 [95% confidence interval, 0.64–0.90] and 0.77 [95% confidence interval, 0.65–0.91] before and after adjustment for LVH as a time-varying covariate, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with hypertension but no diabetes mellitus, intensive BP lowering (target systolic BP <120 mm Hg) compared with standard BP lowering (target systolic BP <140 mm Hg) resulted in lower rates of developing new LVH in those without LVH and higher rates of regression of LVH in those with existing LVH. This favorable effect on LVH did not explain most of the reduction in CVD events associated with intensive BP lowering in the SPRINT trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Regist<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Prevention of Stroke with the Addition of Ezetimibe to Statin Therapy in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients who experience an acute coronary syndrome are at heightened risk of recurrent ischemic events, including stroke. Ezetimibe improved cardiovascular outcomes when added to statin therapy in patients stabilized after acute coronary syndrome. We investigated the efficacy of the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin for the prevention of stroke and other adverse cardiovascular events in IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), with a focus on patients with a stroke before randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients who experienced acute coronary syndrome were randomized to a placebo/simvastatin or ezetimibe/simvastatin regimen and followed for a median of 6 years. Treatment efficacy was assessed for the entire population and by subgroups for the first and total (first and subsequent) events for the end points of stroke of any etiology, stroke subtypes, and the primary trial end point at 7 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 18 144 patients, 641 (3.5%) experienced at least 1 stroke; most were ischemic (527, 82%). Independent predictors of stroke included prior stroke, older age, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, and renal dysfunction. There was a nonsignificant reduction in the first event of stroke of any etiology (4.2% versus 4.8%; hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73–1.00; <i>P</i>=0.052) with ezetimibe/simvastatin versus placebo/simvastatin, driven by a significant 21% reduction in ischemic stroke (3.4% versus 4.1%; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67–0.94; <i>P</i>=0.008) and a nonsignificant increase in hemorrhagic stroke (0.8% versus 0.6%; HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.93–2.04; <i>P</i>=0.11). Evaluating total events, including the first and all recurrent strokes, ezetimibe/simvastatin reduced stroke of any etiology (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.029) and ischemic stroke (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.003).

Assessment of Remote Heart Rhythm Sampling Using the AliveCor Heart Monitor to Screen for Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly common in the aging population and implicated in many ischemic strokes. Earlier identification of AF with appropriate anticoagulation may decrease stroke morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial of AF screening using an AliveCor Kardia monitor attached to a WiFi-enabled iPod to obtain ECGs (iECGs) in ambulatory patients. Patients ≥65 years of age with a CHADS-VASc score ≥2 free from AF were randomized to the iECG arm or routine care (RC). iECG participants acquired iECGs twice weekly over 12 months (plus additional iECGs if symptomatic) onto a secure study server with overread by an automated AF detection algorithm and by a cardiac physiologist and/or consultant cardiologist. Time to diagnosis of AF was the primary outcome measure. The overall cost of the devices, ECG interpretation, and patient management were captured and used to generate the cost per AF diagnosis in iECG patients. Clinical events and patient attitudes/experience were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1001 patients (500 iECG, 501 RC) who were 72.6±5.4 years of age; 534 were female. Mean CHADS-VASc score was 3.0 (heart failure, 1.4%; hypertension, 54%; diabetes mellitus, 30%; prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, 6.5%; arterial disease, 15.9%; all CHADS-VASc risk factors were evenly distributed between groups). Nineteen patients in the iECG group were diagnosed with AF over the 12-month study period versus 5 in the RC arm (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 3.9; 95% confidence interval=1.4–10.4; <i>P</i>=0.007) at a cost per AF diagnosis of $10 780 (£8255). There was a similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolic events (6 versus 10, iECG versus RC; hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>=0.61; 95% confidence interval=0.22–1.69; <i>P</i>=0.34). The majority of iECG patients were satisfied with the device, finding it easy to use without restricting activities or causing anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Screening with twice-weekly single-lead iECG with remote interpretation in ambulatory patients ≥65 years of age at increased risk of stroke is significantly more likely to identify incident AF than RC over a 12-month period. This approach is also highly acceptable to this group of patients, supporting further evaluation in an appropriately powered, event-driven clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Regist<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>n:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

A Population-Based Study of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Treatment in Finland 2000 to 2014
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the event of rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), mortality is very high. AAA prevalence and incidence of ruptures have been reported to be decreasing. The treatment of AAA has also undergone a change in recent decades with a shift toward endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Our aim was to evaluate how these changes have affected the elective and emergency treatment of AAA and their results in Finland.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All patients treated for AAA in Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million, during 2000 to 2014 were searched from the registry of the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. Data on all patients who had died of AAA during the same time period were obtained from Statistics Finland. The data were combined and analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The annual incidence of ruptured AAA was 16.4 per 100 000 population over 50 years and decreased significantly during the study period. Over half of the 4949 patients who had a ruptured AAA died outside the hospital. Thirty-day mortality after emergency repair was 39.4%. Intact AAA repairs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>ed 4956. The absolute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of annual repairs increased during the study period, and the use of EVAR became the dominant method of elective repair. Thirty-day mortality in elective AAA repair dropped significantly from 6.3% in 2000 to 2004 to 2.7% in 2010 to 2014 mostly because of the increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong> of EVAR procedures with lower mortality. Long-term mortality in patients treated with EVAR was higher than in patients treated with open repair. Mortality after elective AAA repair was primarily attributable to cardiovascular causes, but there was a slightly higher proportion of AAA-related late deaths in patients treated with EVAR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Ruptured AAA incidence for men >65 years has declined by nearly 30% in Finland, likely because of the decrease in AAA prevalence. The treatment results have improved as well for both elective and emergency repair. Increased use of EVAR has resulted in a decrease of mortality after elective AAA repair, but results of open repair have improved as well. However, late mortality from elective EVAR is surprisingly high in comparison with open repair, which may have been exaggerated by patient selection.</p></sec>

Genetic Obesity and the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Observational studies have identified an association between body mass index (BMI) and incident atrial fibrillation (AF). Inferring causality from observational studies, however, is subject to residual confounding, reverse causation, and bias. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the causal association between BMI and AF by using genetic predictors of BMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified 51 646 individuals of European ancestry without AF at baseline from 7 prospective population-based cohorts initiated between 1987 and 2002 in the United States, Iceland, and the Netherlands with incident AF ascertained between 1987 and 2012. Cohort-specific mean follow-up ranged from 7.4 to 19.2 years, over which period there was a total of 4178 cases of incident AF. We performed a Mendelian randomization with instrumental variable analysis to estimate a cohort-specific causal hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> for the association between BMI and AF. Two genetic instruments for BMI were used: <i>FTO</i> genotype (rs1558902) and a BMI gene score comprising 39 single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified by genome-wide association studies to be associated with BMI. Cohort-specific estimates were combined by random-effects, inverse variance–weighted meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In age- and sex-adjusted meta-analysis, both genetic instruments were significantly associated with BMI (<i>FTO</i>: 0.43 [95% confidence interval, 0.32–0.54] kg/m<sup>2</sup> per A-allele, <i>P</i><0.001; BMI gene score: 1.05 [95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.20] kg/m<sup>2</sup> per 1-U increase, <i>P</i><0.001) and incident AF (<i>FTO</i>, hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.07 [1.02–1.11] per A-allele, <i>P</i>=0.004; BMI gene score, hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.11 [1.05–1.18] per 1-U increase, <i>P</i><0.001). Age- and sex-adjusted instrumental variable estimates for the causal association between BMI and incident AF were hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.15 (1.04–1.26) per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i>=0.005 (<i>FTO</i>) and 1.11 (1.05–1.17) per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i><0.001 (BMI gene score). Both of these estimates were consistent with the meta-analyzed estimate between observed BMI and AF (age- and sex-adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong> 1.05 [1.04–1.06] per kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i><0.001). Multivariable adjustment did not significantly change findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data are consistent with a causal relationship between BMI and incident AF. These data support the possibility that public health initiatives targeting primordial prevention of obesity may reduce the incidence of AF.</p></sec>

Low-Dose Aspirin for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The long-term efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are still inconclusive.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The JPAD trial (Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis With Aspirin for Diabetes) was a randomized, open-label, standard care–controlled trial examining whether low-dose aspirin affected cardiovascular events in 2539 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without preexisting cardiovascular disease. Patients were randomly allocated to receive aspirin (81 or 100 mg daily; aspirin group) or no aspirin (no-aspirin group) in the JPAD trial. After that trial ended in 2008, we followed up with the patients until 2015, with no attempt to change the previously assigned therapy. Primary end points were cardiovascular events, including sudden death, fatal or nonfatal coronary artery disease, fatal or nonfatal stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. For the safety analysis, hemorrhagic events, consisting of gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, and bleeding from any other sites, were also analyzed. The primary analysis was conducted for cardiovascular events among patients who retained their original allocation (a per-protocol cohort). Analyses on an intention-to-treat cohort were conducted for hemorrhagic events and statistical sensitivity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The median follow-up period was 10.3 years; 1621 patients (64%) were followed up throughout the study; and 2160 patients (85%) retained their original allocation.

Sex Differences in 1-Year All-Cause Rehospitalization in Patients After Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with men, women are at higher risk of rehospitalization in the first month after discharge for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, it is unknown whether this risk extends to the full year and varies by age. Explanatory factors potentially mediating the relationship between sex and rehospitalization remain unexplored and are needed to reduce readmissions. The aim of this study was to assess sex differences and factors associated with 1-year rehospitalization rates after AMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We recruited 3536 patients (33% women) ≥18 years of age hospitalized with AMI from 24 US centers into the TRIUMPH study (Translational Research Investigating Underlying Disparities in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients’ Health Status). Data were obtained by medical record abstraction and patient interviews, and a physician panel adjudicated hospitalizations within the first year after AMI. We compared sex differences in rehospitalization using a Cox proportional hazards model, following sequential adjustment for covariates and testing for an age-sex interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One-year crude all-cause rehospitalization rates for women were significantly higher than men after AMI (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.29 for women; 95% confidence interval, 1.12−1.48). After adjustment for demographics and clinical factors, women had a persistent 26% higher risk of rehospitalization (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.08−1.47). However, after adjustment for health status and psychosocial factors (hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.96−1.35), the association was attenuated. No significant age-sex interaction was found for 1-year rehospitalization, suggesting that the increased risk applied to both older and younger women.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Regardless of age, women have a higher risk of rehospitalization compared with men over the first year after AMI. Although the increased risk persisted after adjustment for clinical factors, the poorer health and psychosocial state of women attenuated the difference.</p></sec>

Coronary Artery Calcium to Guide a Personalized Risk-Based Approach to Initiation and Intensification of Antihypertensive Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The use of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk to personalize systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment goals is a topic of increasing interest. Therefore, we studied whether coronary artery calcium (CAC) can further guide the allocation of anti-hypertensive treatment intensity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We included 3733 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with SBP between 120 and 179 mm Hg. Within subgroups categorized by both SBP (120–139 mm Hg, 140–159 mm Hg, and 160–179 mm Hg) and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk (using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Assocation pooled-cohort equations), we compared multivariable-adjusted hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s for the composite outcome of incident ASCVD or heart failure after further stratifying by CAC (0, 1–100, or >100). We estimated 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>-needed-to-treat for an intensive SBP goal of 120 mm Hg by applying the treatment benefit recorded in meta-analyses to event rates within CAC strata.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean age was 65 years, and 642 composite events took place over a median of 10.2 years. In persons with SBP <160 mm Hg, CAC stratified risk for events. For example, among those with an ASCVD risk of <15% and who had an SBP of either 120 to 139 mm Hg or 140 to 159 mm Hg, respectively, we found increasing hazard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ratio</span></strong>s for events with CAC 1 to 100 (1.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.0–2.6] or 2.0 [1.1–3.8]) and CAC >100 (3.0 [1.8–5.0] or 5.7 [2.9–11.0]), all relative to CAC=0. There appeared to be no statistical association between CAC and events when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg, irrespective of ASCVD risk level. Estimated 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>-needed-to-treat for a SBP goal of 120mmHg varied substantially according to CAC levels when predicted ASCVD risk <15% and SBP <160mmHg (eg, 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>-needed-to-treat of 99 for CAC=0 and 24 for CAC>100, when SBP 120-139mm Hg). However, few participants with ASCVD risk <5% had elevated CAC. Furthermore, 10-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">number</span></strong>-needed-to-treat estimates were consistently low and varied less among CAC strata when SBP was 160 to 179 mm Hg or when ASCVD risk was ≥15% at any SBP level.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Combined CAC imaging and assessment of global ASCVD risk has the potential to guide personalized SBP goals (eg, choosing a traditional goal of 140 or a more intensive goal of 120 mm Hg), particularly among adults with an estimated ASCVD risk of 5% to 15% and prehypertension or mild hypertension.</p></sec>

5-oxoETE triggers nociception in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome through MAS-related G protein–coupled receptor D
<p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by chronic abdominal pain concurrent with altered bowel habit. Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolites are increased in abundance in IBS and are implicated in the alteration of sensation to mechanical stimuli, which is defined as visceral hypersensitivity. We sought to quantify PUFA metabolites in patients with IBS and evaluate their role in pain. Quantification of PUFA metabolites by mass spectrometry in colonic biopsies showed an increased abundance of 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxoETE) only in biopsies taken from patients with IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C). Local administration of 5-oxoETE to mice induced somatic and visceral hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli without causing tissue inflammation. We found that 5-oxoETE directly acted on both human and mouse sensory neurons as shown by lumbar splanchnic nerve recordings and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We showed that 5-oxoETE selectively stimulated nonpeptidergic, isolectin B4 (IB4)–positive DRG neurons through a phospholipase C (PLC)– and pertussis toxin–dependent mechanism, suggesting that the effect was mediated by a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR). The MAS-related GPCR D (Mrgprd) was found in mouse colonic DRG afferents and was identified as being implicated in the noxious effects of 5-oxoETE. Together, these data suggest that 5-oxoETE, a potential biomarker of IBS-C, induces somatic and visceral hyperalgesia without inflammation in an Mrgprd-dependent manner. Thus, 5-oxoETE may play a pivotal role in the abdominal pain associated with IBS-C.</p>

Intracellular cavity of sensor domain controls allosteric gating of TRPA1 channel
<p>Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a temperature-sensitive ion channel activated by various pungent and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irrit</span></strong>ant compounds that can produce pain in humans. Its activation involves an allosteric mechanism whereby electrophilic agonists evoke interactions within cytosolic domains and open the channel pore through an integrated nexus formed by intracellular membrane proximal regions that are densely packed beneath the lower segment of the S1–S4 sensor domain. Studies indicate that this part of the channel may contain residues that form a water-accessible cavity that undergoes changes in solvation during channel gating. We identified conserved polar residues facing the putative lower crevice of the sensor domain that were crucial determinants of the electrophilic, voltage, and calcium sensitivity of the TRPA1 channel. This part of the sensor may also comprise a domain capable of binding to membrane phosphoinositides through which gating of the channel is regulated in a state-dependent manner.</p>

Digital chemical test impresses
<p>Toxicologists this week unveiled a chemical safety screening tool that could greatly reduce the need for six common animal tests. Those tests account for nearly 60% of the estimated 3 million to 4 million animals used annually in risk testing worldwide. The computerized tool—built on a massive database of molecular structures and existing safety data—appears to match, and sometimes improve on, the results of animal tests for properties such as skin sensitization and eye <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">irrit</span></strong>ation, the researchers report in today's issue of <i>Toxicological Sciences</i>. But it also has limitations; for instance, the method can't reliably evaluate a chemical's risk of causing cancer. And it's not clear how open regulatory agencies will be to adopting a nonanimal approach, although both European and U.S. regulators say they are open to the idea. Still, the big data approach is encouraging to those seeking to reduce and replace animal testing.</p>

Large Numbers of Novel miRNAs Originate from DNA Transposons and Are Coincident with a Large Species Radiation in Bats
<p>Vesper bats (family Vespertilionidae) experienced a rapid adaptive radiation beginning around 36 Ma that resulted in the second most species-rich mammalian family (>400 species). Coincident with that radiation was an initial burst of DNA transposon activity that has continued into the present in some species. Such extensive and recent DNA transposon activity has not been seen in any other extant mammal. Indeed, retrotransposon activity is much more common in all other sequenced mammal genomes. Deep sequencing of the small RNA fraction from a vespertilionid bat, <i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, as well as a dog and horse revealed large numbers of 17–24 bp putative miRNAs (p/miRNAs). Although the origination rate of p/miRNAs is similar in all three taxa, 61.1% of postdivergence p/miRNAs in <i>Eptesicus</i> are derived from transposable elements (TEs) compared with only 23.9% and 16.5% in the dog and horse, respectively. Not surprisingly, given the retrotransposon bias of dog and horse, the majority of TE-derived p/miRNAs are associated with retrotransposons. In <i>Eptesicus</i>, however, 58.7% of the TE-derived and 35.9% of the total p/miRNAs arose not from retrotransposons but from bat-specific DNA transposons. Notably, we observe that the timing of the DNA transposon expansion and the resulting introduction of novel p/miRNAs coincide with the rapid diversification of the family Vespertilionidae. Furthermore, potential targets of the DNA transposon-derived p/miRNAs are identifiable and enriched for genes that are important for regulation of transcription. We propose that lineage-specific DNA transposon activity lead to the rapid and repeated introduction of novel p/miRNAs. Some of these p/miRNAs are likely functional miRNAs and potentially influenced the diversification of Vespertilionidae. Our observations suggest a mechanism for introducing functional genomic variation rapidly through the expansion of DNA transposons that fits within the TE-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">thrust</span></strong> hypothesis.</p>

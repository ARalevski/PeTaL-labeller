Root Tip Shape Governs Root Elongation Rate under Increased Soil Strength
<p>Increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> compaction or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying is a major limitation to root growth and crop productivity. Roots need to exert higher penetration force, resulting in increased penetration stress when elongating in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s of greater strength. This study aimed to quantify how the genotypic diversity of root tip geometry and root diameter influences root elongation under different levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength and to determine the extent to which roots adjust to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Fourteen wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) varieties were grown in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> columns packed to three bulk densities representing low, moderate, and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Under moderate and high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength, smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio was correlated with higher genotypic root elongation rate, whereas root diameter was not related to genotypic root elongation. Based on cavity expansion theory, it was found that smaller root tip radius-to-length ratio reduced penetration stress, thus enabling higher root elongation rates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s with greater strength. Furthermore, it was observed that roots could only partially adjust to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. Root thickening was bounded by a maximum diameter, and root tips did not become more acute in response to increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength. The obtained results demonstrated that root tip geometry is a pivotal trait governing root penetration stress and root elongation rate in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s of greater strength. Hence, root tip shape needs to be taken into account when selecting for crop varieties that may tolerate high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strength.</p>

High complexity of aquatic irradiance may have driven the evolution of four-dimensional colour vision in shallow-water fish
<p>Humans use three cone photoreceptor classes for colour vision, yet many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s, reptiles and shallow-water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> are tetrachromatic and use four cone classes. Screening pigments, which narrow the spectrum of photoreceptors in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s and diurnal reptiles, render visual systems with four cone classes more efficient. To date, however, the question of tetrachromacy in shallow-water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> that, like humans, lack screening pigments, is still unsolved. We raise the possibility that tetrachromacy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> has evolved in response to higher spectral complexity of underwater light. We compared the dimensionality of colour vision in humans and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> by examining the spectral complexity of the colour signal reflected from objects into their eyes. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> require four to six cone classes to reconstruct the colour signal of aquatic objects at the accuracy level achieved by humans viewing terrestrial objects. This is because environmental light, which alters the colour signals, is more complex and contains more spectral fluctuations underwater than on land. We further show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> cones are better suited than human cones to detect these spectral fluctuations, suggesting that the capability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> cones to detect high-frequency fluctuations in the colour signal confers an advantage. Taken together, we propose that tetrachromacy in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> has evolved to enhance the reconstruction of complex colour signals in shallow aquatic environments. Of course, shallow-water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> might possess fewer than four cone classes; however, this would come with the inevitable loss in accuracy of signal reconstruction.</p>

Genome-Wide Development and Use of Microsatellite Markers for Large-Scale Genotyping Applications in Foxtail Millet [<i>Setaria italica</i> (L.)]
<p>The availability of well-validated informative co-dominant microsatellite markers and saturated genetic linkage map has been limited in foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> (<i>Setaria italica</i> L.). In view of this, we conducted a genome-wide analysis and identified 28 342 microsatellite repeat-motifs spanning 405.3 Mb of foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> genome. The trinucleotide repeats (∼48%) was prevalent when compared with dinucleotide repeats (∼46%). Of the 28 342 microsatellites, 21 294 (∼75%) primer pairs were successfully designed, and a total of 15 573 markers were physically mapped on 9 chromosomes of foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong>. About 159 markers were validated successfully in 8 accessions of <i>Setaria</i> sp. with ∼67% polymorphic potential. The high percentage (89.3%) of cross-genera transferability across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> and non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> species with higher transferability percentage in bioenergy grasses (∼79%, Switchgrass and ∼93%, Pearl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong>) signifies their importance in studying the bioenergy grasses. <i>In silico</i> comparative mapping of 15 573 foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> microsatellite markers against the mapping data of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sorghum</span></strong> (16.9%), maize (14.5%) and rice (6.4%) indicated syntenic relationships among the chromosomes of foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong> and target species. The results, thus, demonstrate the immense applicability of developed microsatellite markers in germplasm characterization, phylogenetics, construction of genetic linkage map for gene/quantitative trait loci discovery, comparative mapping in foxtail <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong>, including other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">millet</span></strong>s and bioenergy grass species.</p>

The olfactory neuron AWC promotes avoidance of normally palatable food following chronic dietary restriction
<p>Changes in metabolic state alter foraging behavior and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference in animals. Here, I show that normally attractive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> becomes repulsive to <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> if animals are chronically undernourished as a result of alimentary tract defects. This behavioral plasticity is achieved in two ways: increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> leaving and induction of aversive behavior towards <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>. A particularly strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoider is defective in the chitin synthase that makes the pharyngeal lining. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance induced by underfeeding is mediated by cGMP signaling in the olfactory neurons AWC and AWB, and the gustatory neurons ASJ and ASK. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance is enhanced by increased population density and is reduced if the animals are unable to correctly interpret their nutritional state as a result of defects in the AMP kinase or TOR/S6kinase pathways. The TGF-β/DBL-1 pathway suppresses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> avoidance and the cellular basis for this is distinct from its role in aversive olfactory learning of harmful <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>. This study suggests that nutritional state feedback via nutrient sensors, population size and olfactory neurons guides <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> preference in <i>C. elegans</i>.</p>

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

The whole-soil carbon flux in response to warming
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> organic carbon harbors three times as much carbon as Earth’s atmosphere, and its decomposition is a potentially large climate change feedback and major source of uncertainty in climate projections. The response of whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> profiles to warming has not been tested in situ. In a deep warming experiment in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>, we found that CO<sub>2</sub> production from all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> depths increased with 4°C warming; annual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> respiration increased by 34 to 37%. All depths responded to warming with similar temperature sensitivities, driven by decomposition of decadal-aged carbon. Whole-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> warming reveals a larger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> respiration response than many in situ experiments (most of which only warm the surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>) and models.</p>

Designing river flows to improve food security futures in the Lower Mekong Basin
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s provide unrivaled opportunity for clean energy via hydropower, but little is known about the potential impact of dam-building on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> security these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s provide. In tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s, rainfall drives a periodic flood pulse fueling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> production and delivering nutrition to more than 150 million people worldwide. Hydropower will modulate this flood pulse, thereby threatening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> security. We identified variance components of the Mekong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> flood pulse that predict yield in one of the largest freshwater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>eries in the world. We used these variance components to design an algorithm for a managed hydrograph to explore future yields. This algorithm mimics attributes of discharge variance that drive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>ery yield: prolonged low flows followed by a short flood pulse. Designed flows increased yield by a factor of 3.7 relative to historical hydrology. Managing desired components of discharge variance will lead to greater efficiency in the Lower Mekong Basin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> system.</p>

Long-term pattern and magnitude of soil carbon feedback to the climate system in a warming world
<p>In a 26-year <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> warming experiment in a mid-latitude hardwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>, we documented changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon cycling to investigate the potential consequences for the climate system. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> warming results in a four-phase pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> organic matter decay and carbon dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere, with phases of substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon loss alternating with phases of no detectable loss. Several factors combine to affect the timing, magnitude, and thermal acclimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon loss. These include depletion of microbially accessible carbon pools, reductions in microbial biomass, a shift in microbial carbon use efficiency, and changes in microbial community composition. Our results support projections of a long-term, self-reinforcing carbon feedback from mid-latitude <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s to the climate system as the world warms.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als and the control that the leaf exerts over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al deposit</span></strong>ion, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al distribution that is preserved in different environments. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (<i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>)
<p>Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical abilities are widespread among vertebrates. While experiments in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in <i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desert</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> were trained to receive a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not controlled for non-numerical continuous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli controlled for continuous quantities and half not controlled for continuous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cave<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> trained from the beginning only with stimuli controlled for continuous quantities proved able to learn the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> tested with visual stimuli.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong>). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

Tree Physiology
Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth correlations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

The impact of hunting on tropical mammal and bird populations
<p>Hunting is a major d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> of biodiversity loss, but a systematic large-scale estimate of hunting-induced defaunation is lacking. We synthesized 176 studies to quantify hunting-induced declines of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> populations across the tropics. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong> abundances declined by 58% (25 to 76%) and by 83% (72 to 90%) in hunted compared with unhunted areas. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong> populations were depleted within 7 and 40 kilometers from hunters’ access points (roads and settlements). Additionally, hunting pressure was higher in areas with better accessibility to major towns where wild meat could be traded. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong> population densities were lower outside protected areas, particularly because of commercial hunting. Strategies to sustainably manage wild meat hunting in both protected and unprotected tropical ecosystems are urgently needed to avoid further defaunation.</p>

The validity and reproducibility of cross table radiographs compared with CT scans for the measurement of anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and validity   of cross table radiographs for measuring the anteversion of the   acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to compare   it with measurements using CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 29 patients who underwent THA between June 2010 and   January 2016 were included. There were 17 men and 12 women. Their   mean age was 43 years (26 to 65). Seven patients underwent a bilateral   procedure. Thus, 36 THAs were included in the study. Lateral radiographs   and CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later. The anteversion of the acetabular component was   measured using the method described by Woo and Morrey and the ischiolateral   method described by Pulos et al and these were compared with the   results obtained from CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean anteversion was 18.35° (3° to 38°) using Woo and Morrey’s   method, 51.45° (30° to 85°) using the ischiolateral method and 21.22°   (2° to 48°) using CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s. The Pearson correlation coefficient   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method. There was a linear correlation between the measurements   using the ischiolateral method and those using CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong>s. We derived   a simple linear equation between the value of the CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong> and that   of ischiolateral method to deduce the CT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong> value from that of ischiolateral   method and <i>vice versa</i>. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anteversion of the acetabular component measured using both   plain radiographic methods was consistently valid with good interobserver   reproducibility, but the ischiolateral method which is independent   of pelvic tilt was more accurate. As CT is costly, associated with   a high dose of radiation and not readily available, the ischiolateral method   can be used for assessing the anteversion of the acetabular component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1006–11.</p></sec>

Shifting habitat mosaics and fish production across river basins
<p>Watersheds are complex mosaics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s whose conditions vary across space and time as landscape features filter overriding climate forcing, yet the extent to which the reliability of ecosystem services depends on these dynamics remains unknown. We quantified how shifting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong> mosaics are expressed across a range of spatial scales within a large, free-flowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>, and how they stabilize the production of Pacific salmon that support valuable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>eries. The strontium isotope records of ear stones (otoliths) show that the relative productivity of locations across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> network, as both natal- and juvenile-rearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>, varies widely among years and that this variability is expressed across a broad range of spatial scales, ultimately stabilizing the interannual production of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> at the scale of the entire basin.</p>

Cascading impacts of large-carnivore extirpation in an African ecosystem
<p>Populations of the world’s largest carnivores are declining and now occupy mere fractions of their historical ranges. Theory predicts that when apex predators disappear, large herbivores become less fearful, occupy new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s, and modify those <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">habitat</span></strong>s by eating new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> plants. Yet experimental support for this prediction has been difficult to obtain in large-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong> systems. After the extirpation of leopards and African wild dogs from Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>-dwelling antelopes [bushbuck (<i>Tragelaphus sylvaticus</i>)] expanded into treeless floodplains, where they consumed novel diets and suppressed a common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> plant [waterwort (<i>Bergia mossambicensis</i>)]. By experimentally simulating predation risk, we demonstrate that this behavior was reversible. Thus, whereas anthropogenic predator extinction disrupted a trophic cascade by enabling rapid differentiation of prey behavior, carnivore restoration may just as rapidly reestablish that cascade.</p>

Metabolic asymmetry and the global diversity of marine predators
<p>Species richness of marine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s is highest in cold, temperate seas—a conspicuous exception to the general latitudinal gradient of decreasing diversity from the tropics to the poles. We compiled a comprehensive dataset for 998 species of sharks, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>, reptiles, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>s, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s to identify and quantify inverse latitudinal gradients in diversity, and derived a theory to explain these patterns. We found that richness, phylogenetic diversity, and abundance of marine predators diverge systematically with thermoregulatory strategy and water temperature, reflecting metabolic differences between endotherms and ectotherms that drive trophic and competitive interactions. Spatial patterns of foraging support theoretical predictions, with total prey consumption by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>s increasing by a factor of 80 from the equator to the poles after controlling for productivity.</p>

Processed foods and food reward
<p>Signals that convey nutritional information from the gut to the brain regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> reinforcement and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">food</span></strong> choice (<i>1</i>–<i>4</i>).

Classifying drivers of global forest loss
<p>Global maps of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss depict the scale and magnitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent conversion (i.e., de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation) from temporary loss from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ry or wildfire. Using satellite imagery, we developed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> disturbance to the dominant d<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s of land cover and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land us</span></strong>e change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27% of global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss can be attributed to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation through permanent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land us</span></strong>e change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">land us</span></strong>e over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ry (26%), shifting agriculture (24%), and wildfire (23%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation has not declined. To end de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation, companies must eliminate 5 million hectares of conversion from supply chains each year.</p>

Global extent of rivers and streams
<p>The turbulent surfaces of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s and streams are natural hotspots of biogeochemical exchange with the atmosphere. At the global scale, the total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>-atmosphere flux of trace gasses such as carbon dioxide depends on the proportion of Earth’s surface that is covered by the fluvial network, yet the total surface area of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s and streams is poorly constrained. We used a global database of planform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> hydromorphology and a statistical approach to show that global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong> and stream surface area at mean annual discharge is 773,000 ± 79,000 square kilometers (0.58 ± 0.06%) of Earth’s nonglaciated land surface, an area 44 ± 15% larger than previous spatial estimates. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">river</span></strong>s and streams likely play a greater role in controlling land-atmosphere fluxes than is currently represented in global carbon budgets.</p>

Friction at the bed does not control fast glacier flow
<p>The largest uncertainty in the ice sheet models used to predict future sea level rise originates from our limited understanding of processes at the ice/bed interface. Near <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong> termini, where basal sliding controls ice flow, most predictive ice sheet models use a parameterization of sliding that has been theoretically derived for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong> flow over a hard bed. We find that this sliding relation does not apply to the 140 Greenland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong>s that we analyzed. There is no relationship between basal sliding and frictional stress at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong> bed, contrary to theoretical predictions. There is a strong relationship between sliding speed and net pressure at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong> bed. This latter finding is in agreement with earlier observations of mountain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glacier</span></strong>s that have been largely overlooked by the glaciological community.</p>

Tracking the global footprint of fisheries

A global atlas of the dominant bacteria found in soil

The extent of forest in dryland biomes
<p>Dryland biomes cover two-fifths of Earth’s land surface, but their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> area is poorly known. Here, we report an estimate of global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> extent in dryland biomes, based on analyzing more than 210,000 0.5-hectare sample plots through a photo-interpretation approach using large databases of satellite imagery at (i) very high spatial resolution and (ii) very high temporal resolution, which are available through the Google Earth platform. We show that in 2015, 1327 million hectares of drylands had more than 10% tree-cover, and 1079 million hectares comprised <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>. Our estimate is 40 to 47% higher than previous estimates, corresponding to 467 million hectares of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> that have never been reported before.

Plant-soil feedbacks and mycorrhizal type influence temperate forest population dynamics
<p>Feedback with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota is an important determinant of terrestrial plant diversity. However, the factors regulating plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedback, which varies from positive to negative among plant species, remain uncertain. In a large-scale study involving 55 species and 550 populations of North American trees, the type of mycorrhizal association explained much of the variation in plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedbacks. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> collected beneath conspecifics, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees experienced negative feedback, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees displayed positive feedback. Additionally, arbuscular mycorrhizal trees exhibited strong conspecific inhibition at multiple spatial scales, whereas ectomycorrhizal trees exhibited conspecific facilitation locally and less severe conspecific inhibition regionally. These results suggest that mycorrhizal type, through effects on plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedbacks, could be an important contributor to population regulation and community structure in temperate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s.</p>

Plant-soil feedback and the maintenance of diversity in Mediterranean-climate shrublands
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota influence plant performance through plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedback, but it is unclear whether the strength of such feedback depends on plant traits and whether plant-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> feedback drives local plant diversity. We grew 16 co-occurring plant species with contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies from hyperdiverse Australian shrublands and exposed them to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota from under their own or other plant species. Plant responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal plants and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal plants. Simulations revealed that such strategy-dependent feedback is sufficient to maintain the high taxonomic and functional diversity characterizing these Mediterranean-climate shrublands. Our study identifies nutrient-acquisition strategy as a key trait explaining how different plant responses to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> biota promote local plant diversity.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Genesis and Regulatory Wiring of Retroelement-Derived Domesticated Genes: A Phylogenomic Perspective
<p>Molecular domestications of transposable elements have occurred repeatedly during the evolution of eukaryotes. Vertebrates, especially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>s, possess numerous single copy domesticated genes (DGs) that have originated from the intronless multicopy transposable elements. However, the origin and evolution of the retroelement-derived DGs (RDDGs) that originated from Metaviridae has been only partially elucidated, due to absence of genome data or to limited analysis of a single family of DGs. We traced the genesis and regulatory wiring of the Metaviridae-derived DGs through phylogenomic analysis, using whole-genome information from more than 90 chordate genomes. Phylogenomic analysis of these DGs in chordate genomes provided direct evidence that major diversification has occurred in the ancestor of placental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>ian RDDGs have been shown to originate in several steps by independent domestication events and to diversify later by gene duplications. Analysis of syntenic loci has shown that diverse RDDGs and their chromosomal positions were fully established in the ancestor of placental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>s. By analysis of active Metaviridae lineages in amniotes, we have demonstrated that RDDGs originated from retroelement remains. The chromosomal gene movements of RDDGs were highly dynamic only in the ancestor of placental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>s. During the domestication process, de novo acquisition of regulatory regions is shown to be a prerequisite for the survival of the DGs. The origin and evolution of de novo acquired promoters and untranslated regions in diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>ian RDDGs have been explained by comparative analysis of orthologous gene loci. The origin of placental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>-specific innovations and adaptations, such as placenta and newly evolved brain functions, was most probably connected to the regulatory wiring of DGs and their rapid fixation in the ancestor of placental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>s.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cave<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>'s lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>'s distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>'s speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>'s gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>es: the mechanism of sensing water motion by the lateral line system and the mechanism of generating water motion by mouth suction.</p>

Claudin-6, -10d and -10e contribute to seawater acclimation in the euryhaline puffer fish <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i>
<p>Expression profiles of <i>claudin-6, -10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> in the euryhaline teleost <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> <i>Tetraodon nigroviridis</i> revealed <i>claudin-6</i> in brain, eye, gill and skin tissue, while <i>claudin-10d</i> and -<i>10e</i> were found in brain, gill and skin only. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>es, the gill and skin are important tissue barriers that interface directly with surrounding water, but these organs generally function differently in osmoregulation. Therefore, roles for gill and skin claudin-6, -10d and -10e in the osmoregulatory strategies of <i>T. nigroviridis</i> were investigated. In the gill epithelium, claudin-6, -10d and -10e co-localized with Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase immunoreactive (NKA-ir) ionocytes, and differences in sub-cellular localization could be observed in hypoosmotic (freshwater, FW) versus hyperosmotic (seawater, SW) environments. Claudin-10d and -10e abundance increased in the gills of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> acclimated to SW versus FW, while claudin-6 abundance decreased in the gills of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> acclimated to SW. Taken together with our knowledge of claudin-6 and -10 function in other vertebrates, data support the idea that in SW-acclimated <i>T. nigroviridis</i>, these claudins are abundant in gill ionocytes, where they contribute to the formation of a Na<sup>+</sup> shunt and ‘leaky’ epithelium, both of which are characteristic of salt-secreting SW <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> gills. Skin claudin-10d and -10e abundance also increased in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> acclimated to SW versus those in FW, but so did claudin-6. In skin, claudin-6 was found to co-localize with NKA-ir cells, but claudin-10d and -10e did not. This study provides direct evidence that the gill epithelium contains salinity-responsive tight junction proteins that are abundant primarily in ionocytes. These same proteins also appear to play a role in the osmoregulatory physiology of the epidermis.</p>

Acclimation of <i>Betula alleghaniensis</i> Britton to moderate soil water deficit: small morphological changes make for important consequences in crown display
<p>In the context of the predicted increasing frequency of summer droughts in the northeastern deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> of North America due to climate change, we investigated the acclimation capacity of yellow birch, an economically important native tree species, to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit. We carried out an integrated examination of allocation of biomass, leaf physiology, branching pattern and in situ 3D crown display. Potted seedlings were subjected to moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit for four consecutive months during their second growing season. Individuals under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit showed a 40% decrease in biomass accumulation but no change in the relative allocation of biomass to the different plant compartments. Net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates at leaf level decreased under water deficit (~15%) but could not alone explain the total reduction in growth, excluding the carbon starvation hypothesis. The observed reduction in net CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rates was related to a decrease in stomatal conductance and chlorophyll content. <i>STAR</i><sub>zen</sub> (in situ silhouette to total leaf area ratio; a proxy for light interception efficiency) decreased under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> water deficit due to shifts in biomass allocation within the branch compartment from long upper axes to short bottom axes. Despite the fact that the understanding of the processes involved in growth reduction and branching pattern alteration will need more attention in future research, we conclude that under water deficit yellow birch at young stages will: (i) experience a substantial loss of growth and biomass; and (ii) acclimate through architectural plasticity rather than through changes in the relative allocation of root biomass to enhance its water management.</p>

Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong>wood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> science community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, genetics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>e. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> sciences, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the availability of genetic and genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resourc</span></strong>es, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Pollen data and biome reconstructions show a diverging response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s to climate changes; the upper tree line was extremely unstable, shifting substantially in response to glacial-interglacial climate alternation, whereas the transition between the montane and lowland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s remained remarkably stable. Such ecological instability may have had a critical influence on species richness in the Afromontane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s.</p>

Fractal-like hierarchical organization of bone begins at the nanoscale
<p>The components of bone assemble hierarchically to provide stiffness and toughness. However, the organization and relationship between bone’s principal components—<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al and collagen—has not been clearly elucidated. Using three-dimensional electron tomography imaging and high-resolution two-dimensional electron microscopy, we demonstrate that bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al is hierarchically assembled beginning at the nanoscale: Needle-shaped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al units merge laterally to form platelets, and these are further organized into stacks of roughly parallel platelets. These stacks coalesce into aggregates that exceed the lateral dimensions of the collagen fibrils and span adjacent fibrils as continuous, cross-fibrillar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>alization. On the basis of these observations, we present a structural model of hierarchy and continuity for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al phase, which contributes to the structural integrity of bone.</p>

Protecting marine mammals, turtles, and birds by rebuilding global fisheries
<p>Reductions in global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>ing pressure are needed to end over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>ing of target species and maximize the value of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>eries. We ask whether such reductions would also be sufficient to protect non–target species threatened as bycatch. We compare changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>ing pressure needed to maximize profits from 4713 target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> stocks—accounting for >75% of global catch—to changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>ing pressure needed to reverse ongoing declines of 20 marine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>, sea turtle, and sea<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> populations threatened as bycatch. We project that maximizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>ery profits would halt or reverse declines of approximately half of these threatened populations. Recovering the other populations would require substantially greater effort reductions or targeting improvements. Improving commercial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong>ery management could thus yield important collateral benefits for threatened bycatch species globally.</p>

Sick birds don't fly…or do they?
<p>In 2014, a new, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) called H5N8 caused outbreaks in poultry in East and Southeast Asia and spread across the Northern Hemisphere to Europe and North America. In the United States alone, H5N8 outbreaks resulted in the destruction of more than 48 million poultry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s (<i>1</i>). International live-poultry trade and wild-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> migration have both been implicated in the intercontinental movement of H5N8 and other HPAIVs. H5N8 viruses have been found in wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>), but strong links between poultry outbreaks and live-poultry trade or wild-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> migration have been elusive. On page 213 of this issue, the Global Consortium for H5N8 and Related Influenza Viruses (<i>5</i>) delineates the contributions of live-poultry trade and wild-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong> migration to the global spread of H5N8 viruses.</p>

Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> is the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of carbon cycle–climate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon sink by 2100, yet the underlying carbon dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used <sup>14</sup>C data from 157 globally distributed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong> carbon by a factor of more than six (430 ± 50 years versus 3100 ± 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the carbon sequestration potential of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">soil</span></strong>s by a factor of nearly two (40 ± 27%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent carbon stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric carbon dioxide dynamics.</p>

Faster Decomposition Under Increased Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Limits Soil Carbon Storage

Semiautomated Feature Extraction from RGB Images for Sorghum Panicle Architecture GWAS
<p>Because structural variation in the inflorescence architecture of cereal crops can influence yield, it is of interest to identify the genes responsible for this variation. However, the manual collection of inflorescence phenotypes can be time consuming for the large populations needed to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and is difficult for multidimensional traits such as volume. A semiautomated phenotyping pipeline, TIM (Toolkit for Inflorescence Measurement), was developed and used to extract unidimensional and multidimensional features from images of 1,064 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sorghum</span></strong> (<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sorghum</span></strong> bicolor</i>) panicles from 272 genotypes comprising a subset of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sorghum</span></strong> Association Panel. GWAS detected 35 unique single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with variation in inflorescence architecture. The accuracy of the TIM pipeline is supported by the fact that several of these trait-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (TASs) are located within chromosomal regions associated with similar traits in previously published quantitative trait locus and GWAS analyses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sorghum</span></strong>. Additionally, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sorghum</span></strong> homologs of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes known to affect inflorescence architecture are enriched in the vicinities of TASs. Finally, our TASs are enriched within genomic regions that exhibit high levels of divergence between converted tropical lines and cultivars, consistent with the hypothesis that these chromosomal intervals were targets of selection during modern breeding.</p>

Recursive Paleohexaploidization Shaped the Durian Genome
<p>The durian (<i>Durio zibethinus</i>) genome has recently become available, and analysis of this genome reveals two paleopolyploidization events previously inferred as shared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> (<i>Gossypium</i> spp.). Here, we reanalyzed the durian genome in comparison with other well-characterized genomes. We found that durian and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> were actually affected by different polyploidization events: hexaploidization in durian ∼19–21 million years ago (mya) and decaploidization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> ∼13–14 mya. Previous interpretations of shared polyploidization events may have resulted from the elevated evolutionary rates in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> genes due to the decaploidization and insufficient consideration of the complexity of plant genomes. The decaploidization elevated evolutionary rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> genes by ∼64% compared to durian and explained a previous ∼4-fold over dating of the event. In contrast, the hexaploidization in durian did not prominently elevate gene evolutionary rates, likely due to its long generation time. Moreover, divergent evolutionary rates probably explain 98.4% of reconstructed phylogenetic trees of homologous genes being incongruent with expected topology. The findings provide further insight into the roles played by polypoidization in the evolution of genomes and genes, and they suggest revisiting existing reconstructed phylogenetic trees.</p>

Laccase GhLac1 Modulates Broad-Spectrum Biotic Stress Tolerance via Manipulating Phenylpropanoid Pathway and Jasmonic Acid Synthesis
<p>Plants are constantly challenged by a multitude of pathogens and pests, which causes massive yield and quality losses annually. A promising approach to reduce such losses is to enhance the immune system of plants through genetic engineering. Previous work has shown that laccases (p-diphenol:dioxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.10.3.2) function as lignin polymerization enzymes. Here we demonstrate that transgenic manipulation of the expression of the laccase gene <i>GhLac1</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) can confer an enhanced defense response to both pathogens and pests. Overexpression of <i>GhLac1</i> leads to increased lignification, associated with increased tolerance to the fungal pathogen <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> and to the insect pests <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> bollworm (<i>Helicoverpa armigera</i>) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> aphid (<i>Aphis gosypii</i>). Suppression of <i>GhLac1</i> expression leads to a redirection of metabolic flux in the phenylpropanoid pathway, causing the accumulation of JA and secondary metabolites that confer resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> bollworm; it also leads to increased susceptibility to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cotton</span></strong> aphid. Plant laccases therefore provide a new molecular tool to engineer pest and pathogen resistance in crops.</p>

Mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate in response to traumatic bone injury in the zebrafish fin and skull
<p>Zebra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> have an unlimited capacity to regenerate bone after fin amputation. In this process, mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate to osteogenic precursor cells and thus represent an important source of newly forming bone. By contrast, differentiated osteoblasts do not appear to contribute to repair of bone injuries in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>s; rather, osteoblasts form anew from mesenchymal stem cells. This raises the question whether osteoblast dedifferentiation is specific to appendage regeneration, a special feature of the lepidotrichia bone of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> fin, or a process found more generally in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> bone. Here, we show that dedifferentiation of mature osteoblasts is not restricted to fin regeneration after amputation, but also occurs during repair of zebra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> fin fractures and skull injuries. In both models, mature osteoblasts surrounding the injury downregulate the expression of differentiation markers, upregulate markers of the pre-osteoblast state and become proliferative. Making use of photoconvertible Kaede protein as well as Cre-driven genetic fate mapping, we show that osteoblasts migrate to the site of injury to replace damaged tissue. Our findings suggest a fundamental role for osteoblast dedifferentiation in reparative bone formation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> and indicate that adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fish</span></strong> osteoblasts display elevated cellular plasticity compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mammal</span></strong>ian bone-forming cells.</p>

Tropical forests are a net carbon source based on aboveground measurements of gain and loss
<p>The carbon balance of tropical ecosystems remains uncertain, with top-down atmospheric studies suggesting an overall sink and bottom-up ecological approaches indicating a modest net source.

This net release of carbon consists of losses of 861.7 ± 80.2 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup> and gains of 436.5 ± 31.0 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>. Gains result from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> growth; losses result from de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ation and from reductions in carbon density within standing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s (degradation or disturbance), with the latter accounting for 68.9% of overall losses.</p>

Extensive water ice within Ceres’ aqueously altered regolith: Evidence from nuclear spectroscopy
<p>The surface elemental composition of dwarf planet Ceres constrains its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regolith</span></strong> ice content, aqueous alteration processes, and interior evolution. Using nuclear spectroscopy data acquired by NASA’s Dawn mission, we determined the concentrations of elemental hydrogen, iron, and potassium on Ceres. The data show that surface materials were processed by the action of water within the interior. The non-icy portion of Ceres’ carbon-bearing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regolith</span></strong> contains similar amounts of hydrogen to those present in aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites; however, the concentration of iron on Ceres is lower than in the aforementioned chondrites. This allows for the possibility that Ceres experienced modest ice-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong> fractionation, resulting in differences between surface and bulk composition. At mid-to-high latitudes, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">regolith</span></strong> contains high concentrations of hydrogen, consistent with broad expanses of water ice, confirming theoretical predictions that ice can survive for billions of years just beneath the surface.</p>

New bird flu strain brings death and questions

The good news is that so far, it does not seem to infect humans. But its rapid spread and increasing deadliness to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s have mystified experts. And it underscores that avian influenza, once an occasional crisis, is now endemic in the burgeoning flocks of Asia, from which it periodically spreads in migrating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s.</p>

The formation of peak rings in large impact craters
<p>Large impacts provide a mechanism for resurfacing planets through mixing near-surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s with deeper material. Central peaks are formed from the dynamic uplift of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s during crater formation. As crater size increases, central peaks transition to peak rings. Without samples, debate surrounds the mechanics of peak-ring formation and their depth of origin. Chicxulub is the only known impact structure on Earth with an unequivocal peak ring, but it is buried and only accessible through drilling. Expedition 364 sampled the Chicxulub peak ring, which we found was formed from uplifted, fractured, shocked, felsic basement <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s. The peak-ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rock</span></strong>s are cross-cut by dikes and shear zones and have an unusually low density and seismic velocity. Large impacts therefore generate vertical fluxes and increase porosity in planetary crust.</p>

A selective insecticidal protein from <i>Pseudomonas</i> for controlling corn rootworms
<p>The coleopteran insect western <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corn</span></strong> rootworm (WCR) (<i>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</i> LeConte) is a devastating crop pest in North America and Europe. Although crop plants that produce <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (<i>Bt</i>) proteins can limit insect infestation, some insect populations have evolved resistance to <i>Bt</i> proteins. Here we describe an insecticidal protein, designated IPD072Aa, that is isolated from <i>Pseudomonas chlororaphis.</i> Transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corn</span></strong> plants expressing IPD072Aa show protection from WCR insect injury under field conditions. IPD072Aa leaves several lepidopteran and hemipteran insect species unaffected but is effective in killing WCR larvae that are resistant to <i>Bt</i> proteins produced by currently available transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corn</span></strong>. IPD072Aa can be used to protect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corn</span></strong> crops against WCRs.</p>

Ancient DNA reveals elephant birds and kiwi are sister taxa and clarifies ratite bird evolution
<p>The evolution of the ratite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s has been widely attributed to vicariant speciation, driven by the Cretaceous breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana. The early isolation of Africa and Madagascar implies that the ostrich and extinct Madaga<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scan</span></strong> elephant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s (Aepyornithidae) should be the oldest ratite lineages. We sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of two elephant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s and performed phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bird</span></strong>s are the closest relatives of the New Zealand kiwi and are distant from the basal ratite lineage of ostriches. This unexpected result strongly contradicts continental vicariance and instead supports flighted dispersal in all major ratite lineages. We suggest that convergence toward gigantism and flightlessness was facilitated by early Tertiary expansion into the diurnal herbivory niche after the extinction of the dinosaurs.</p>

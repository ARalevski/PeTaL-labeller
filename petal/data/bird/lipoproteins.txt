Generation of specific inhibitors of SUMO-1– and SUMO-2/3–mediated protein-protein interactions using Affimer (Adhiron) technology
<p>Because <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions underpin most biological processes, developing tools that target them to understand their function or to inform the development of therapeutics is an important task. SUMOylation is the posttranslational covalent attachment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the SUMO family (SUMO-1, SUMO-2, or SUMO-3), and it regulates numerous cellular pathways. SUMOylated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are recognized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with SUMO-interaction motifs (SIMs) that facilitate noncovalent interactions with SUMO. We describe the use of the Affimer system of peptide display for the rapid isolation of synthetic binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that inhibit SUMO-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions mediated by SIMs both in vitro and in cells. Crucially, these synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s did not prevent SUMO conjugation either in vitro or in cell-based systems, enabling the specific analysis of SUMO-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions. Furthermore, through structural analysis and molecular modeling, we explored the molecular mechanisms that may underlie their specificity in interfering with either SUMO-1–mediated interactions or interactions mediated by either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Not only will these reagents enable investigation of the biological roles of SUMOylation, but the Affimer technology used to generate these synthetic binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s could also be exploited to design or validate reagents or therapeutics that target other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions.</p>

Genomics and evolution of protein phosphatases
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases are the essential opposite to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases; together, these enzymes regulate all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation and most cellular processes. To better understand the global roles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation, we cataloged the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatome, composed of 189 known and predicted human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase genes. We also identified 79 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase pseudogenes or retrogenes, some of which may have residual function. We traced the origin and diversity of phosphatases by building <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatomes for eight other eukaryotes, from the protist <i>Dictyostelium</i> to the sea urchin. We classified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases from all nine species into a hierarchy of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> folds, 21 families, and 178 subfamilies. We found that >80% of the 101 human subfamilies were conserved across the animal kingdom, but show substantial differences in evolution, including losses and expansions of individual subfamilies and changes in accessory domains. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases show similar evolutionary dynamics to those of kinases, with substantial losses in major model organisms. Sequence analysis predicts that 26 human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase domains are catalytically disabled and that this disability is mostly conserved across orthologs. This genomic and evolutionary perspective on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases provides a framework for global analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation throughout the animal kingdom.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain amino acids or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and 131 to bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were identified in vivo, including three key nodule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s: sucrose synthase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and 18 bacterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

The G Protein <i>β</i>-Subunit, AGB1, Interacts with FERONIA in RALF1-Regulated Stomatal Movement
<p>Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are composed of Gα, G<i>β</i>, and Gγ subunits and function as molecular switches in signal transduction. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are one canonical Gα (GPA1), three extra-large Gα (XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3), one G<i>β</i> (AGB1), and three Gγ (AGG1, AGG2, and AGG3) subunits. To elucidate AGB1 molecular signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation using plasma membrane-enriched <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s followed by mass spectrometry to identify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactors of AGB1. After eliminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s present in the control immunoprecipitation, commonly identified contaminants, and organellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, a total of 103 candidate AGB1-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were confidently identified. We identified all of the G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> subunits except XLG1, receptor-like kinases, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, and 14-3-3-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, all of which may couple with or modulate G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling. We confirmed physical interaction between AGB1 and the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) family of polypeptides have been shown to be ligands of FER. In this study, we demonstrate that RALF1 regulates stomatal apertures and does so in a G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-dependent manner, inhibiting stomatal opening and promoting stomatal closure in Columbia but not in <i>agb1</i> mutants. We further show that AGGs and XLGs, but not GPA1, participate in RALF1-mediated stomatal signaling. Our results suggest that FER acts as a G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-coupled receptor for plant heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed coat mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s identified in mucilage include those previously identified by genetic analysis, and several mucilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> profiles except for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s include a family of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were detected in developing seed coats, and their expression requires seed coat differentiation regulators. TBA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s to the seed coat epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Tandem Fluorescent Protein Timers for Noninvasive Relative Protein Lifetime Measurement in Plants
<p>Targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation is an important and pervasive regulatory mechanism in plants, required for perception and response to the environment as well as developmental signaling. Despite the significance of this process, relatively few studies have assessed plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in a quantitative fashion. Tandem fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> timers (tFTs) offer a powerful approach for the assessment of in vivo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in distinct subcellular compartments of single or multiple cells. A tFT is a fusion of two different fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with distinct fluorophore maturation kinetics, which enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> age to be estimated from the ratio of fluorescence intensities of the two fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Here, we used short-lived auxin signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and model N-end rule (N-recognin) pathway reporters to demonstrate the utility of tFTs for studying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> turnover in living plant cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. We present transient expression of tFTs as an efficient screen for relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> lifetime, useful for testing the effects of mutations and different genetic backgrounds on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> stability. This work demonstrates the potential for using stably expressed tFTs to study native <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> dynamics with high temporal resolution in response to exogenous or endogenous stimuli.</p>

The Nonspecific Lipid Transfer Protein AtLtpI-4 Is Involved in Suberin Formation of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Crown Galls
<p>Nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s reversibly bind different types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> molecules in a hydrophobic cavity. They facilitate phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer between membranes in vitro, play a role in cuticle and possibly in suberin formation, and might be involved in plant pathogen defense signaling. This study focuses on the role of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> <i>AtLTPI-4</i> in crown gall development. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) crown gall tumors, which develop upon infection with the virulent <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> strain C58, highly expressed <i>AtLTPI-4</i>. Crown galls of the <i>atltpI-4</i> loss-of-function mutant were much smaller compared with those of wild-type plants. The gene expression pattern and localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> to the plasma membrane pointed to a function of AtLTPI-4 in cell wall suberization. Since Arabidopsis crown galls are covered by a suberin-containing periderm instead of a cuticle, we analyzed the suberin composition of crown galls and found a reduction in the amounts of long-chain fatty acids (C<sub>18:0</sub>) in the <i>atltpI-4</i> mutant. To demonstrate the impact of AtLtpI-4 on extracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, we expressed the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> in Arabidopsis epidermis cells. This led to a significant increase in the very-long-chain fatty acids C<sub>24</sub> and C<sub>26</sub> in the cuticular wax fraction. Homology modeling and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-overlay assays showed that AtLtpI-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> can bind these very-long-chain fatty acids. Thus, AtLtpI-4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> may facilitate the transfer of long-chain as well as very-long-chain fatty acids into the apoplast, depending on the cell type in which it is expressed. In crown galls, which endogenously express AtLtpI-4, it is involved in suberin formation.</p>

Bioenergetics through thick and thin
<p>The cells in all biological systems are composed of a limited number of molecular constituents, mainly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s.

In recent years, and with the advent of advanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>omics techniques, we have learned that “a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>” is simply not true, and that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition of membranes can have profound effects on the behavior and activity of its resident macromolecules. For example, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, such as members of the phosphatidylinositol family, are important signaling molecules. However, what is less appreciated is that the physical composition of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> membranes can have profound effects on cellular behavior as well. On page 1186 of this issue, Budin <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) use the Gram-negative bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i> and the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as model systems to show that the fluidity of a membrane, as determined by its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition, can have huge effects on the efficiency of aerobic energy production (respiration) by the highly hydrophobic, membrane-embedded, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system.</p>

Structure Annotation and Quantification of Wheat Seed Oxidized Lipids by High-Resolution LC-MS/MS
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> oxidation is a process ubiquitous in life, but the direct and comprehensive analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s has been limited by available analytical methods. We applied high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to quantify oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s (glycerides, fatty acids, phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, lysophospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, and galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s) and implemented a platform-independent high-throughput-amenable analysis pipeline for the high-confidence annotation and acyl composition analysis of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> contents of 90 different naturally aged wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) seed stocks were quantified in an untargeted high-resolution LC-MS experiment, resulting in 18,556 quantitative mass-to-charge ratio features. In a posthoc liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-resolution MS/MS spectra (5 mD accuracy) were recorded for 8,957 out of 12,080 putatively monoisotopic features of the LC-MS data set. A total of 353 nonoxidized and 559 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s with up to four additional oxygen atoms were annotated based on the accurate mass recordings (1.5 ppm tolerance) of the LC-MS data set and filtering procedures. MS/MS spectra available for 828 of these annotations were analyzed by translating experimentally known fragmentation rules of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s into the fragmentation of oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. This led to the identification of 259 nonoxidized and 365 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s by both accurate mass and MS/MS spectra and to the determination of acyl compositions for 221 nonoxidized and 295 oxidized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s.

Saltational evolution of the heterotrimeric G protein signaling mechanisms in the plant kingdom
<p>Signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s evolved diverse interactions to provide specificity for distinct stimuli. Signaling complexity in the G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> (heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate–binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>) network was achieved in animals through subunit duplication and incremental evolution. By combining comprehensive and quantitative phenotypic profiles of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> evolution informatics, we found that plant heterotrimeric G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> machinery evolved by a saltational (jumping) process. Sequence similarity scores mapped onto tertiary structures, and biochemical validation showed that the extra-large Gα (XLG) subunit evolved extensively in the charophycean algae (an aquatic green plant) by gene duplication and gene fusion. In terrestrial plants, further evolution uncoupled XLG from its negative regulator, regulator of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling, but preserved an α-helix region that enables interaction with its partner Gβγ. The ancestral gene evolved slowly due to the molecular constraints imposed by the need for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> to maintain interactions with various partners, whereas the genes encoding XLG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s evolved rapidly to produce three highly divergent members. Analysis of <i>A. thaliana</i> mutants indicated that these Gα and XLG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s all function with Gβγ and evolved to operate both independently and cooperatively. The XLG-Gβγ machinery specialized in environmental stress responses, whereas the canonical Gα-Gβγ retained developmental roles. Some developmental processes, such as shoot development, involve both Gα and XLG acting cooperatively or antagonistically. These extensive and rapid evolutionary changes in XLG structure compared to those of the canonical Gα subunit contrast with the accepted notion of how pathway diversification occurs through gene duplication with subsequent incremental coevolution of residues among interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Gene expression kinetics governs stimulus-specific decoration of the <i>Salmonella</i> outer membrane
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is the innermost component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules that occupy the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A is recognized by the host immune system and targeted by cationic antimicrobial compounds. In <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium, the phosphates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A are chemically modified by enzymes encoded by targets of the transcriptional regulator PmrA. These modifications increase resistance to the cationic peptide antibiotic polymyxin B by reducing the negative charge of the LPS. We report the mechanism by which <i>Salmonella</i> produces different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A profiles when PmrA is activated by low Mg<sup>2+</sup> versus a mildly acidic pH. Low Mg<sup>2+</sup> favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with 4-amino-4-deoxy-<sc>l</sc>-aminoarabinose (<sc>l</sc>-Ara4N) by activating the regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> PhoP, which initially increased the LPS negative charge by promoting transcription of <i>lpxT</i>, encoding an enzyme that adds an additional phosphate group to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A. Later, PhoP activated PmrA posttranslationally, resulting in expression of PmrA-activated genes, including those encoding the LpxT inhibitor PmrR and enzymes responsible for the incorporation of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N. By contrast, a mildly acidic pH favored modification of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates with a mixture of <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N and phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) by simultaneously inducing the PhoP-activated <i>lpxT</i> and PmrA-activated <i>pmrR</i> genes. Although <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N reduces the LPS negative charge more than does pEtN, modification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A phosphates solely with <sc>l</sc>-Ara4N required a prior transient increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> A negative charge.

Multisite phosphorylation by MAPK
<p>Reversible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphorylation plays a fundamental role in signal transduction networks. Phosphorylation alters <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function by regulating enzymatic activity, stability, cellular localization, or binding partners. Over three-quarters of human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s may be phosphorylated, with many targeted at multiple sites. Such multisite phosphorylation substantially increases the scope for modulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function—a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> with <i>n</i> phosphorylation sites has the potential to exist in 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> distinct phosphorylation states, each of which could, in theory, display modified functionality. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s can be substrates for several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases, thereby integrating distinct signals to provide a coherent biological response. However, they can also be phosphorylated at multiple sites by a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase to promote a specific functional output that can be reversed by dephosphorylation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatases. On page 233 of this issue, Mylona <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal an unexpected role for multisite phosphorylation, whereby a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase progressively phosphorylates sites on a transcription factor to promote and then subsequently limit its activity independently of dephosphorylation.</p>

Direct Proteomic Quantification of the Secretome of Activated Immune Cells
<sec><title>Tracking Secreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s secreted by cells provide a flow of information within tissues and are thus of particular interest. However, systematic detection of secreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s is tricky because they tend to be present in small amounts within complex mixtures of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s where other components are very abundant. <bold>Meissner <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 475) developed a method for screening the secreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s from cultured mouse macrophages in response to cues that cause inflammation. The amount of contaminating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s was reduced by culturing the cells without added serum and then sensitive mass spectrometry techniques were used to detect and quantify secretion of nearly 800 different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Secretion was compared from cells lacking the signaling adaptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s MyD88 or TRIF, or both. Secretion of some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were regulated redundantly and were secreted without one of the adaptors, but others required both signals for release. Some anti-inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were released at later times in response to synergistic signals from both adaptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, perhaps as a fail-safe mechanism to prevent excessive inflammation.</p></sec>

Stable Accumulation of Photosystem II Requires ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) of the Light Harvesting-Like Family
<p>The cellular functions of two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) one-helix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, OHP1 and OHP2 (also named LIGHT-HARVESTING-LIKE2 [LIL2] and LIL6, respectively, because they have sequence similarity to light-harvesting chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i>-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s), remain unclear. Tagged null mutants of <i>OHP1</i> and <i>OHP2</i> (<i>ohp1</i> and <i>ohp2</i>) showed stunted growth with pale-green leaves on agar plates, and these mutants were unable to grow on soil. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and the composition of thylakoid membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s revealed that <i>ohp1</i> deletion substantially affected photosystem II (PSII) core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> function and led to reduced levels of photosystem I core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s; however, it did not affect LHC accumulation. Transgenic <i>ohp1</i> plants rescued with OHP1-HA or OHP1-Myc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s developed a normal phenotype. Using these tagged OHP1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in transgenic plants, we localized OHP1 to thylakoid membranes, where it formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complexes with both OHP2 and High Chlorophyll Fluorescence244 (HCF244). We also found PSII core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s D1/D2, HCF136, and HCF173 and a few other plant-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s associated with the OHP1/OHP2-HCF244 complex, suggesting that these complexes are early intermediates in PSII assembly. OHP1 interacted directly with HCF244 in the complex. Therefore, OHP1 and HCF244 play important roles in the stable accumulation of PSII.</p>

Prolines in Transit Peptides Are Crucial for Efficient Preprotein Translocation into Chloroplasts
<p>Chloroplasts import many pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that can be classified based on their physicochemical properties. The cleavable N-terminal transit peptide (TP) of chloroplast pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s contains all the information required for import into chloroplasts through Toc/Tic translocons. The question of whether and how the physicochemical properties of pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s affect TP-mediated import into chloroplasts has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence that Pro residues in TP mediate efficient translocation through the chloroplast envelope membranes for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s containing transmembrane domains (TMDs) or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s prone to aggregation. By contrast, the translocation of soluble <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s through the chloroplast envelope membranes is less dependent on TP prolines. Proless TPs failed to mediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation into chloroplasts; instead, these mutant TPs led to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> mistargeting to the chloroplast envelope membranes or nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> aggregation during import into chloroplasts. The mistargeting of TMD-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s caused by Pro-less TPs in wild-type protoplasts was mimicked by wild-type TPs in <i>hsp93-V</i> protoplasts, in which pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation is compromised. We propose that the physicochemical properties of chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> translocation through the chloroplast envelope, and prolines in TP have a crucial role in the efficient translocation of TMD-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

LIL3, a Light-Harvesting Complex Protein, Links Terpenoid and Tetrapyrrole Biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The LIL3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) belongs to the light-harvesting complex (LHC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> family, which also includes the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s of photosystems I and II, the early-light-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, PsbS involved in nonphotochemical quenching, and the one-helix <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and their cyanobacterial homologs designated high-light-inducible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Each member of this family is characterized by one or two LHC transmembrane domains (referred to as the LHC motif) to which potential functions such as chlorophyll binding, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction, and integration of interacting partners into the plastid membranes have been attributed. Initially, LIL3 was shown to interact with geranylgeranyl reductase (CHLP), an enzyme of terpene biosynthesis that supplies the hydrocarbon chain for chlorophyll and tocopherol. Here, we show another function of LIL3 for the stability of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction analyses suggest the direct physical interaction of LIL3 with POR but not with chlorophyll synthase. Consistently, LIL3-deficient plants exhibit substantial loss of POR as well as CHLP, which is not due to defective transcription of the POR and CHLP genes but to the posttranslational modification of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> products. Interestingly, in vitro biochemical analyses provide novel evidence that LIL3 shows high binding affinity to protochlorophyllide, the substrate of POR. Taken together, this study suggests a critical role for LIL3 in the organization of later steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis. We suggest that LIL3 associates with POR and CHLP and thus contributes to the supply of the two metabolites, chlorophyllide and phytyl pyrophosphate, required for the final step in chlorophyll <i>a</i> synthesis.</p>

Functional Analysis of Cellulose Synthase (CESA) Protein Class Specificity
<p>The cellulose synthase complex (CSC) exhibits a 6-fold symmetry and is known as a “rosette.” Each CSC is believed to contain between 18 and 24 CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that each synthesize an individual glucan chain. These chains form the microfibrils that confer the remarkable structural properties of cellulose. At least three different classes of CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are essential to form the CSC. However, while organization of the CSC determines microfibril structure, how individual CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are organized within the CSC remains unclear. Parts of the plant CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s map sufficiently well onto the bacterial CESA (BcsA) structure, indicating that they are likely to share a common catalytic mechanism. However, plant CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are much larger than the bacterial BcsA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, prompting the suggestion that these plant-specific regions are important for interactions between CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and for conferring CESA class specificity. In this study, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of well-defined regions of secondary cell wall CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, with the aim of defining what distinguishes different CESA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and hence what determines the specificity of each CESA class. Our results demonstrate that CESA class specificity extends throughout the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> and not just in the highly variable regions. Furthermore, we find that different CESA isoforms vary greatly in their levels of site specificity and this is likely to be determined by the constraints imposed by their position within the CSC rather than their primary structure.</p>

Proximity biotinylation identifies a set of conformation-specific interactions between Merlin and cell junction proteins
<p>Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an inherited, neoplastic disease associated with schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas and that is caused by inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene <i>NF2</i>. The <i>NF2</i> gene product, Merlin, has no intrinsic catalytic activity; its tumor suppressor function is mediated through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with which it interacts. We used proximity biotinylation followed by mass spectrometry and direct binding assays to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that associated with wild-type and various mutant forms of Merlin in immortalized Schwann cells. We defined a set of 52 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in close proximity to wild-type Merlin. Most of the Merlin-proximal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s were components of cell junctional signaling complexes, suggesting that additional potential interaction partners may exist in adherens junctions, tight junctions, and focal adhesions. With mutant forms of Merlin that cannot bind to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) or that constitutively adopt a closed conformation, we confirmed a critical role for PIP<sub>2</sub> binding in Merlin function and identified a large cohort of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that specifically interacted with Merlin in the closed conformation. Among these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, we identified a previously unreported Merlin-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, apoptosis-stimulated p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 2 (ASPP2, also called Tp53bp2), that bound to closed-conformation Merlin predominately through the FERM domain. Our results demonstrate that Merlin is a component of cell junctional mechanosensing complexes and defines a specific set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s through which it acts.</p>

“Disruptor” residues in the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) R12 subfamily attenuate the inactivation of Gα subunits
<p>Understanding the molecular basis of interaction specificity between RGS (regulator of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and heterotrimeric (αβγ) G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s would enable the manipulation of RGS-G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions, explore their functions, and effectively target them therapeutically. RGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are classified into four subfamilies (R4, R7, RZ, and R12) and function as negative regulators of G <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> signaling by inactivating Gα subunits. We found that the R12 subfamily members RGS10 and RGS14 had lower activity than most R4 subfamily members toward the G<sub>i</sub> subfamily member Gα<sub>o</sub>. Using structure-based energy calculations with multiple Gα-RGS complexes, we identified R12-specific residues in positions that are predicted to determine the divergent activity of this subfamily. This analysis predicted that these residues, which we call “disruptor residues,” interact with the Gα helical domain. We engineered the R12 disruptor residues into the RGS domains of the high-activity R4 subfamily and found that these altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s exhibited reduced activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Reciprocally, replacing the putative disruptor residues in RGS18 (a member of the R4 subfamily that exhibited low activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>) with the corresponding residues from a high-activity R4 subfamily RGS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> increased its activity toward Gα<sub>o</sub>. Furthermore, the high activity of the R4 subfamily toward Gα<sub>o</sub> was independent of the residues in the homologous positions to the R12 subfamily and RGS18 disruptor residues. Thus, our results suggest that the identified RGS disruptor residues function as negative design elements that attenuate RGS activity for specific Gα <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s.</p>

Aurora B opposes PP1 function in mitosis by phosphorylating the conserved PP1-binding RVxF motif in PP1 regulatory proteins
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a highly conserved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> phosphatase that performs most of the serine- and threonine-dephosphorylation reactions in eukaryotes and opposes the actions of a diverse set of serine and threonine (Ser-Thr) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinases. PP1 gains substrate specificity through binding to a large number (>200) of regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that control PP1 localization, activity, and interactions with substrates. PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF binding motif that is present in many of these regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes. We showed that a subset of the RVxF binding motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable amino acid (RV[S/T]F), was phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily governed by the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites maintained the phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis by disrupting the assembly of PP1 holoenzymes. We generated an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s (KNL1, CDCA2, and RIF1) and multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that could potentially act as PP1 binding partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1, and ELYS) governed by this mechanism. Together, these data suggest a general regulatory mechanism by which the coordinated activities of Aurora B and PP1 control mitotic progression.</p>

Random heteropolymers preserve protein function in foreign environments

On the basis of an analysis of trends in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> sequences and characteristic chemical patterns on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> surfaces, we designed four-monomer random heteropolymers to mimic intrinsically disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> solubilization and stabilization in non-native environments.

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s fold into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding.

We combined computational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo designed mini<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, 1000 natural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences.

HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation
<p>Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is coproduced with ethylene in plant cells and is primarily enzymatically detoxified by the mitochondrial β-CYANOALANINE SYNTHASE (CAS-C1). Permanent or transient depletion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alterations in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> content, identifying 451 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that are absent or less abundant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that are only present or more abundant in <i>cas-c1</i>. Gene ontology classification of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s identified proteomic changes that explain the root hairless phenotype and the altered immune response observed in the <i>cas-c1</i> mutant. The mechanism of action of cyanide as a signaling molecule was addressed using two proteomic approaches aimed at identifying the <i>S-</i>cyanylation of Cys as a posttranslational modification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Both the 2-imino-thiazolidine chemical method and the direct untargeted analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified a set of 163 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s susceptible to <i>S-</i>cyanylation that included SEDOHEPTULOSE 1,7-BISPHOSPHATASE (SBPase), the PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE 20-3 (CYP20-3), and ENOLASE2 (ENO2). In vitro analysis of these enzymes showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation of SBPase Cys<sup>74</sup>, CYP20-3 Cys<sup>259</sup>, and ENO2 Cys<sup>346</sup> residues affected their enzymatic activity. Gene Ontology classification and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interaction cluster analysis showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation is involved in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, and the Calvin and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met cycles.</p>

Revisiting the Algal “Chloroplast Lipid Droplet”: The Absence of an Entity That Is Unlikely to Exist
<p>The precise localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets and the metabolic pathways associated with oil production are crucial to the engineering of microalgae for biofuel production. Several studies have reported detecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets within the chloroplast of the microalga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, which accumulates considerable amounts of triacylglycerol and starch within the cell under nitrogen deprivation or high-light stress conditions. Starch undoubtedly accumulates within the chloroplast, but there have been debates on the localization of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets, which are cytosolic organelles in other organisms. Although it is impossible to prove an absence, we tried to repeat experiments that previously indicated the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets in chloroplasts. Here, we present microscopic results showing no evidence for the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets within the chloroplast stroma, even though some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets existed in close association with the chloroplast or were largely engulfed by the chloroplasts. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets are cytosolic structures, distinct from the plastoglobules present in the chloroplast stroma. These results not only contrast with the old ideas but also point out that what were previously thought to be chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplets are likely to be embedded within chloroplast invaginations in association with the outer envelope of the chloroplast without intervention of the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings point to the intriguing possibility of a tight metabolic flow from the chloroplast to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> droplet through a close association rather than direct contact of both organelles.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis in oil seeds is still not fully understood. Oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial distribution of two major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species distribution was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> distribution profiles observed imply differential regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oilseed rape productivity and quality.</p>

Glycerolipid Characterization and Nutrient Deprivation-Associated Changes in the Green Picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i>
<p>The picoalga <i>Ostreococcus tauri</i> is a minimal photosynthetic eukaryote that has been used as a model system. <i>O. tauri</i> is known to efficiently produce docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We provide a comprehensive study of the glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>ome of <i>O. tauri</i> and validate this species as model for related picoeukaryotes. <i>O. tauri</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s displayed unique features that combined traits from the green and the chromalveolate lineages. The betaine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> diacylglyceryl-hydroxymethyl-trimethyl-β-alanine and phosphatidyldimethylpropanethiol, both hallmarks of chromalveolates, were identified as presumed extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. DHA was confined to these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, while plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s of prokaryotic type were characterized by the overwhelming presence of ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs), 18:5 being restricted to galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. C16:4, an FA typical of green microalgae galacto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, also was a major component of <i>O. tauri</i> extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, while the 16:4-coenzyme A (CoA) species was not detected. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) displayed the complete panel of FAs, and many species exhibited combinations of FAs diagnostic for plastidial and extraplastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s. Importantly, under nutrient deprivation, 16:4 and ω-3 C18 polyunsaturated FAs accumulated into de novo synthesized TAGs while DHA-TAG species remained rather stable, indicating an increased contribution of FAs of plastidial origin to TAG synthesis. Nutrient deprivation further severely down-regulated the conversion of 18:3 to 18:4, resulting in obvious inversion of the 18:3/18:4 ratio in plastidial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, TAGs, as well as acyl-CoAs. The fine-tuned and dynamic regulation of the 18:3/18:4 ratio suggested an important physiological role of these FAs in photosynthetic membranes. Acyl position in structural and storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s together with acyl-CoA analysis further help to determine mechanisms possibly involved in glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> synthesis.</p>

Thermal proximity coaggregation for system-wide profiling of protein complex dynamics in cells
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s differentially interact with each other across cellular states and conditions, but an efficient proteome-wide strategy to monitor them is lacking. We report the application of thermal proximity coaggregation (TPCA) for high-throughput intracellular monitoring of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complex dynamics. Significant TPCA signatures observed among well-validated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> interactions correlate positively with interaction stoichiometry and are statistically observable in more than 350 annotated human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complexes. Using TPCA, we identified many complexes without detectable differential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> expression, including chromatin-associated complexes, modulated in S phase of the cell cycle. Comparison of six cell lines by TPCA revealed cell-specific interactions even in fundamental cellular processes. TPCA constitutes an approach for system-wide studies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complexes in nonengineered cells and tissues and might be used to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complexes that are modulated in diseases.</p>

Protein structure determination using metagenome sequence data

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Modulating Protein Stability to Switch Toxic Protein Function On and Off in Living Cells
<p>Toxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are prime targets for molecular farming (the generation of pharmacologically active or biotechnologically usable compounds in plants) and are also efficient tools for targeted cell ablation in genetics, developmental biology, and biotechnology. However, achieving conditional activity of cytotoxins and maintaining the toxin-expressing plants as stably transformed lines remain challenging. Here, we produce a switchable version of the highly cytotoxic bacterial RNase barnase by fusing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> to a portable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation cassette, the low-temperature degron cassette. This method allows conditional genetics based on conditional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> degradation via the N-end rule or N-degron pathway and has been used to vice versa accumulate and/or deplete a diverse variety of highly active, unstable or stable target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in different living multicellular organisms and cell systems. Moreover, we expressed the barnase fusion under control of the trichome-specific <i>TRIPTYCHON</i> promoter. This enabled efficient temperature-dependent control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> accumulation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf hairs (trichomes). By tuning the levels of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, we were able to control the fate of trichomes in vivo. The on-demand formation of trichomes through manipulating the balance between stabilization and destabilization of barnase provides proof of concept for a robust and powerful tool for conditional switchable cell arrest. We present this tool as a potential strategy for the manufacture and accumulation of cytotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and toxic high-value products in plants or for conditional genetic cell ablation.</p>

CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED Supports Translation under Stress and Interacts with the Ribosomal 30S Subunit
<p>Chloroplast ribosomes, which originated from cyanobacteria, comprise a large subunit (50S) and a small subunit (30S) containing ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and various ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Genes for many chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with auxiliary roles in ribosome biogenesis or functioning, reside in the nucleus. Here, we identified Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CHLOROPLAST RIBOSOME ASSOCIATED (CRASS), a member of the latter class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, based on the tight coexpression of its mRNA with transcripts for nucleus-encoded chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. CRASS was acquired during the evolution of embryophytes and is localized to the chloroplast stroma. Loss of CRASS results in minor defects in development, photosynthetic efficiency, and chloroplast translation activity under controlled growth conditions, but these phenotypes are greatly exacerbated under stress conditions induced by the translational inhibitors lincomycin and chloramphenicol or by cold treatment. The CRASS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> comigrates with chloroplast ribosomal particles and coimmunoprecipitates with the 16S rRNA and several chloroplast ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, particularly the plastid ribosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s of the 30S subunit (PRPS1 and PRPS5). The association of CRASS with PRPS1 and PRPS5 is independent of rRNA and is not detectable in yeast two-hybrid experiments, implying that either CRASS interacts indirectly with PRPS1 and PRPS5 via another component of the small ribosomal subunit or that it recognizes structural features of the multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>/rRNA particle. CRASS plays a role in the biogenesis and/or stability of the chloroplast ribosome that becomes critical under certain stressful conditions when ribosomal activity is compromised.</p>

<i>Medicago</i> Plants Control Nodulation by Regulating Proteolysis of the Receptor-Like Kinase DMI2
<p>Plants use receptor-like kinases to monitor environmental changes and transduce signals into plant cells. The <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (hereafter <i>M</i>. <i>truncatula</i>) DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS2 (DMI2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> functions as a coreceptor of rhizobial signals to initiate nodule development and rhizobial infection during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, but the mechanisms regulating DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> level and folding are still unknown. Here, we report that DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> abundance changes during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. DMI2 accumulates in the nodules and is induced by rhizobia treatment through a posttranscriptional process. However, DMI2 induction is independent of the perception of Nod factor, a group of lipochitooligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia. The stability of the DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> is controlled by the proteasome pathway: in rhizobia-free environments, DMI2 is degraded by the proteasome, but during rhizobial infection, DMI2 is protected from the proteasome, resulting in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> accumulation. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor-promoted accumulation of DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> in <i>Medicago</i> roots induces the expression of two early nodulation marker genes, supporting the hypothesis that DMI2 accumulation activates downstream symbiosis signaling. The extracellular region of DMI2 contains two malectin-like domains (MLDs) and a leucine-rich repeat. When conserved amino acids in the MLDs are mutated, DMI2 fails to restore nodule development in <i>dmi2</i> mutants, and point-mutated MLD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are degraded constitutively, suggesting that the MLD may be vital for the accumulation of DMI2. Our findings suggest that legumes control nodule development through modulating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> level of DMI2, revealing a layer of regulation in the interaction between plants and rhizobia in nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.</p>

PROHIBITIN3 Forms Complexes with ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 to Regulate Stress-Induced Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a major defense signal in plants. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the chloroplast-localized isochorismate pathway is the main source of SA biosynthesis during abiotic stress or pathogen infections. In the first step of the pathway, the enzyme ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 (ICS1) converts chorismate to isochorismate. An unknown enzyme subsequently converts isochorismate to SA. Here, we show that ICS1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels increase during UV-C stress. To identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that may play roles in SA production by regulating ICS1, we analyzed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that coimmunoprecipitated with ICS1 via mass spectrometry. The ICS1 complexes contained a large number of peptides from the PROHIBITIN (PHB) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> family, with PHB3 the most abundant. PHB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s have diverse biological functions that include acting as scaffolds for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> complex formation and stabilization. PHB3 was reported previously to localize to mitochondria. Using fractionation, protease protection, and live imaging, we show that PHB3 also localizes to chloroplasts, where ICS1 resides. Notably, loss of PHB3 function led to decreased ICS1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels in response to UV-C stress. However, <i>ICS1</i> transcript levels remain unchanged, indicating that ICS1 is regulated posttranscriptionally. The <i>phb3</i> mutant displayed reduced levels of SA, the SA-regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> PR1, and hypersensitive cell death in response to UV-C and avirulent strains of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and, correspondingly, supported increased growth of <i>P. syringae</i>. The expression of a <i>PHB3</i> transgene in the <i>phb3</i> mutant complemented all of these phenotypes. We suggest a model in which the formation of PHB3-ICS1 complexes stabilizes ICS1 to promote SA production in response to stress.</p>

The Prenylated Rab GTPase Receptor PRA1.F4 Contributes to Protein Exit from the Golgi Apparatus
<p>Prenylated Rab acceptor1 (PRA1) functions in the recruitment of prenylated Rab <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s to their cognate organelles. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains a large number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s belonging to the AtPRA1 family. However, their physiological roles remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the physiological role of AtPRA1.F4, a member of the AtPRA1 family. A T-DNA insertion knockdown mutant of <i>AtPRA1.F4</i>, <i>atpra1.f4</i>, was smaller in stature than parent plants and possessed shorter roots, whereas transgenic plants overexpressing HA:AtPRA1.F4 showed enhanced development of secondary roots and root hairs. However, both overexpression and knockdown plants exhibited increased sensitivity to high-salt stress, lower vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and plasma membrane ATPase activities, lower and higher pH in the vacuole and apoplast, respectively, and highly vesiculated Golgi apparatus. HA:AtPRA1.F4 localized to the Golgi apparatus and assembled into high-molecular-weight complexes. <i>atpra1.f4</i> plants displayed a defect in vacuolar trafficking, which was complemented by low but not high levels of <i>HA</i>:<i>AtPRA1.F4</i>. Overexpression of HA:AtPRA1.F4 also inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> trafficking at the Golgi apparatus, albeit differentially depending on the final destination or type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>: trafficking of vacuolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, plasma membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, and trans-Golgi network (TGN)-localized SYP61 was strongly inhibited; trafficking of TGN-localized SYP51 was slightly inhibited; and trafficking of secretory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s and TGN-localized SYP41 was negligibly or not significantly inhibited. Based on these results, we propose that Golgi-localized AtPRA1.F4 is involved in the exit of many but not all types of post-Golgi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s from the Golgi apparatus. Additionally, an appropriate level of AtPRA1.F4 is crucial for its function at the Golgi apparatus.</p>

Pipeline to Identify Hydroxyproline-Rich Glycoproteins
<p>Intrinsically disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s (IDPs) are functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure. The study of IDPs is a rapidly growing area as the crucial biological functions of more of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are uncovered. In plants, IDPs are implicated in plant stress responses, signaling, and regulatory processes. A superfamily of cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, the hydroxyproline-rich glyco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s (HRGPs), have characteristic features of IDPs. Their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> backbones are rich in the disordering amino acid proline, they contain repeated sequence motifs and extensive posttranslational modifications (glycosylation), and they have been implicated in many biological functions. HRGPs are evolutionarily ancient, having been isolated from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-rich walls of chlorophyte algae to the cellulose-rich walls of embryophytes. Examination of HRGPs in a range of plant species should provide valuable insights into how they have evolved. Commonly divided into the arabinogalactan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, extensins, and proline-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, in reality, a continuum of structures exists within this diverse and heterogenous superfamily. An inability to accurately classify HRGPs leads to inconsistent gene ontologies limiting the identification of HRGP classes in existing and emerging omics data sets. We present a novel and robust motif and amino acid bias (MAAB) bioinformatics pipeline to classify HRGPs into 23 descriptive subclasses. Validation of MAAB was achieved using available genomic resources and then applied to the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (<ext-link>www.onekp.com</ext-link>) data set. Significant improvement in the detection of HRGPs using multiple-<i>k-</i>mer transcriptome assembly methodology was observed. The MAAB pipeline is readily adaptable and can be modified to optimize the recovery of IDPs from other organisms.</p>

Membrane Proteomic Insights into the Physiology and Taxonomy of an Oleaginous Green Microalga

Using an RNA sequencing-based proteomics approach together with manual annotation, we are able to provide, to our knowledge, the first membrane proteome of an oleaginous microalga. This approach allowed the identification of novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in <i>E. oleoabundans</i>, including two photoprotection-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, Photosystem II Subunit S and Maintenance of Photosystem II under High Light1, which were considered exclusive to higher photosynthetic organisms, as well as Retinitis Pigmentosa Type 2-Clathrin Light Chain, a membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> with a novel domain architecture. Free-flow zonal electrophoresis of microalgal membranes coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry proved to be a useful technique for determining the intracellular location of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s of interest.

Tight junction protein gene expression patterns and changes in transcript abundance during development of model fish gill epithelia
<p>In vertebrates, tight junction (TJ) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s play an important role in epithelium formation and development, the maintenance of tissue integrity and regulation of TJ permeability. In this study, primary cultured model gill epithelia composed of pavement cells (PVCs) were used to examine TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> transcript abundance during the development of epithelium confluence and epithelium resistive properties. Differences in TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> expression patterns and transcript abundance between gill models composed of PVCs and models composed of PVCs and mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) were also examined. Marked alterations in TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> transcript abundance were observed as cells developed to confluence in flask-cultured model gill epithelia. In contrast, during the formation of tissue resistance in insert-cultured epithelia (i.e. epithelia cultured on a permeable substrate), changes in TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> mRNA abundance were conservative, despite paracellular marker flux decreasing by orders of magnitude. In both cases significant changes in <i>claudin-8b, -8d, -27b, -28b</i> and -<i>32a</i> transcript abundance were observed, suggesting that temporal alterations in the abundance of these genes are important end points of model gill epithelium integrity. When MRCs were present in cultured gill models, the mRNA abundance of several TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s significantly altered and <i>claudin-10c, -10d</i> and -<i>33b</i> were only detected in preparations that included MRCs. These data provide insight into the role of select TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the formation and development of gill epithelia and the maintenance of gill barrier properties. In addition, observations reveal a heterogeneous distribution of claudin TJ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in the gill epithelial cells of rainbow trout.</p>

Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s might identify genetic determinants of risk-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of genetic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score–associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s using linear mixed-effects models in 2 population-based cohorts. We performed discovery analyses on plasma samples from 759 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, an observational study of the offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses, and validated these findings in plasma samples from 1421 participants of the MDCS (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study). To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular disease pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously. These loci explained up to 66% of interindividual plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>-level variation and, on average, accounted for 3 times the amount of variation explained by common clinical factors, such as age, sex, and diabetes mellitus status. We described overlap among many of these loci and cardiovascular disease genetic risk variants. Finally, we experimentally validated a novel association between circulating apolipo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> E levels and the transcription factor phosphatase 1G. Knockdown of phosphatase 1G in a human liver cell model resulted in decreased apolipo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> E transcription and apolipo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> E <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels in cultured supernatants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified dozens of novel genetic determinants of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s associated with the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score and experimentally validated a new role for phosphatase 1G in lipo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> biology. Further, genome-wide and exome array data for each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> have been made publicly available as a resource for cardiovascular disease research.</p></sec>

Genotype-Dependent and -Independent Calcium Signaling Dysregulation in Human Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Aberrant calcium signaling may contribute to arrhythmias and adverse remodeling in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Mutations in sarcomere genes may distinctly alter calcium handling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed gene expression, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels, and functional assays for calcium regulatory pathways in human HCM surgical samples with (n=25) and without (n=10) sarcomere mutations compared with control hearts (n=8).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Gene expression and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels for calsequestrin, L-type calcium channel, sodium-calcium exchanger, phospholamban, calcineurin, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> kinase type II (CaMKII) were similar in HCM samples compared with controls. CaMKII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> abundance was increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (<i>P</i><0.001). The CaMKII target pT17-phospholamban was 5.5-fold increased only in sarcomere-mutation HCM (<i>P</i>=0.01), as was autophosphorylated CaMKII (<i>P</i><0.01), suggestive of constitutive activation. Calcineurin (<i>PPP3CB</i>) mRNA was not increased, nor was <i>RCAN1</i> mRNA level, indicating a lack of calcineurin activation. Furthermore, myocyte enhancer factor 2 and nuclear factor of activated T cell transcription factor activity was not increased in HCM, suggesting that calcineurin pathway activation is not an upstream cause of increased CAMKII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> abundance or activation. <i>SERCA2A</i> mRNA transcript levels were reduced in HCM regardless of genotype, as was sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase 2/phospholamban <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> ratio (45% reduced; <i>P</i>=0.03). <sup>45</sup>Ca sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPaseuptake assay showed reduced uptake velocity in HCM regardless of genotype (<i>P</i>=0.01). The cardiac ryanodine receptor was not altered in transcript, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>, or phosphorylated (pS2808, pS2814) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> abundance, and [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding was not different in HCM, consistent with no major modification of the ryanodine receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Human HCM demonstrates calcium mishandling through both genotype-specific and common pathways. Posttranslational activation of the CaMKII pathway is specific to sarcomere mutation–positive HCM, whereas sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticular calcium ATPase 2 abundance and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca uptake are depressed in both sarcomere mutation–positive and –negative HCM.</p></sec>

Plasma Lipidomic Profiles Improve on Traditional Risk Factors for the Prediction of Cardiovascular Events in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Clinical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> measurements do not show the full complexity of the altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolism associated with diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>omics enables the assessment of hundreds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species as potential markers for disease risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species (310) were measured by a targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>omic analysis with liquid chromatography electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry on a case-cohort (n=3779) subset from the ADVANCE trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron-MR Controlled Evaluation). The case-cohort was 61% male with a mean age of 67 years. All participants had type 2 diabetes mellitus with ≥1 additional cardiovascular risk factors, and 35% had a history of macrovascular disease. Weighted Cox regression was used to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species associated with future cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death) and cardiovascular death during a 5-year follow-up period. Multivariable models combining traditional risk factors with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species were optimized with the Akaike information criteria. C statistics and NRIs were calculated within a 5-fold cross-validation framework.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Sphingo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s (including lyso- and ether- species), cholesteryl esters, and glycero<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s were associated with future cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. The addition of 7 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species to a base model (14 traditional risk factors and medications) to predict cardiovascular events increased the C statistic from 0.680 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.678–0.682) to 0.700 (95% CI, 0.698–0.702; <i>P</i><0.0001) with a corresponding continuous NRI of 0.227 (95% CI, 0.219–0.235). The prediction of cardiovascular death was improved with the incorporation of 4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> species into the base model, showing an increase in the C statistic from 0.740 (95% CI, 0.738–0.742) to 0.760 (95% CI, 0.757–0.762; <i>P</i><0.0001) and a continuous net reclassification index of 0.328 (95% CI, 0.317–0.339).

Normalization of NAD<sup>+</sup> Redox Balance as a Therapy for Heart Failure
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Impairments of mitochondrial function in the heart are linked intricately to the development of heart failure, but there is no therapy for mitochondrial dysfunction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed the reduced/oxidized ratio of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> acetylation in the failing heart. Proteome and acetylome analyses were followed by docking calculation, mutagenesis, and mitochondrial calcium uptake assays to determine the functional role of specific acetylation sites. The therapeutic effects of normalizing mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> acetylation by expanding the NAD<sup>+</sup> pool also were tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Increased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> hyperacetylation, previously observed in genetic models of defective mitochondrial function, also are present in human failing hearts as well as in mouse hearts with pathologic hypertrophy. Elevation of NAD<sup>+</sup> levels by stimulating the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway suppressed mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> hyperacetylation and cardiac hypertrophy, and improved cardiac function in responses to stresses. Acetylome analysis identified a subpopulation of mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that was sensitive to changes in the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio. Hyperacetylation of mitochondrial malate-aspartate shuttle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s impaired the transport and oxidation of cytosolic NADH in the mitochondria, resulting in altered cytosolic redox state and energy deficiency. Furthermore, acetylation of oligomycin-sensitive conferring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> at lysine-70 in adenosine triphosphate synthase complex promoted its interaction with cyclophilin D, and sensitized the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Both could be alleviated by normalizing the NAD<sup>+</sup> redox balance either genetically or pharmacologically.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We show that mitochondrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> hyperacetylation due to NAD<sup>+</sup> redox imbalance contributes to the pathologic remodeling of the heart via 2 distinct mechanisms. Our preclinical data demonstrate a clear benefit of normalizing NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> imbalance in the failing hearts. These findings have a high translational potential as the pharmacologic strategy of increasing NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors are feasible in humans.</p></sec>

Self-assembly of genetically encoded DNA-protein hybrid nanoscale shapes
<p>We describe an approach to bottom-up fabrication that allows integration of the functional diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s into designed three-dimensional structural frameworks. A set of custom staple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s based on transcription activator–like effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s folds a double-stranded DNA template into a user-defined shape. Each staple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> is designed to recognize and closely link two distinct double-helical DNA sequences at separate positions on the template. We present design rules for constructing megadalton-scale DNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> hybrid shapes; introduce various structural motifs, such as custom curvature, corners, and vertices; and describe principles for creating multilayer DNA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> objects with enhanced rigidity. We demonstrate self-assembly of our hybrid nanostructures in one-pot mixtures that include the genetic information for the designed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, the template DNA, RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and cofactors for transcription and translation.</p>

Cell-wide analysis of protein thermal unfolding reveals determinants of thermostability
<p>Temperature-induced cell death is thought to be due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> denaturation, but the determinants of thermal sensitivity of proteomes remain largely uncharacterized. We developed a structural proteomic strategy to measure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> thermostability on a proteome-wide scale and with domain-level resolution. We applied it to <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>Thermus thermophilus</i>, and human cells, yielding thermostability data for more than 8000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s. Our results (i) indicate that temperature-induced cellular collapse is due to the loss of a subset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with key functions, (ii) shed light on the evolutionary conservation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> and domain stability, and (iii) suggest that natively disordered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in a cell are less prevalent than predicted and (iv) that highly expressed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are stable because they are designed to tolerate translational errors that would lead to the accumulation of toxic misfolded species.</p>

<i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> HtpG Interaction with nsLTP AsE246 Is Required for Symbiotic Nitrogen Fixation
<p>Plant nonspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s (nsLTPs) are involved in a number of biological processes including root nodule symbiosis. However, the role of nsLTPs in legume-rhizobium symbiosis remains poorly understood, and no rhizobia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s that interact with nsLTPs have been reported to date. In this study, we used a bacteria two-hybrid system and identified the high temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> G (HtpG) from <i>Mesorhizobium huakuii</i> that interacts with the nsLTP AsE246. The interaction between HtpG and AsE246 was confirmed by far-Western blotting and bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Our results indicated that the heat shock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> 90 (HSP90) domain of HtpG mediates the HtpG-AsE246 interaction. Immunofluorescence assay showed that HtpG was colocalized with AsE246 in infected nodule cells and symbiosome membranes. Expression of the <i>htpG</i> gene was relatively higher in young nodules and was highly expressed in the infection zones. Further investigation showed that <i>htpG</i> expression affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> abundance and profiles in root nodules and plays an essential role in nodule development and nitrogen fixation. Our findings provide further insights into the functional mechanisms behind the transport of symbiosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s via nsLTPs in root nodules.</p>

The Role of Gβ Protein in Controlling Cell Expansion via Potential Interaction with Lipid Metabolic Pathways
<p>Heterotrimeric G-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s influence almost all aspects of plant growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in plants, likely via their interaction with specific effectors. However, the identity of such effectors and their mechanism of action are mostly unknown. While investigating the roles of different G-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> subunits in modulating the oil content in Camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>), an oil seed crop, we uncovered a role of Gβ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s in controlling anisotropic cell expansion. Knockdown of <i>Gβ</i> genes causes reduced longitudinal and enhanced transverse expansion, resulting in altered cell, tissue, and organ shapes in transgenic plants during vegetative and reproductive development. These plants also exhibited substantial changes in their fatty acid and phospho<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> profiles, which possibly leads to the increased oil content of the transgenic seeds. This increase is potentially caused by the direct interaction of Gβ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s with a specific patatin-like phospholipase, pPLAIIIδ. Camelina plants with suppressed <i>Gβ</i> expression exhibit higher lipase activity, and show phenotypes similar to plants overexpressing <i>pPLAIIIδ</i>, suggesting that the Gβ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s are negative regulators of pPLAIIIδ. These results reveal interactions between the G-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>–mediated and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> signaling/metabolic pathways, where specific phospholipases may act as effectors that control key developmental and environmental responses of plants.</p>

Differential Roles of the Thylakoid Lumenal Deg Protease Homologs in Chloroplast Proteostasis<xref><sup>,2</sup></xref>
<p>Deg proteases are involved in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> quality control in prokaryotes. Of the three Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs, Deg1, Deg5, and Deg8, located in the thylakoid lumen, Deg1 forms a homohexamer, whereas Deg5 and Deg8 form a heterocomplex. Both Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 were shown separately to degrade photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s during photoinhibition. To investigate whether Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 are redundant, a full set of Arabidopsis <i>Deg</i> knockout mutants were generated and their phenotypes were compared. Under all conditions tested, <i>deg1</i> mutants were affected more than the wild type and <i>deg5</i> and <i>deg8</i> mutants. Moreover, overexpression of Deg5-Deg8 could only partially compensate for the loss of Deg1. Comparative proteomics of <i>deg1</i> mutants revealed moderate up-regulation of thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s involved in photoprotection, assembly, repair, and housekeeping and down-regulation of those that form photosynthetic complexes. Quantification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> levels in the wild type revealed that Deg1 was 2-fold more abundant than Deg5-Deg8. Moreover, recombinant Deg1 displayed higher in vitro proteolytic activity. Affinity enrichment assays revealed that Deg1 was precipitated with very few interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, whereas Deg5-Deg8 was associated with a number of thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong>s, including D1, OECs, LHCBs, Cyt <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i>, and NDH subunits, thus implying that Deg5-Deg8 is capable of binding substrates but is unable to degrade them efficiently. This work suggests that differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">protein</span></strong> abundance and proteolytic activity underlie the differential importance of Deg1 and Deg5-Deg8 protease complexes observed in vivo.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch synthesis resulted in a significant increase in fatty acid synthesis via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the synthesis and turnover of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that blocking fatty acid peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty acids in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch synthesis under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch synthesis and fatty acid turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong>s, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty acid flux between the two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty acid β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty acid synthesis, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lipid</span></strong> metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

Genomic and epidemiological monitoring of yellow fever virus transmission potential
<p>The yellow fever virus (YFV) epidemic in Brazil is the largest in decades. The recent discovery of YFV in Brazilian <i>Aedes</i> species mosquitos highlights a need to monitor the risk of reestablishment of urban YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in the Americas. We use a suite of epidemiological, spatial, and genomic approaches to characterize YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. We show that the age and sex distribution of human cases is characteristic of sylvatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Analysis of YFV cases combined with genomes generated locally reveals an early phase of sylvatic YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and spatial expansion toward previously YFV-free areas, followed by a rise in viral spillover to humans in late 2016. Our results establish a framework for monitoring YFV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in real time that will contribute to a global strategy to eliminate future YFV epidemics.</p>

Observation of an environmentally insensitive solid-state spin defect in diamond
<p>Engineering <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent systems is a central goal of quantum science. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> centers in diamond are a promising approach, with the potential to combine the <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence of atoms with the scalability of a solid-state platform. We report a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> center that shows insensitivity to environmental de<strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence caused by phonons and electric field noise: the neutral charge state of silicon vacancy (SiV<sup>0</sup>). Through careful materials engineering, we achieved >80% conversion of implanted silicon to SiV<sup>0</sup>. SiV<sup>0</sup> exhibits spin-lattice relaxation times approaching 1 minute and <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence times approaching 1 second. Its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optical properti</span></strong>es are very favorable, with ~90% of its emission into the zero-phonon line and near–transform-limited optical linewidths. These combined properties make SiV<sup>0</sup> a promising defect for quantum network applications.</p>

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons transmitted across a ballistic semiconductor junction are expected to undergo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">refract</span></strong>ion, analogous to light rays across an optical boundary. In graphene, the linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the propagation of carriers across an electrostatically defined graphene junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell’s law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">refract</span></strong>ion. Resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for realizing electron optics based on graphene p-n junctions.</p>

EIN3-LIKE1, MYB1, and ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3 Act in a Regulatory Loop That Synergistically Modulates Ethylene Biosynthesis and Anthocyanin Accumulation
<p>Ethylene regulates climacteric fruit ripening, and EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1) plays an important role in this process. In apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation is accompanied by ethylene release during fruit ripening, but the molecular mechanism that underlies these two physiological processes is unknown. In this study, we found that ethylene treatment markedly induced fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation as well as the expression of <i>MdMYB1</i>, a positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. In addition, we found that MdEIL1 directly bound to the promoter of <i>MdMYB1</i> and transcriptionally activated its expression, which resulted in anthocyanin biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. Furthermore, MdMYB1 interacted with the promoter of <i>ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR3</i>, a key regulator of ethylene biosynthesis, thereby providing a positive feedback for ethylene biosynthesis regulation. Overall, our findings provide insight into a mechanism involving the synergistic interaction of the ethylene signal with the MdMYB1 transcription factor to regulate ethylene biosynthesis and fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation in apple.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in drug pressure, host immunity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial drugs and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at drug resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Electron diffraction determines molecular absolute configuration in a pharmaceutical nanocrystal
<p>Determination of the absolute configuration of organic molecules is essential in drug development and the subsequent approval process. We show that this determination is possible through electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffract</span></strong>ion using nanocrystalline material. Ab initio structure determination by electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffract</span></strong>ion has so far been limited to compounds that maintain their crystallinity after a dose of one electron per square angstrom or more. We present a complete structure analysis of a pharmaceutical cocrystal of sofosbuvir and <sc>l</sc>-proline, which is about one order of magnitude less stable. Data collection on multiple positions of a crystal and an advanced-intensity extraction procedure enabled us to solve the structure ab initio.

Reactivation of recall-induced neurons contributes to remote fear memory attenuation
<p>Whether fear <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation is mediated by inhibition of the original memory trace of fear with a new memory trace of safety or by updating of the original fear trace toward safety has been a long-standing question in neuroscience and psychology alike. In particular, which of the two scenarios underlies the <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation of remote (month-old) fear memories is completely unknown, despite the impetus to better understand this process against the backdrop of enduring traumata. We found—chemogenetically and in an engram-specific manner—that effective remote fear <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation is accompanied by the reactivation of memory recall–induced neurons in the dentate gyrus and that the continued activity of these neurons is critical for fear reduction.

Coherent band excitations in CePd<sub>3</sub>: A comparison of neutron scattering and ab initio theory

We show that inelastic neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing measurements of the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of CePd<sub>3</sub> provides a benchmark for ab initio calculations based on dynamical mean field theory.

Determination of intrinsic attenuation in the oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system

The strong intrinsic <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation in the asthenosphere obtained at higher frequency (~3 hertz) is comparable to that constrained at lower frequency (~100 seconds) by surface waves and suggests frequency-independent anelasticity, whereas the intrinsic <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ation in the lithosphere is frequency dependent. This difference in frequency dependence indicates that the strong and broad peak dissipation recently observed in the laboratory exists only in the asthenosphere and provides new insight into what distinguishes the asthenosphere from the lithosphere.</p>

Purcell effect for active tuning of light scattering from semiconductor optical antennas

Specifically, we illustrate how the resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing wavelength of single silicon nanowires is tunable across the entire visible spectrum by simply moving the height of the nanowires above a metallic mirror.

Femtosecond electron-phonon lock-in by photoemission and x-ray free-electron laser
<p>The interactions that lead to the emergence of superconductivity in iron-based materials remain a subject of debate. It has been suggested that electron-electron correlations enhance electron-phonon coupling in iron selenide (FeSe) and related pnictides, but direct experimental verification has been lacking. Here we show that the electron-phonon coupling strength in FeSe can be quantified by combining two time-domain experiments into a “<strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent lock-in” measurement in the terahertz regime. X-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffract</span></strong>ion tracks the light-induced femtosecond <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent lattice motion at a single phonon frequency, and photoemission monitors the subsequent <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent changes in the electronic band structure. Comparison with theory reveals a strong enhancement of the coupling strength in FeSe owing to correlation effects. Given that the electron-phonon coupling affects superconductivity exponentially, this enhancement highlights the importance of the cooperative interplay between electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions.</p>

The Potato MAP3K StVIK Is Required for the <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> RXLR Effector Pi17316 to Promote Disease
<p>Plant pathogens deliver effectors to manipulate processes in their hosts, creating a suitable environment for invasion and proliferation. Yet, little is known about the host proteins that are targeted by effectors from filamentous pathogens. Here, we show that stable transgenic expression in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) and transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> of the arginine-any amino acid-leucine-arginine effector Pi17316 enhances leaf colonization by the late blight pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>. Expression of Pi17316 also <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ates cell death triggered by the pathogen-associated molecular pattern Infestin1 (INF1), indicating that the effector suppresses pattern-triggered immunity. However, this effector does not <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ate cell death triggered by a range of resistance proteins, showing that it specifically suppresses INF1-triggered cell death (ICD). In yeast two-hybrid assays, Pi17316 interacts directly with the potato ortholog of VASCULAR HIGHWAY1-interacting kinase (StVIK), encoding a predicted MEK kinase (MAP3K). Interaction in planta was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and occurs at the plant plasma membrane. Virus-induced gene silencing of <i>VIK</i> in <i>N. benthamiana</i> <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated <i>P. infestans</i> colonization, whereas transient overexpression of <i>StVIK</i> enhanced colonization, indicating that this host protein acts as a susceptibility factor. Moreover, <i>VIK</i> overexpression specifically <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated ICD, indicating that it is a negative regulator of immunity. The abilities of Pi17316 to enhance <i>P. infestans</i> colonization or suppress ICD were compromised significantly in <i>NbVIK</i>-silenced plants, demonstrating that the effector activity of Pi17316 is mediated by this MAP3K. Thus, StVIK is exploited by <i>P. infestans</i> as a susceptibility factor to promote late blight disease.</p>

Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i>
<p>In diverse and productive habitats, predaceous arthropods are expected to frequently encounter dangerous conspecifics and heterospecifics. This should make quick and accurate discriminations between species and sexes adaptive. By simultaneously sampling both visual cues and pheromones, and by utilizing stringent species- and sex-specific visual recognition templates, an individual should be able to increase both its speed and accuracy in making such discriminations. We tested for the use and stringency of visual recognition templates in the jumping spider <i>Lyssomanes viridis</i> by presenting males with animated images of conspecifics, heterospecifics and composite images that combined the facial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation and morphology of one sex or species with the leg <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation of another. Males' courtship <i>versus</i> threat displays indicated whether a stimulus was perceived as a potential mate or a threat. By comparing males' visual inspection times of, and display types towards, the various images in the presence <i>versus</i> absence of female pheromones, we were able to deduce whether males tend to inspect a subset of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> pattern and morphological features that make up their conspecific recognition templates (i.e. those on just the face or just the legs), or all features, and whether this changes in the presence of pheromones. We found that the male recognition template for conspecific female was surprisingly coarse, whereas the recognition template for conspecific male, and especially the male face, was more specific. Pheromones hastened the recognition of images with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation and morphology closely matching those of conspecifics, presumably by activating conspecific visual recognition templates. When males were presented with an image that was, overall, a poor match to a conspecific female, but that contained a subset of female or female-like features, female pheromones usually did not hasten recognition, but did increase the likelihood that the image would be identified as a female. Taken together, our data suggest that males examined features on both the face and the legs in both the presence and absence of pheromones, and that female pheromones tipped the balance in favor of a female identification when a male was unsure how to categorize an incongruous set of visual features.</p>

Social network plasticity decreases disease transmission in a eusocial insect
<p>Animal social networks are shaped by multiple selection pressures, including the need to ensure efficient communication and functioning while simultaneously limiting disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Social animals could potentially further reduce epidemic risk by altering their social networks in the presence of pathogens, yet there is currently no evidence for such pathogen-triggered responses. We tested this hypothesis experimentally in the ant <i>Lasius niger</i> using a combination of automated tracking, controlled pathogen exposure, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion quantification, and temporally explicit simulations. Pathogen exposure induced behavioral changes in both exposed ants and their nestmates, which helped contain the disease by reinforcing key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion-inhibitory properties of the colony’s contact network. This suggests that social network plasticity in response to pathogens is an effective strategy for mitigating the effects of disease in social groups.</p>

Ultrafast disordering of vanadium dimers in photoexcited VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>Many ultrafast solid phase transitions are treated as chemical reactions that transform the structures between two different unit cells along a reaction coordinate, but this neglects the role of disorder. Although ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffract</span></strong>ion provides insights into atomic dynamics during such transformations, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffract</span></strong>ion alone probes an averaged unit cell and is less sensitive to randomness in the transition pathway. Using total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing of femtosecond x-ray pulses, we show that atomic disordering in photoexcited vanadium dioxide (VO<sub>2</sub>) is central to the transition mechanism and that, after photoexcitation, the system explores a large volume of phase space on a time scale comparable to that of a single phonon oscillation. These results overturn the current understanding of an archetypal ultrafast phase transition and provide new microscopic insights into rapid evolution toward equilibrium in photoexcited matter.</p>

The high quality of the crystals allowed collection of single-crystal x-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffract</span></strong>ion data of up to 0.83-angstrom resolution, leading to unambiguous solution and precise anisotropic refinement. Characteristics such as degree of interpenetration, arrangement of water guests, the reversed imine connectivity, linker disorder, and uncommon topology were deciphered with atomic precision—aspects impossible to determine without single crystals.</p>

German law allows use of DNA to predict suspects' looks

German federal authorities, and police in the country's 15 other states, are only allowed to perform DNA fingerprinting, in which they look for an exact match between crime scene DNA and samples in a database of known criminals or from a suspect. DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction, however, have been used in the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, Canada, and several U.S. states. Some critics caution that although the underlying science connecting genetic markers to certain physical features is solid, DNA phenotyping and ancestry prediction still come with significant uncertainties that can be easily misunderstood by police and the public.</p>

However, a lack of traits known to be under direct selection by anthropogenic climate change has limited the incorporation of evolutionary processes into global conservation efforts. In 21 vertebrate species, some individuals undergo a seasonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong> molt from summer brown to winter white as camouflage against snow, whereas other individuals remain brown. Seasonal snow duration is decreasing globally, and fitness is lower for winter white animals on snowless backgrounds. Based on 2713 georeferenced samples of known winter coat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>—from eight species across trophic levels—we identify environmentally driven clinal gradients in winter coat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>, including polymorphic zones where winter brown and white morphs co-occur. These polymorphic zones, underrepresented by existing global protected area networks, indicate hot spots for evolutionary rescue in a changing climate.</p>

Genome-wide identification of interferon-sensitive mutations enables influenza vaccine design
<p>In conventional <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated viral vaccines, immunogenicity is often suboptimal. Here we present a systematic approach for vaccine development that eliminates interferon (IFN)–modulating functions genome-wide while maintaining virus replication fitness. We applied a quantitative high-throughput genomics system to influenza A virus that simultaneously measured the replication fitness and IFN sensitivity of mutations across the entire genome. By incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, we generated a hyper–interferon-sensitive (HIS) virus as a vaccine candidate. HIS virus is highly <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses, elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses, and provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges. Our approach, which <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">attenu</span></strong>ates the virus and promotes immune responses concurrently, is broadly applicable for vaccine development against other pathogens.</p>

Observation of mean path length invariance in light-scattering media
<p>The microstructure of a medium strongly influences how light propagates through it. The amount of disorder it contains determines whether the medium is transparent or opaque. Theory predicts that exciting such a medium homogeneously and isotropically makes some of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">optical properti</span></strong>es depend only on the medium’s outer geometry. Here, we report an optical experiment demonstrating that the mean path length of light is invariant with respect to the microstructure of the medium it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>s through. Using colloidal solutions with varying concentration and particle size, the invariance of the mean path length is observed over nearly two orders of magnitude in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing strength. Our results can be extended to a wide range of systems—however ordered, correlated, or disordered—and apply to all wave-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing problems.</p>

Spindle asymmetry drives non-Mendelian chromosome segregation
<p>Genetic elements compete for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion through meiosis, when haploid gametes are created from a diploid parent. Selfish elements can enhance their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion through a process known as meiotic drive. In female meiosis, selfish elements drive by preferentially attaching to the egg side of the spindle. This implies some asymmetry between the two sides of the spindle, but the molecular mechanisms underlying spindle asymmetry are unknown. Here we found that CDC42 signaling from the cell cortex regulated microtubule tyrosination to induce spindle asymmetry and that non-Mendelian segregation depended on this asymmetry. Cortical CDC42 depends on polarization directed by chromosomes, which are positioned near the cortex to allow the asymmetric cell division. Thus, selfish meiotic drivers exploit the asymmetry inherent in female meiosis to bias their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion.</p>

Quantum control of molecular collisions at 1 kelvin
<p>Measurement of vector correlations in molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing is an indispensable tool for mapping out interaction potentials. In a coexpanded supersonic beam, we have studied the rotationally inelastic process wherein deuterium hydride (HD) (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) collides with molecular deuterium (D<sub>2</sub>) to form HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 1), where <i>v</i> and <i>j</i> are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers, respectively. HD (<i>v </i>= 1, <i>j </i>= 2) was prepared by Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage, with its bond axis aligned preferentially parallel or perpendicular to the lab-fixed relative velocity. The coexpansion brought the collision temperature down to 1 kelvin, restricting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing to s and p partial waves. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scatter</span></strong>ing angular distributions showed a dramatic stereodynamic preference (~3:1) for perpendicular versus parallel alignment.

Where has all the Zika gone?
<p>Only one case of locally transmitted Zika virus has been documented in the United States this year, a reflection of the fact that cases have plummeted in Latin America and the Caribbean. Experts say the cause of the drop has nothing to do with efforts to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease or the impact of climate on their populations. Rather, the rapid spread of the virus through the Americas—which had its first reported case in Brazil in April 2015—left large swaths of the population immune. This so-called "herd immunity" has made it increasingly difficult for the Zika virus to find susceptible people, breaking the cycle of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion between humans and mosquitoes. The drop in cases has not lessened the push to develop a vaccine against Zika, which caused widespread alarm after thousands of babies in Brazil were born with brain deformities that studies have shown are linked to the mothers being infected by the virus while they were pregnant. But with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion in the region becoming scarce, it does complicate efforts of clinical trials that hope to show lower rates of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and disease in vaccinated people.

Neutron scattering in the proximate quantum spin liquid α-RuCl<sub>3</sub>

Submillihertz magnetic spectroscopy performed with a nanoscale quantum sensor
<p>Precise timekeeping is critical to metrology, forming the basis by which standards of time, length, and fundamental constants are determined. Stable clocks are particularly valuable in spectroscopy because they define the ultimate frequency precision that can be reached. In quantum metrology, the qubit <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence time defines the clock stability, from which the spectral linewidth and frequency precision are determined.

Dengue diversity across spatial and temporal scales: Local structure and the effect of host population size
<p>A fundamental mystery for dengue and other infectious pathogens is how observed patterns of cases relate to actual chains of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion events. These pathways are intimately tied to the mechanisms by which strains interact and compete across spatial scales. Phylogeographic methods have been used to characterize pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al at global and regional scales but have yielded few insights into the local spatiotemporal structure of endemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. Using geolocated genotype (800 cases) and serotype (17,291 cases) data, we show that in Bangkok, Thailand, 60% of dengue cases living <200 meters apart come from the same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion chain, as opposed to 3% of cases separated by 1 to 5 kilometers. At distances <200 meters from a case (encompassing an average of 1300 people in Bangkok), the effective number of chains is 1.7. This number rises by a factor of 7 for each 10-fold increase in the population of the “enclosed” region. This trend is observed regardless of whether population density or area increases, though increases in density over 7000 people per square kilometer do not lead to additional chains. Within Thailand these chains quickly mix, and by the next dengue season viral lineages are no longer highly spatially structured within the country. In contrast, viral flow to neighboring countries is limited. These findings are consistent with local, density-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion and implicate densely populated communities as key sources of viral diversity, with home location the focal point of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion. These findings have important implications for targeted vector control and active surveillance.</p>

Suppressing relaxation in superconducting qubits by quasiparticle pumping
<p>Dynamical error suppression techniques are commonly used to improve <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence in quantum systems. They reduce dephasing errors by applying control pulses designed to reverse erroneous <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent evolution driven by environmental noise. However, such methods cannot correct for irreversible processes such as energy relaxation. We investigate a complementary, stochastic approach to reducing errors: Instead of deterministically reversing the unwanted qubit evolution, we use control pulses to shape the noise environment dynamically. In the context of superconducting qubits, we implement a pumping sequence to reduce the number of unpaired electrons (quasiparticles) in close proximity to the device. A 70% reduction in the quasiparticle density results in a threefold enhancement in qubit relaxation times and a comparable reduction in <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ence variability.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Polyamines Regulate Strawberry Fruit Ripening by Abscisic Acid, Auxin, and Ethylene<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Polyamines (PAs) participate in many plant growth and developmental processes, including fruit ripening. However, it is not clear whether PAs play a role in the ripening of strawberry (<i>Fragaria ananassa</i>), a model nonclimacteric plant. Here, we found that the content of the PA spermine (Spm) increased more sharply after the onset of fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation than did that of the PAs putrescine (Put) or spermidine (Spd). Spm dominance in ripe fruit resulted from abundant transcripts of a strawberry <i>S</i>-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-Met decarboxylase gene (<i>FaSAMDC</i>), which encodes an enzyme that generates a residue needed for PA biosynthesis. Exogenous Spm and Spd promoted fruit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation, while exogenous Put and a SAMDC inhibitor inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>ation. Based on transcriptome data, up- and down-regulation of <i>FaSAMDC</i> expression promoted and inhibited ripening, respectively, which coincided with changes in several physiological parameters and their corresponding gene transcripts, including firmness, anthocyanin content, sugar content, polyamine content, auxin (indole-3-acetic acid [IAA]) content, abscisic acid (ABA) content, and ethylene emission. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we found that FaSAMDC also had a high enzymatic activity with a <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> of 1.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup> <sc>m</sc>. In conclusion, PAs, especially Spm, regulate strawberry fruit ripening in an ABA-dominated, IAA-participating, and ethylene-coordinated manner, and FaSAMDC plays an important role in ripening.</p>

The <i>RIN-MC</i> Fusion of MADS-Box Transcription Factors Has Transcriptional Activity and Modulates Expression of Many Ripening Genes
<p>Fruit development and ripening is regulated by genetic and environmental factors and is of critical importance for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al, reproduction, and fruit quality. Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>ripening inhibitor</i> (<i>rin</i>) mutant fruit have a classic ripening-inhibited phenotype, which is attributed to a genomic DNA deletion resulting in the fusion of two truncated transcription factors, <i>RIN</i> and <i>MC</i>. In wild-type fruit, RIN, a MADS-box transcription factor, is a key regulator of the ripening gene expression network, with hundreds of gene targets controlling changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>, flavor, texture, and taste during tomato fruit ripening; <i>MC</i>, on the other hand, has low expression in fruit, and the potential functions of the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene in ripening remain unclear. Here, overexpression of <i>RIN-MC</i> in transgenic wild-type cv Ailsa Craig tomato fruits impaired several ripening processes, and down-regulating <i>RIN-MC</i> expression in the <i>rin</i> mutant was found to stimulate the normal yellow mutant fruit to produce a weak red <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>, suggesting a distinct negative role for <i>RIN-MC</i> in tomato fruit ripening. By comparative transcriptome analysis of <i>rin</i> and <i>rin 35S</i>::<i>RIN-MC</i> RNA interference fruits, a total of 1,168 and 1,234 genes were identified as potential targets of RIN-MC activation and inhibition. Furthermore, the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene was shown to be translated into a chimeric transcription factor that was localized to the nucleus and was capable of protein interactions with other MADS-box factors. These results indicated that tomato RIN-MC fusion plays a negative role in ripening and encodes a chimeric transcription factor that modulates the expression of many ripening genes, thereby contributing to the <i>rin</i> mutant phenotype.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid dynamics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid dynamics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid dynamics and the maintenance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals

We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of separation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At separations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

The mechanism by which α-syn PFF spreads from neuron to neuron is not known. Here, we show that LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3) binds α-syn PFF with high affinity (dissociation constant = 77 nanomolar), whereas the α-syn monomer exhibited minimal binding. α-Syn-biotin PFF binding to LAG3 initiated α-syn PFF endocytosis, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion, and toxicity. Lack of LAG3 substantially delayed α-syn PFF–induced loss of dopamine neurons, as well as biochemical and behavioral deficits in vivo. The identification of LAG3 as a receptor that binds α-syn PFF provides a target for developing therapeutics designed to slow the progression of PD and related α-synucleinopathies.</p>

Spatially Distributed Local Fields in the Hippocampus Encode Rat Position
<sec><title>Extracting Spatial Information</title><p>The location of a rat can be deciphered from hippocampal activity by detecting the firing of individual place-selective neurons. In contrast, the local field potential (LFP), which arises from the <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent voltage fluctuations of large hippocampal cell populations, has been hard to decode. <bold>Agarwal <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 626) worked out how to recover positional information exclusively from multiple-site LFP measurements in the rat hippocampus. The information was as precise as that derived from spiking place cells. The approach might also be applicable more generally for deciphering information from <strong><span style="<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">color</span></strong>:yellowgreen">coher</span></strong>ent population activity anywhere in the brain.</p></sec>

Simultaneous Femtosecond X-ray Spectroscopy and Diffraction of Photosystem II at Room Temperature
<sec><title>One Protein, Two Probes</title><p>A central challenge in the use of x-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffract</span></strong>ion to characterize macromolecular structure is the propensity of the high-energy radiation to damage the sample during data collection. Recently, a powerful accelerator-based, ultrafast x-ray laser source has been used to determine the geometric structures of small protein crystals too fragile for conventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diffract</span></strong>ion techniques. <bold>Kern <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 491, published online 14 February) now pair this method with concurrent x-ray emission spectroscopy to probe electronic structure, as well as geometry, and were able to characterize the metal oxidation states in the oxygen-evolving complex within photosystem II crystals, while simultaneously verifying the surrounding protein structure.</p></sec>

Network-Based Diffusion Analysis Reveals Cultural Transmission of Lobtail Feeding in Humpback Whales
<sec><title>Animal Culture</title><p>Cultural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion of information occurs when individuals learn from others with more experience or when individuals come to accept particular modes of behavior as the local norm. Such information transfer can be expected in highly social or long-lived species where contact and time for learning are maximized and are seen in humans (see the Perspective by <bold>de Waal</bold>). Using a network-based diffusion analysis on a long-term data set that includes tens of thousands of observations of individual humpback whales, <bold>Allen <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 485) show that an innovative feeding behavior has spread through social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion since it first emerged in a single individual in 1980.

Direct Comparison of Leaf Plasmodesma Structure and Function in Relation to Phloem-Loading Type
<p>The export of photosynthetically produced sugars from leaves depends on plasmodesmatal transport of sugar molecules from mesophyll to phloem. Traditionally, the density of plasmodesmata (PD) along this phloem-loading pathway has been used as a defining feature of different phloem-loading types, with species proposed to have either many or few PD between the phloem and surrounding cells of the leaf. However, quantitative determination of PD density has rarely been performed. Moreover, the structure of PD has not been considered, even though it could impact permeability, and functional data are only available for very few species. Here, a comparison of PD density, structure, and function using data from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron microscopy and live-cell microscopy was conducted for all relevant cell–cell interfaces in leaves of nine species. These species represent the three principal phloem-loading types currently discussed in literature. Results show that relative PD density among the different cell-cell interfaces in one species, but not absolute PD density, is indicative of phloem-loading type. PD density data of single interfaces, even combined with PD diameter and length data, did not correlate with the intercellular diffusion capacity measured by the fluorescence loss in photobleaching method. This means that PD substructure not visible on standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transmiss</span></strong>ion electron micrographs may have a strong influence on permeability. Furthermore, the results support a proposed passive symplasmic loading mechanism in the tree species horse chestnut (<i>Aesculus hippocastanum</i>), white birch (<i>Betula pubescens</i>), orchard apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>), and gray poplar (<i>Populus x canescens</i>) as functional cell coupling and PD structure differed from active symplasmic and apoplasmic phloem-loading species.</p>

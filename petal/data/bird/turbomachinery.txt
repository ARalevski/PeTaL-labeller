Left Ventricular Assist Device Malfunctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reports of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) malfunction have focused on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> thrombosis. However, the device consists of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>, driveline, and peripherals, all of which are potentially subject to failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Prospectively collected data were reviewed for all LVAD device malfunctions (DMs) occurring in rotary LVADs implanted at a single center between April 2004 and May 2016. Durable LVADs included 108 Heartmate II (HM II) and 105 HeartWare VAD (HVAD). DM data were categorized according to device type and into categories related to the component that failed: (1) controller, (2) peripheral components, and (3) implantable blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> or its integral electric driveline. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>-related events were analyzed as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>-specific (suspected or confirmed thrombosis) or non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>-specific (driveline failure). DM rates were reported as events per 1000 patient-days, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for time-to-event analyses. Cumulative rates of malfunction were examined for the main components of each type of LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Types of DM included controller failure (30%), battery failure (19%), or patient cable failure (14%), whereas only 13% were because of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> failure. DMs were more common in the HM II device (3.73 per 1000 patient-days versus 3.06 per 1000 patient-days for the HVAD, <i>P</i><0.01). A higher rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>-specific malfunctions was discovered in those implanted with an HM II versus an HVAD (0.55 versus 0.39, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01) and peripheral malfunctions (2.32 versus 1.78 for the HM II and HVAD, respectively; <i>P</i><0.01); no difference occurred in the incidence of controller DM between the 2 LVADs. Patients with HVAD were 90% free of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>-specific malfunction at 3 years compared with 56% for the HM II (log-rank <i>P</i><0.003). Only 74% of the patients with HM II were free of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> thrombosis at 3 years compared with 90% of the patients with HVAD. Freedom from failure of the integrated driveline was 79% at 3 years for the HM II but 100% for the HVAD (log-rank <i>P</i><0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Device malfunction is much broader than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> failure alone and occurs for different components at different rates based on the type of LVAD.</p></sec>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> muscles contract. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> volume and the liquid-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies.</p>

Hemocompatibility-Related Outcomes in the MOMENTUM 3 Trial at 6 Months
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The HeartMate 3 (HM3) Left Ventricular Assist System (LVAS) (Abbott) is a centrifugal, fully magnetically levitated, continuous-flow blood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> engineered to enhance hemocompatibility and reduce shear stress on blood components.

Unusual transcription factor protects against heart failure
<p>The heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>s blood to the rest of the body in a coordinated and steadfast manner. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>ing function is achieved through synchronous contraction of billions of cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), which is governed by phasic increases in intracellular calcium. As such, cardiomyocytes have evolved intricate cellular structures that tightly couple external electrical impulses to the triggering of calcium ion release from intracellular stores and subsequent activation of force-producing proteins, a process termed excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. A key component of this molecular ultrastructure is the cardiac dyad, a microdomain that juxtaposes the plasma membrane L-type calcium channel with the calcium-sensitive ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel complex, the molecular gatekeeper for the release of calcium ions from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores in cardiomyocytes. The cardiac dyad is physically stabilized by a membrane-associated scaffold protein called junctophilin-2 (JP2), which facilitates physiologic calcium release during E-C coupling. Excessive stress or injury to cardiomyocytes results in defective E-C coupling, reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>ing capacity, and the clinical syndrome of heart failure, a leading cause of death worldwide. On page 1375 of this issue, Guo <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) report the surprising discovery that during cardiac stress, a proteolytically cleaved fragment of JP2 can translocate to the cardiomyocyte nucleus and function as a transcription factor that can protect against heart failure pathogenesis. Thus, in addition to its “day job” as a structural protein, this suggest that JP2 can “moonlight” in the nucleus as part of a homeostatic feedback response to cardiac stress.</p>

<i>N</i>-Glycoproteomic Characterization of Mannosidase and Xylosyltransferase Mutant Strains of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> <i>reinhardtii</i>
<p>At present, only little is known about the enzymatic machinery required for <i>N</i>-glycosylation in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, leading to the formation of <i>N</i>-glycans harboring Xyl and methylated Man. This machinery possesses new enzymatic features, as <i>C. reinhardtii N</i>-glycans are independent of β1,2-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I. Here we have performed comparative <i>N</i>-glycoproteomic analyses of insertional mutants of mannosidase 1A (IM<i><sub>Man1A</sub></i>) and xylosyltransferase 1A (IM<i><sub>XylT1A</sub></i>). The disruption of <i>man1A</i> affected methylation of Man and the addition of terminal Xyl. The absence of XylT1A led to shorter <i>N</i>-glycans compared to the wild type. The use of a IM<i><sub>Man1A</sub></i>xIM<i><sub>XylT1A</sub></i> double mutant revealed that the absence of Man1A suppressed the IM<i><sub>XylT1A</sub></i> phenotype, indicating that the increased <i>N</i>-glycan trimming is regulated by core β1,2-Xyl and is dependent on Man1A activity. These data point toward an enzymatic cascade in the <i>N</i>-glycosylation pathway of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> with interlinked roles of Man1A and XylT1A. The results described herein represent the first step toward a functional characterization of the enzymatic <i>N</i>-glycosylation machinery in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>.</p>

Widespread control of calcium signaling by a family of SERCA-inhibiting micropeptides
<p>Micropeptides function as master regulators of calcium-dependent signaling in muscle. Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA), the membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> that promotes muscle relaxation by taking up Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is directly inhibited by three muscle-specific micropeptides: myoregulin (MLN), phospholamban (PLN), and sarcolipin (SLN). The widespread and essential function of SERCA across diverse cell types has raised questions as to how SERCA is regulated in cells that lack MLN, PLN, and SLN. We identified two transmembrane micropeptides, endoregulin (ELN) and another-regulin (ALN), that share key amino acids with their muscle-specific counterparts and function as direct inhibitors of SERCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> activity. The distribution of transcripts encoding ELN and ALN mirrored that of SERCA isoform-encoding transcripts in nonmuscle cell types. Our findings identify additional members of the SERCA-inhibitory micropeptide family, revealing a conserved mechanism for the control of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in both muscle and nonmuscle cell types.</p>

Saltational evolution of the heterotrimeric G protein signaling mechanisms in the plant kingdom
<p>Signaling proteins evolved diverse interactions to provide specificity for distinct stimuli. Signaling complexity in the G protein (heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate–binding protein) network was achieved in animals through subunit duplication and incremental evolution. By combining comprehensive and quantitative phenotypic profiles of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> with protein evolution informatics, we found that plant heterotrimeric G protein machinery evolved by a saltational (jumping) process. Sequence similarity scores mapped onto tertiary structures, and biochemical validation showed that the extra-large Gα (XLG) subunit evolved extensively in the charophycean algae (an aquatic green plant) by gene duplication and gene fusion. In terrestrial plants, further evolution uncoupled XLG from its negative regulator, regulator of G protein signaling, but preserved an α-helix region that enables interaction with its partner Gβγ. The ancestral gene evolved slowly due to the molecular constraints imposed by the need for the protein to maintain interactions with various partners, whereas the genes encoding XLG proteins evolved rapidly to produce three highly divergent members. Analysis of <i>A. thaliana</i> mutants indicated that these Gα and XLG proteins all function with Gβγ and evolved to operate both independently and cooperatively. The XLG-Gβγ machinery specialized in environmental stress responses, whereas the canonical Gα-Gβγ retained developmental roles. Some developmental processes, such as shoot development, involve both Gα and XLG acting cooperatively or antagonistically. These extensive and rapid evolutionary changes in XLG structure compared to those of the canonical Gα subunit contrast with the accepted notion of how pathway diversification occurs through gene duplication with subsequent incremental coevolution of residues among interacting proteins.</p>

Role of AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump in drug-resistance acquisition by plasmid transfer
<p>Drug-resistance dissemination by horizontal gene transfer remains poorly understood at the cellular scale. Using live-cell microscopy, we reveal the dynamics of resistance acquisition by transfer of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> fertility factor–conjugation plasmid encoding the tetracycline-efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> TetA. The entry of the single-stranded DNA plasmid into the recipient cell is rapidly followed by complementary-strand synthesis, plasmid-gene expression, and production of TetA. In the presence of translation-inhibiting antibiotics, resistance acquisition depends on the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>, because it reduces tetracycline concentrations in the cell. Protein synthesis can thus persist and TetA expression can be initiated immediately after plasmid acquisition. AcrAB-TolC efflux activity can also preserve resistance acquisition by plasmid transfer in the presence of antibiotics with other modes of action.</p>

Heterogeneity in efflux pump expression predisposes antibiotic-resistant cells to mutation
<p>Antibiotic resistance is often the result of mutations that block drug activity; however, bacteria also evade antibiotics by transiently expressing genes such as multidrug efflux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>s. A crucial question is whether transient resistance can promote permanent genetic changes. Previous studies have established that antibiotic treatment can select tolerant cells that then mutate to achieve permanent resistance. Whether these mutations result from antibiotic stress or preexist within the population is unclear. To address this question, we focused on the multidrug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> AcrAB-TolC. Using time-lapse microscopy, we found that cells with higher <i>acrAB</i> expression have lower expression of the DNA mismatch repair gene <i>mutS</i>, lower growth rates, and higher mutation frequencies. Thus, transient antibiotic resistance from elevated <i>acrAB</i> expression can promote spontaneous mutations within single cells.</p>

GTPase activity–coupled treadmilling of the bacterial tubulin FtsZ organizes septal cell wall synthesis
<p>The bacterial tubulin FtsZ is the central component of the cell division machinery, coordinating an ensemble of proteins involved in septal cell wall synthesis to ensure successful constriction. How cells achieve this coordination is unknown. We found that in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells, FtsZ exhibits dynamic treadmilling predominantly determined by its guanosine triphosphatase activity. The treadmilling dynamics direct the processive movement of the septal cell wall synthesis machinery but do not limit the rate of septal synthesis. In FtsZ mutants with severely reduced treadmilling, the spatial distribution of septal synthesis and the molecular composition and ultrastructure of the septal cell wall were substantially altered. Thus, FtsZ treadmilling provides a mechanism for achieving uniform septal cell wall synthesis to enable correct polar morphology.</p>

Modulation of Auxin Signaling and Development by Polyadenylation Machinery
<p>Polyadenylation influences gene expression by affecting mRNA stability, transport, and translatability. Here, we report that Cleavage stimulation Factor 77 (AtCstF77), a component of the pre-mRNA 3′-end polyadenylation machinery, affects polyadenylation site (PAS) selection in transcripts of some auxin signaling genes in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of <i>AtCstF77</i> reduced auxin sensitivity and decreased the expression of the auxin reporter <i>DR5</i>-<i>GFP</i>. Null mutations of <i>cstf77</i> caused severe developmental defects, but were not lethal as previously reported. <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> genetically interacted with <i>transport inhibitor response 1 auxin signaling f</i>-<i>box 2</i> auxin receptor double mutants, further supporting that polyadenylation affects auxin signaling. <i>AtCstF77</i> was ubiquitously expressed in embryos, seedlings, and adult plants. The AtCstF77 protein was localized in the nucleus, which is consistent with its function in pre-mRNA processing. We observed that PASs in transcripts from approximately 2,400 genes were shifted in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. Moreover, most of the PAS shifts were from proximal to distal sites. Auxin treatment also caused PAS shifts in transcripts from a small number of genes. Several auxin signaling or homeostasis genes had different PASs in their transcripts in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. The expression levels of <i>AUXIN RESISTANT 2</i>/<i>INDOLE</i>-<i>3</i>-<i>ACETIC ACID 7</i> were significantly increased in the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant, which can partially account for the auxin resistance phenotype of this mutant. Our results demonstrate that AtCstF77 plays pleiotropic and critical roles in Arabidopsis development. Moreover, disruption of AtCstF64, another component of the polyadenylation machinery, led to developmental defects and reduced auxin response, similar to those of the <i>cstf77</i>-<i>2</i> mutant. We conclude that AtCstF77 affects auxin responses, likely by controlling PAS selection of transcripts of some auxin signaling components.</p>

The Impacts of Phosphorus Deficiency on the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain
<p>Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and P deficiency limits plant productivity. Recent work showed that P deficiency affects electron transport to photosystem I (PSI), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive biological model describing how P deficiency disrupts the photosynthetic machinery and the electron transport chain through a series of sequential events in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). P deficiency reduces the orthophosphate concentration in the chloroplast stroma to levels that inhibit ATP synthase activity. Consequently, protons accumulate in the thylakoids and cause lumen acidification, which inhibits linear electron flow. Limited plastoquinol oxidation retards electron transport to the cytochrome <i>b<sub>6</sub>f</i> complex, yet the electron transfer rate of PSI is increased under steady-state growth light and is limited under high-light conditions. Under P deficiency, the enhanced electron flow through PSI increases the levels of NADPH, whereas ATP production remains restricted and, hence, reduces CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. In parallel, lumen acidification activates the energy-dependent quenching component of the nonphotochemical quenching mechanism and prevents the overexcitation of photosystem II and damage to the leaf tissue. Consequently, plants can be severely affected by P deficiency for weeks without displaying any visual leaf symptoms. All of the processes in the photosynthetic machinery influenced by P deficiency appear to be fully reversible and can be restored in less than 60 min after resupply of orthophosphate to the leaf tissue.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Differential Codon Adaptation between dsDNA and ssDNA Phages in <i>Escherichia coli</i>
<p>Because phages use their host translation machinery, their codon usage should evolve toward that of highly expressed host genes. We used two indices to measure codon adaptation of phages to their host, <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> (the correlation in relative synonymous codon usage [RSCU] between phages and their host) and Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) computed with highly expressed host genes as the reference set (because phage translation depends on host translation machinery). These indices used for this purpose are appropriate only when hosts exhibit little mutation bias, so only phages parasitizing <i>Escherichia coli</i> were included in the analysis. For double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) phages, both <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> and CAI decrease with increasing number of transfer RNA genes encoded by the phage genome. <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> is greater for dsDNA phages than for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) phages, and the low <i>r</i><sub>RSCU</sub> values are mainly due to poor concordance in RSCU values for Y-ending codons between ssDNA phages and the <i>E. coli</i> host, consistent with the predicted effect of C→T mutation bias in the ssDNA phages. Strong C→T mutation bias would improve codon adaptation in codon families (e.g., Gly) where U-ending codons are favored over C-ending codons (“U-friendly” codon families) by highly expressed host genes but decrease codon adaptation in other codon families where highly expressed host genes favor C-ending codons against U-ending codons (“U-hostile” codon families). It is remarkable that ssDNA phages with increasing C→T mutation bias also increased the usage of codons in the “U-friendly” codon families, thereby achieving CAI values almost as large as those of dsDNA phages. This represents a new type of codon adaptation.</p>

High-Target Versus Low-Target Blood Pressure Management During Cardiopulmonary Bypass to Prevent Cerebral Injury in Cardiac Surgery Patients

The rate of overt stroke after cardiac surgery is 1% to 2%, whereas silent strokes, detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, are found in up to 50% of patients. It is unclear whether a higher versus a lower blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass reduces cerebral infarction in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a patient- and assessor-blinded randomized trial, we allocated patients to a higher (70–80 mm Hg) or lower (40–50 mm Hg) target for mean arterial pressure by the titration of norepinephrine during cardiopulmonary bypass. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> flow was fixed at 2.4 L·min<sup>−1</sup>·m<sup>−2</sup>. The primary outcome was the total volume of new ischemic cerebral lesions (summed in millimeters cubed), expressed as the difference between diffusion-weighted imaging conducted preoperatively and again postoperatively between days 3 and 6.

Procedural risk scores were comparable between groups. Overall, diffusion-weighted imaging revealed new cerebral lesions in 52.8% of patients in the low-target group versus 55.7% in the high-target group (<i>P</i>=0.76).

Myosin IIA deficient cells migrate efficiently despite reduced traction forces at cell periphery
<p>Cell motility is a cornerstone of embryogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair, and cancer cell invasion. It is generally thought that migrating cells grab and exert traction force onto the extracellular matrix in order to pull the cell body forward. While previous studies have shown that myosin II deficient cells migrate efficiently, whether these cells exert traction forces during cell migration in the absence of the major contractile machinery is currently unknown. Using an array of micron-sized pillars as a force sensor and shRNA specific to each myosin II isoform (A and B), we analyzed how myosin IIA and IIB individually regulate cell migration and traction force generation. Myosin IIA and IIB localized preferentially to the leading edge where traction force was greatest, and the trailing edge, respectively. When individual myosin II isoforms were depleted by shRNA, myosin IIA deficient cells lost actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas myosin IIB deficient cells maintained similar actin organization and focal adhesions as wild-type cells. Interestingly, myosin IIA deficient cells migrated faster than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells on both a rigid surface and a pillar array, yet myosin IIA deficient cells exerted significantly less traction force at the leading edge than wild-type or myosin IIB deficient cells. These results suggest that, in the absence of myosin IIA mediated force-generating machinery, cells move with minimal traction forces at the cell periphery, thus demonstrating the remarkable ability of cells to adapt and migrate.</p>

RNA G-quadruplexes are globally unfolded in eukaryotic cells and depleted in bacteria
<p>In vitro, some RNAs can form stable four-stranded structures known as G-quadruplexes. Although RNA G-quadruplexes have been implicated in posttranscriptional gene regulation and diseases, direct evidence for their formation in cells has been lacking. Here, we identified thousands of mammalian RNA regions that can fold into G-quadruplexes in vitro, but in contrast to previous assumptions, these regions were overwhelmingly unfolded in cells. Model RNA G-quadruplexes that were unfolded in eukaryotic cells were folded when ectopically expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>; however, they impaired translation and growth, which helps explain why we detected few G-quadruplex–forming regions in bacterial transcriptomes. Our results suggest that eukaryotes have a robust machinery that globally unfolds RNA G-quadruplexes, whereas some bacteria have instead undergone evolutionary depletion of G-quadruplex–forming sequences.</p>

Unusual Roles of Secretory SNARE SYP132 in Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase Traffic and Vegetative Plant Growth
<p>The plasma membrane proton (H<sup>+</sup>)-ATPases of plants generate steep electrochemical gradients and activate osmotic solute uptake. H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase-mediated proton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>ing orchestrates cellular homeostasis and is a prerequisite for plastic cell expansion and plant growth. All evidence suggests that the population of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma membrane reflects a balance of their roles in exocytosis, endocytosis, and recycling. Auxin governs both traffic and activation of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins already present at the membrane. As in other eukaryotes, in plants, SNARE-mediated membrane traffic influences the density of several proteins at the plasma membrane. Even so, H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic, its relationship with SNAREs, and its regulation by auxin have remained enigmatic. Here, we identify the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) Qa-SNARE SYP132 (Syntaxin of Plants132) as a key factor in H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and demonstrate its association with endocytosis. SYP132 is a low-abundant, secretory SNARE that primarily localizes to the plasma membrane. We find that <i>SYP132</i> expression is tightly regulated by auxin and that augmented SYP132 expression reduces the amount of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteins at the plasma membrane. The physiological consequences of SYP132 overexpression include reduced apoplast acidification and suppressed vegetative growth. Thus, SYP132 plays unexpected and vital roles in auxin-regulated H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase traffic and associated functions at the plasma membrane.</p>

Synergistic Pectin Degradation and Guard Cell Pressurization Underlie Stomatal Pore Formation
<p>Stomatal pores are vital for the diffusion of gasses into and out of land plants and are, therefore, gatekeepers for photosynthesis and transpiration. Although much published literature has described the intercellular signaling and transcriptional regulators involved in early stomatal development, little is known about the cellular details of the local separation between sister guard cells that give rise to the stomatal pore or how formation of this pore is achieved. Using three-dimensional (3D) time-lapse imaging, we found that stomatal pore formation in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is a highly dynamic process involving pore initiation and enlargement and traverses a set of morphological milestones in 3D. Confocal imaging data revealed an enrichment of exocytic machinery, de-methyl-esterified pectic homogalacturonan (HG), and an HG-degrading enzyme at future pore sites, suggesting that both localized HG deposition and degradation might function in pore formation. By manipulating HG modification via enzymatic, chemical, and genetic perturbations in seedling cotyledons, we found that augmenting HG modification promotes pore formation, whereas preventing HG de-methyl-esterification delays pore initiation and inhibits pore enlargement. Through mechanical modeling and experimentation, we tested whether pore formation is an outcome of sister guard cells being pulled away from each other upon turgor increase. Osmotic treatment to reduce turgor pressure did not prevent pore initiation but did lessen pore enlargement. Together, these data provide evidence that HG delivery and modification, and guard cell pressurization, make functional contributions to stomatal pore initiation and enlargement.</p>

Evolution of Cold Acclimation and Its Role in Niche Transition in the Temperate Grass Subfamily Pooideae
<p>The grass subfamily Pooideae dominates the grass floras in cold temperate regions and has evolved complex physiological adaptations to cope with extreme environmental conditions like frost, winter, and seasonality. One such adaptation is cold acclimation, wherein plants increase their frost tolerance in response to gradually falling temperatures and shorter days in the autumn. However, understanding how complex traits like cold acclimation evolve remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Here, we investigated the evolution of cold acclimation in Pooideae and found that a phylogenetically diverse set of Pooideae species displayed cold acclimation capacity. However, comparing differential gene expression after cold treatment in transcriptomes of five phylogenetically diverse species revealed widespread species-specific responses of genes with conserved sequences. Furthermore, we studied the correlation between gene family size and number of cold-responsive genes as well as between selection pressure on coding sequences of genes and their cold responsiveness. We saw evidence of protein-coding and regulatory sequence evolution as well as the origin of novel genes and functions contributing toward evolution of a cold response in Pooideae. Our results reflect that selection pressure resulting from global cooling must have acted on already diverged lineages. Nevertheless, conservation of cold-induced gene expression of certain genes indicates that the Pooideae ancestor may have possessed some molecular machinery to mitigate cold stress. Evolution of adaptations to seasonally cold climates is regarded as particularly difficult. How Pooideae evolved to transition from tropical to temperate biomes sheds light on how complex traits evolve in the light of climate changes.</p>

A Synthetic Oxygen Sensor for Plants Based on Animal Hypoxia Signaling
<p>Due to the involvement of oxygen in many essential metabolic reactions, all living organisms have developed molecular systems that allow adaptive physiological and metabolic transitions depending on oxygen availability. In mammals, the expression of hypoxia-response genes is controlled by the heterodimeric Hypoxia-Inducible Factor. The activity of this transcriptional regulator is linked mainly to the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of conserved proline residues in its α-subunit, carried out by prolyl-hydroxylases, and subsequent ubiquitination via the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, which targets Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-α to the proteasome. By exploiting bioengineered versions of this mammalian oxygen sensor, we designed and optimized a synthetic device that drives gene expression in an oxygen-dependent fashion in plants. Transient assays in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts indicated that a combination of the yeast Gal4/upstream activating sequence system and the mammalian oxygen sensor machinery can be used effectively to engineer a modular, oxygen-inducible transcriptional regulator. This synthetic device also was shown to be selectively controlled by oxygen in whole plants when its components were expressed stably in Arabidopsis seedlings. We envision the exploitation of our genetically encoded controllers to generate plants able to switch gene expression selectively depending on oxygen availability, thereby providing a proof of concept for the potential of synthetic biology to assist agricultural practices in environments with variable oxygen provision.</p>

The SUMO Conjugation Complex Self-Assembles into Nuclear Bodies Independent of SIZ1 and COP1
<p>Attachment of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) to substrate proteins modulates their turnover, activity, or interaction partners. However, how this SUMO conjugation activity concentrates the proteins involved and the substrates into uncharacterized nuclear bodies (NBs) remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized the requirements for SUMO NB formation and for their subsequent colocalization with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), a master regulator of plant growth. COP1 activity results in degradation of transcription factors, which primes the transcriptional response that underlies elongation growth induced by darkness and high ambient temperatures (skoto- and thermomorphogenesis, respectively). SUMO conjugation activity alone was sufficient to target the SUMO machinery into NBs. Colocalization of these bodies with COP1 required, in addition to SUMO conjugation activity, a SUMO acceptor site in COP1 and the SUMO E3 ligase SAP and Miz 1 (SIZ1). We found that SIZ1 docks in the substrate-binding pocket of COP1 via two valine-proline peptide motifs, which represent a known interaction motif of COP1 substrates. The data reveal that SIZ1 physically connects COP1 and SUMO conjugation activity in the same NBs that can also contain the blue-light receptors CRYPTOCHROME 1 and CRYPTOCHROME 2. Our findings thus suggest that sumoylation stimulates COP1 activity within NBs. Moreover, the presence of SIZ1 and SUMO in these NBs explains how both the timing and amplitude of the high-temperature growth response is controlled. The strong colocalization of COP1 and SUMO in these NBs might also explain why many COP1 substrates are sumoylated.</p>

A Temperature-Sensitive Misfolded bri1-301 Receptor Requires Its Kinase Activity to Promote Growth
<p>BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) is a leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinase that functions as the cell surface receptor for brassinosteroids (BRs). Previous studies showed that BRI1 requires its kinase activity to transduce the extracellular BR signal into the nucleus. Among the many reported mutant <i>bri1</i> alleles, <i>bri1-301</i> is unique, as its glycine-989-to-isoleucine mutation completely inhibits its kinase activity in vitro but only gives rise to a weak dwarf phenotype compared with strong or null <i>bri1</i> alleles, raising the question of whether kinase activity is essential for the biological function of BRI1. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) bri1-301 mutant receptor exhibits weak BR-triggered phosphorylation in vivo and absolutely requires its kinase activity for the limited growth that occurs in the <i>bri1-301</i> mutant. We also show that bri1-301 is a temperature-sensitive misfolded protein that is rapidly degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum and at the plasma membrane by yet unknown mechanisms. A temperature increase from 22°C to 29°C reduced the protein stability and biochemical activity of bri1-301, likely due to temperature-enhanced protein misfolding. The bri1-301 protein could be used as a model to study the degradation machinery for misfolded membrane proteins with cytosolic structural lesions and the plasma membrane-associated protein quality-control mechanism.</p>

The Patterned Structure of Galactoglucomannan Suggests It May Bind to Cellulose in Seed Mucilage
<p>The interaction between mannan polysaccharides and cellulose microfibrils contributes to cell wall properties in some vascular plants, but the molecular arrangement of mannan in the cell wall and the nature of the molecular bonding between mannan and cellulose remain unknown. Previous studies have shown that mannan is important in maintaining Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed mucilage architecture, and that Cellulose Synthase-Like A2 (CSLA2) synthesizes a glucomannan backbone, which Mannan α-Galactosyl Transferase1 (MAGT1/GlycosylTransferase-Like6/Mucilage Related10) might decorate with single α-Gal branches. Here, we investigated the ratio and sequence of Man and Glc and the arrangement of Gal residues in Arabidopsis mucilage mannan using enzyme sequential digestion, carbohydrate gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry. We found that seed mucilage galactoglucomannan has a backbone consisting of the repeating disaccharide [4)-β-Glc-(1,4)-β-Man-(1,], and most of the Man residues in the backbone are substituted by single α-1,6-Gal. CSLA2 is responsible for the synthesis of this patterned glucomannan backbone and MAGT1 catalyses the addition of α-Gal. In vitro activity assays revealed that MAGT1 transferred α-Gal from UDP-Gal only to Man residues within the CSLA2 patterned glucomannan backbone acceptor. These results indicate that CSLAs and galactosyltransferases are able to make precisely defined galactoglucomannan structures. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested this patterned galactoglucomannan is able to bind stably to some hydrophilic faces and to hydrophobic faces of cellulose microfibrils. A specialization of the biosynthetic machinery to make galactoglucomannan with a patterned structure may therefore regulate the mode of binding of this hemicellulose to cellulose fibrils.</p>

SMALL AUXIN UP RNA62/75 Are Required for the Translation of Transcripts Essential for Pollen Tube Growth
<p>Successful pollen tube elongation is critical for double fertilization, but the biological functions of pollen tube genes and the regulatory machinery underlying this crucial process are largely unknown. A previous translatomic study revealed two Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAUR</i> (<i>SMALL AUXIN UP RNA</i>) genes, <i>SAUR62</i> and <i>SAUR75</i>, whose expression is up-regulated by pollination. Here, we found that both SAUR62 and SAUR75 localized mainly to pollen tube nuclei. The siliques of homozygous <i>saur62</i> (<i>saur62/−</i>), <i>saur75</i> (<i>saur75/−</i>), and the <i>SAUR62</i>/<i>75</i> RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown line had many aborted seeds. These lines had normal pollen viability but defective in vitro and in vivo pollen tube growth, with branching phenotypes. Immunoprecipitation with transgenic SAUR62/75-GFP flowers revealed ribosomal protein RPL12 family members as potential interacting partners, and their individual interactions were confirmed further by yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. Polysome profiling showed reduced 80S ribosome abundance in homozygous <i>saur62</i>, <i>saur75</i>, <i>ribosomal large subunit12c</i>, and <i>SAUR62/75</i> RNAi flowers, suggesting that SAUR62/75 play roles in ribosome assembly. To clarify their roles in translation, we analyzed total proteins from RNAi versus wild-type flowers by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, revealing significantly reduced expression of factors participating in pollen tube wall biogenesis and F-actin dynamics, which are critical for the elastic properties of tube elongation. Indeed, RNAi pollen tubes showed mislocalization of deesterified and esterified pectins and F-actin organization. Thus, the biological roles of SAUR62/75 and their RPL12 partners are critical in ribosomal pre-60S subunit assembly for efficient pollen tube elongation and subsequent fertilization.</p>

OsDER1 Is an ER-Associated Protein Degradation Factor That Responds to ER Stress
<p>Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) plays an important role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control. To date, little is known about the retrotranslocation machinery in the plant ERAD pathway. We obtained a DERLIN-like protein (OsDER1) through a SWATH-based quantitative proteomic analysis of ER membrane proteins extracted from ER-stressed rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) seeds. OsDER1, a homolog of yeast and mammal DER1, is localized in the ER and accumulates significantly under ER stress. Overexpression or suppression of OsDER1 in rice leads to activation of the unfolded protein response and hypersensitivity to ER stress, and suppression results in floury, shrunken seeds. In addition, the expression levels of polyubiquitinated proteins increased markedly in <i>OsDER1</i> overexpression or suppression transgenic rice. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsDER1 interacted with OsHRD1, OsHRD3, and OsCDC48, the essential components of the canonical ERAD pathway. Furthermore, OsDER1 associated with the signal peptide peptidase, a homolog of a component of the alternative ERAD pathway identified recently in yeast and mammals. Our data suggest that OsDER1 is linked to the ERAD pathway.</p>

ALY RNA-Binding Proteins Are Required for Nucleocytosolic mRNA Transport and Modulate Plant Growth and Development
<p>The regulated transport of mRNAs from the cell nucleus to the cytosol is a critical step linking transcript synthesis and processing with translation. However, in plants, only a few of the factors that act in the mRNA export pathway have been functionally characterized. Flowering plant genomes encode several members of the ALY protein family, which function as mRNA export factors in other organisms. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ALY1 to ALY4 are commonly detected in root and leaf cells, but they are differentially expressed in reproductive tissue. Moreover, the subnuclear distribution of ALY1/2 differs from that of ALY3/4. ALY1 binds with higher affinity to single-stranded RNA than double-stranded RNA and single-stranded DNA and interacts preferentially with 5-methylcytosine-modified single-stranded RNA. Compared with the full-length protein, the individual RNA recognition motif of ALY1 binds RNA only weakly. ALY proteins interact with the RNA helicase UAP56, indicating a link to the mRNA export machinery. Consistently, ALY1 complements the lethal phenotype of yeast cells lacking the ALY1 ortholog Yra1. Whereas individual <i>aly</i> mutants have a wild-type appearance, disruption of <i>ALY1</i> to <i>ALY4</i> in <i>4xaly</i> plants causes vegetative and reproductive defects, including strongly reduced growth, altered flower morphology, as well as abnormal ovules and female gametophytes, causing reduced seed production. Moreover, polyadenylated mRNAs accumulate in the nuclei of <i>4xaly</i> cells. Our results highlight the requirement of efficient mRNA nucleocytosolic transport for proper plant growth and development and indicate that ALY1 to ALY4 act partly redundantly in this process; however, differences in expression and subnuclear localization suggest distinct functions.</p>

Plant Temperature Acclimation and Growth Rely on Cytosolic Ribosome Biogenesis Factor Homologs
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) REI1-LIKE (REIL) proteins, REIL1 and REIL2, are homologs of a yeast ribosome biogenesis factor that participates in late cytoplasmic 60S ribosomal subunit maturation. Here, we report that the inhibited growth of the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant at 10°C can be rescued by the expression of amino-terminal FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (FP)-REIL fusions driven by the <i>UBIQUITIN10</i> promoter, allowing the analysis of REIL function in planta. Arabidopsis REIL1 appears to be functionally conserved, based on the cytosolic localization of FP-REIL1 and the interaction of native REIL1 with the 60S subunit in wild-type plants. In contrast to its yeast homologs, REIL1 also was present in translating ribosome fractions. Systems analysis revealed that wild-type Arabidopsis remodels the cytosolic translation machinery when grown at 10°C by accumulating cytosolic ribosome subunits and inducing the expression of cytosolic ribosomal RNA, ribosomal genes, ribosome biogenesis factors, and translation initiation or elongation factors. In the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant, all processes associated with inhibited growth were delayed, although the plants maintained cellular integrity or acquired freezing tolerance. REIL proteins also were implicated in plant-specific processes: nonacclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> exhibited cold-acclimation responses, including activation of the DREB/CBF regulon. In addition, acclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> plants failed to activate <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> expression in mature leaves. Therefore, in the wild type, REIL function may contribute to temperature perception by suppressing premature cold responses during growth at nonstressful temperatures. In conclusion, we suggest that Arabidopsis REIL proteins influence cold-induced plant ribosome remodeling and enhance the accumulation of cytosolic ribosome subunits after cold shift either by de novo synthesis or by recycling them from the translating ribosome fraction.</p>

Alternative Oxidase Isoforms Are Differentially Activated by Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle Intermediates
<p>The cyanide-insensitive alternative oxidase (AOX) is a non-proton-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>ing ubiquinol oxidase that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water and is posttranslationally regulated by redox mechanisms and 2-oxo acids. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) possesses five AOX isoforms (AOX1A–AOX1D and AOX2). AOX1D expression is increased in <i>aox1a</i> knockout mutants from Arabidopsis (especially after restriction of the cytochrome <i>c</i> pathway) but cannot compensate for the lack of AOX1A, suggesting a difference in the regulation of these isoforms. Therefore, we analyzed the different AOX isoenzymes with the aim to identify differences in their posttranslational regulation. Seven tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (citrate, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate) were tested for their influence on AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D wild-type protein activity using a refined in vitro system. AOX1C is insensitive to all seven organic acids, AOX1A and AOX1D are both activated by 2-oxoglutarate, but only AOX1A is additionally activated by oxaloacetate. Furthermore, AOX isoforms cannot be transformed to mimic one another by substituting the variable cysteine residues at position III in the protein. In summary, we show that AOX isoforms from Arabidopsis are differentially fine-regulated by tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites (most likely depending on the amino-terminal region around the highly conserved cysteine residues known to be involved in regulation by the 2-oxo acids pyruvate and glyoxylate) and propose that this is the main reason why they cannot functionally compensate for each other.</p>

The SlCBL10 Calcineurin B-Like Protein Ensures Plant Growth under Salt Stress by Regulating Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> Homeostasis<sup>1</sup>
<p>Characterization of a new tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) T-DNA mutant allowed for the isolation of the <i>CALCINEURIN B-LIKE PROTEIN 10</i> (<i>SlCBL10</i>) gene whose lack of function was responsible for the severe alterations observed in the shoot apex and reproductive organs under salinity conditions. Physiological studies proved that <i>SlCBL10</i> gene is required to maintain a proper low Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> ratio in growing tissues allowing tomato growth under salt stress. Expression analysis of the main responsible genes for Na<sup>+</sup> compartmentalization (i.e. <i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> EXCHANGERs</i>, <i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE</i>, <i>HIGH-AFFINITY K+ TRANSPORTER 1;2</i>, <i>H<sup>+</sup>-pyrophosphatase AVP1</i> [<i>SlAVP1</i>] and V-ATPase [<i>SlVHA-A1</i>]) supported a reduced capacity to accumulate Na<sup>+</sup> in <i>Slcbl10</i> mutant leaves, which resulted in a lower uploading of Na<sup>+</sup> from xylem, allowing the toxic ion to reach apex and flowers. Likewise, the tomato <i>CATION EXCHANGER 1</i> and <i>TWO-PORE CHANNEL 1</i> (<i>SlTPC1</i>), key genes for Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes to the vacuole, showed abnormal expression in <i>Slcbl10</i> plants indicating an impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from vacuole. Additionally, complementation assay revealed that <i>SlCBL10</i> is a true ortholog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>CBL10</i> gene, supporting that the essential function of CBL10 is conserved in Arabidopsis and tomato. Together, the findings obtained in this study provide new insights into the function of <i>SlCBL10</i> in salt stress tolerance. Thus, it is proposed that SlCBL10 mediates salt tolerance by regulating Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes in the vacuole, cooperating with the vacuolar cation channel <i>SlTPC1</i> and the two vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong>s, <i>SlAVP1</i> and <i>SlVHA-A1</i>, which in turn are revealed as potential targets of <i>SlCBL10</i>.</p>

Stage-Specific Gene Profiling of Germinal Cells Helps Delineate the Mitosis/Meiosis Transition
<p>In flowering plants, germ lines are induced from somatic meristems within reproductive organs. Within anthers, germinal cell initials first undergo several rounds of mitotic proliferation before synchronously entering meiosis. Our understanding of the progression and the molecular basis of this mitosis to meiosis transition is still limited. Taking advantage of the correlation between anther length and premeiotic germinal cell development in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we studied the transcriptome dynamics of germinal cells at three sequential stages, mitotic archesporial cells, enlarging pollen mother cells at the premeiosis interphase, and pollen mother cells at the early prophase of meiosis, using laser microdissection-based expression profiling. Our analysis showed that cells undergoing the mitosis-meiosis switch exhibit robust transcriptional changes. The three stages are distinguished by the expression of genes encoding transcription factor subsets, meiotic chromosome recombination proteins, and distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, respectively. The transcription level of genes encoding protein turnover machinery was significantly higher in these three stages of germinal cells than in mature pollen, parenchyma cells, or seedlings. Our experimental results further indicate that many meiotic genes are not only transcribed, but also translated prior to meiosis. We suggest that the enlarging pollen mother cells stage represents a crucial turning point from mitosis to meiosis for developing germinal cells.</p>

The Kinase OsCPK4 Regulates a Buffering Mechanism That Fine-Tunes Innate Immunity
<p>The calcium-dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 has been demonstrated to play important roles in salt and drought tolerance, plant growth, and development in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). However, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying OsCPK4 function in rice immunity. In this study, we demonstrated that the generation of oxidative burst and pathogenesis-related gene expression triggered by microbe-associated molecular patterns were significantly enhanced in the <i>oscpk4</i> mutants. These mutant lines are more resistant to bacterial blight and fungal blast diseases than the wild-type plants, indicating that OsCPK4 negatively regulates innate immunity in rice. OsCPK4 was further identified to interact with a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase OsRLCK176. OsRLCK176 accumulation is negatively regulated by OsCPK4. Interestingly, the kinase-dead OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation more strongly than the wild-type protein. OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 mutually phosphorylate each other and form a feedback loop. Moreover, the kinase activity and phosphorylation of OsCPK4 and OsRLCK176 contribute to the stability of OsRLCK176. These findings indicate that the kinase-inactive OsCPK4 promotes OsRLCK176 degradation and restricts plant defenses, whereas the activation of OsCPK4-OsRLCK176 phosphorylation circuit invalidates the OsRLCK176 degradation machinery, thus enhancing plant immunity. Collectively, the study proposes a novel defense buffering mechanism mediated by OsCPK4, which fine-tunes microbe-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity in rice.</p>

Argonaute 8 (AGO8) Mediates the Elicitation of Direct Defenses against Herbivory

However, the identity and role(s) of Argonautes (AGOs) involved in herbivory remain unknown. Of the 11 AGOs in the <i>N. attenuata</i> genome, we silenced the expression of 10. Plants silenced in <i>NaAGO8</i> expression grew normally but were highly susceptible to herbivore attack. Larvae of <i>Manduca sexta</i> grew faster when consuming inverted-repeat stable transformants (ir<i>AGO8</i>) plants but did not differ from the wild type when consuming plants silenced in <i>AGO1</i> (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>), <i>AGO2</i>, <i>AGO4</i> (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>), <i>AGO7</i>, or <i>AGO10</i> expression. ir<i>AGO8</i> plants were significantly compromised in herbivore-induced levels of defense metabolites such as nicotine, phenolamides, and diterpenoid glycosides. Time-course analyses revealed extensively altered microRNA profiles and the reduced accumulation of <i>MYB8</i> transcripts and of the associated genes of the phenolamide and phenylpropanoid pathways as well as the nicotine biosynthetic pathway. A possible AGO8-modulated microRNA-messenger RNA target network was inferred. Furthermore, comparative analysis of domains revealed the diversity of AGO conformations, particularly in the small RNA-binding pocket, which may influence substrate recognition/binding and functional specificity. We infer that AGO8 plays a central role in the induction of direct defenses by modulating several regulatory nodes in the defense signaling network during herbivore response. Thus, our study identifies the effector AGO of the herbivore-induced small RNA machinery, which in <i>N. attenuata</i> now comprises RdR1, DCL3/4, and AGO8.</p>

The B vitamins give rise to vital coenzymes that are indispensable for growth and development but their inherent reactive nature renders them prone to destruction especially under stress conditions. Therefore, plant survival strategies would be expected to include mechanisms to sustain B vitamin supply under demanding circumstances. Here, using the example of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, we investigate the regulation of biosynthesis across eudicot and monocot species under heat stress. Most eudicots carry a pseudoenzyme PDX1.2 that is a noncatalytic homolog of the PDX1 subunit of the vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis protein machinery, PYRIDOXINE BIOSYNTHESIS PROTEIN1. Using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) as models, we show that <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> is transcriptionally regulated by the HSFA1 transcription factor family. Monocots only carry catalytic <i>PDX1</i> homologs that do not respond to heat stress as demonstrated for rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), suggesting fundamental differences in the regulation of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> biosynthesis across the two lineages. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of <i>PDX1</i>.<i>2</i> transcription reveals two alternative transcriptional start sites, one of which is exclusive to heat stress. Further data suggest that PDX1.2 leads to stabilization of the catalytic PDX1s under heat stress conditions, which would serve to maintain vitamin B<sub>6</sub> homeostasis in times of need in eudicots that carry this gene. Our analyses indicate an important abiotic stress tolerance strategy in several eudicots, which has not been evolutionarily adapted (or is not required) by monocots such as grasses.</p>

Heat Shock Protein HSP101 Affects the Release of Ribosomal Protein mRNAs for Recovery after Heat Shock
<p>Heat shock (HS) is known to have a profound impact on gene expression at different levels, such as inhibition of protein synthesis, in which HS blocks translation initiation and induces the sequestration of mRNAs into stress granules (SGs) or P-bodies for storage and/or decay. SGs prevent the degradation of the stored mRNAs, which can be reengaged into translation in the recovery period. However, little is known on the mRNAs stored during the stress, how these mRNAs are released from SGs afterward, and what the functional importance is of this process. In this work, we report that Arabidopsis <i>HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN101</i> (<i>HSP101</i>) knockout mutant (<i>hsp101</i>) presented a defect in translation recovery and SG dissociation after HS. Using RNA sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation approaches, we show that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) were preferentially stored during HS and that these mRNAs were released and translated in an HSP101-dependent manner during recovery. By <sup>15</sup>N incorporation and polysome profile analyses, we observed that these released mRNAs contributed to the production of new ribosomes to enhance translation. We propose that, after HS, HSP101 is required for the efficient release of RP mRNAs from SGs resulting in a rapid restoration of the translation machinery by producing new RPs.</p>

Temperature-Induced Remodeling of the Photosynthetic Machinery Tunes Photosynthesis in the Thermophilic Alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i>
<p>The thermophilic alga <i>C. merolae</i> thrives in extreme environments (low pH and temperature between 40°C and 56°C). In this study, we investigated the acclimation process of the alga to a colder temperature (25°C). A long-term cell growth experiment revealed an extensive remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus in the first 250 h of acclimation, which was followed by cell growth to an even higher density than the control (grown at 42°C) cell density. Once the cells were shifted to the lower temperature, the proteins of the light-harvesting antenna were greatly down-regulated and the phycobilisome composition was altered. The amount of PSI and PSII subunits was also decreased, but the chlorophyll to photosystems ratio remained unchanged. The 25°C cells possessed a less efficient photon-to-oxygen conversion rate and require a 2.5 times higher light intensity to reach maximum photosynthetic efficiency. With respect to chlorophyll, however, the photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate of the 25°C culture was 2 times higher than the control. Quantitative proteomics revealed that acclimation requires, besides remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus, also adjustment of the machinery for protein folding, degradation, and homeostasis. In summary, these remodeling processes tuned photosynthesis according to the demands placed on the system and revealed the capability of <i>C. merolae</i> to grow under a broad range of temperatures.</p>

Localization and in-Vivo Characterization of <i>Thapsia garganica</i> CYP76AE2 Indicates a Role in Thapsigargin Biosynthesis
<p>The Mediterranean plant <i>Thapsia garganica</i> (dicot, Apiaceae), also known as deadly carrot, produces the highly toxic compound thapsigargin. This compound is a potent inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> in mammals and is of industrial importance as the active moiety of the anticancer drug mipsagargin, currently in clinical trials. Knowledge of thapsigargin in planta storage and biosynthesis has been limited. Here, we present the putative second step in thapsigargin biosynthesis, by showing that the cytochrome P450 TgCYP76AE2, transiently expressed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, converts epikunzeaol into epidihydrocostunolide. Furthermore, we show that thapsigargin is likely to be stored in secretory ducts in the roots. Transcripts from TgTPS2 (epikunzeaol synthase) and TgCYP76AE2 in roots were found only in the epithelial cells lining these secretory ducts. This emphasizes the involvement of these cells in the biosynthesis of thapsigargin. This study paves the way for further studies of thapsigargin biosynthesis.</p>

A Novel Chemical Inhibitor of ABA Signaling Targets All ABA Receptors
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA), the most important stress-induced phytohormone, regulates seed dormancy, germination, plant senescence, and the abiotic stress response. ABA signaling is repressed by group A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), and then ABA binds to its receptor of the ACTIN RESISTANCE1 (PYR1), PYR1-LIKE (PYL), and REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS (RCAR) family, which, in turn, inhibits PP2Cs and activates downstream ABA signaling. The agonist/antagonist of ABA receptors have the potential to reveal the ABA signaling machinery and to become lead compounds for agrochemicals; however, until now, no broad-spectrum antagonists of ABA receptors blocking all PYR/PYL-PP2C interactions have been identified. Here, using chemical genetics screenings, we identified ABA ANTAGONIST1 (AA1), the first broad-spectrum antagonist of ABA receptors in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Physiological analyses revealed that AA1 is sufficiently active to block ABA signaling. AA1 interfered with all the PYR/PYL-HAB1 interactions, and the diminished PYR/PYL-HAB1 interactions, in turn, restored the activity of HAB1. AA1 binds to all 13 members. Molecular dockings, the non-AA1-bound PYL2 variant, and competitive binding assays demonstrated that AA1 enters into the ligand-binding pocket of PYL2. Using AA1, we tested the genetic relationships of ABA receptors with other core components of ABA signaling, demonstrating that AA1 is a powerful tool with which to sidestep this genetic redundancy of PYR/PYLs. In addition, the application of AA1 delays leaf senescence. Thus, our study developed an efficient broad-spectrum antagonist of ABA receptors and demonstrated that plant senescence can be chemically controlled through AA1, with a simple and easy-to-synthesize structure, allowing its availability and utility as a chemical probe synthesized in large quantities, indicating its potential application in agriculture.</p>

5′ to 3′ mRNA Decay Contributes to the Regulation of Arabidopsis Seed Germination by Dormancy
<p>The regulation of plant gene expression, necessary for development and adaptive responses, relies not only on RNA transcription but also on messenger RNA (mRNA) fate. To understand whether seed germination relies on the degradation of specific subsets of mRNA, we investigated whether the 5′ to 3′ RNA decay machinery participated in the regulation of this process. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds of <i>exoribonuclease4</i> (<i>xrn4</i>) and <i>varicose</i> (<i>vcs</i>) mutants displayed distinct dormancy phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis <i>of xrn4-5</i> and <i>vcs-8</i> mutant seeds allowed us to identify genes that are likely to play a role in the control of germination. Study of 5′ untranslated region features of these transcripts revealed that specific motifs, secondary energy, and GC content could play a role in their degradation by XRN4 and VCS, and Gene Ontology clustering revealed novel actors of seed dormancy and germination. Several specific transcripts identified as being putative targets of XRN4 and VCS in seeds (<i>PECTIN LYASE-LIKE</i>, <i>ASPARTYL PROTEASE</i>, <i>DWD-HYPERSENSITIVE-TO-ABA3</i>, and <i>YELLOW STRIPE-LIKE5</i>) were further studied by reverse genetics, and their functional roles in the germination process were confirmed by mutant analysis. These findings suggest that completion of germination and its regulation by dormancy also depend on the degradation of specific subsets of mRNA.</p>

Comparative Analysis of Light-Harvesting Antennae and State Transition in <i>chlorina</i> and cpSRP Mutants
<p>State transitions in photosynthesis provide for the dynamic allocation of a mobile fraction of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) to photosystem II (PSII) in state I and to photosystem I (PSI) in state II. In the state I-to-state II transition, LHCII is phosphorylated by STN7 and associates with PSI to favor absorption cross-section of PSI. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with defects in chlorophyll (Chl) b biosynthesis or in the chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) machinery to study the flexible formation of PS-LHC supercomplexes. Intriguingly, we found that impaired Chl b biosynthesis in <i>chlorina1-2</i> (<i>ch1-2</i>) led to preferentially stabilized LHCI rather than LHCII, while the contents of both LHCI and LHCII were equally depressed in the cpSRP43-deficient mutant (<i>chaos</i>). In view of recent findings on the modified state transitions in LHCI-deficient mutants (Benson et al., 2015), the <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> mutants were used to assess the influence of varying LHCI/LHCII antenna size on state transitions. Under state II conditions, LHCII-PSI supercomplexes were not formed in both <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> plants. LHCII phosphorylation was drastically reduced in <i>ch1-2</i>, and the inactivation of STN7 correlates with the lack of state transitions. In contrast, phosphorylated LHCII in <i>chaos</i> was observed to be exclusively associated with PSII complexes, indicating a lack of mobile LHCII in <i>chaos</i>. Thus, the comparative analysis of <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> mutants provides new evidence for the flexible organization of LHCs and enhances our understanding of the reversible allocation of LHCII to the two photosystems.</p>

Sequential Duplications of an Ancient Member of the DnaJ-Family Expanded the Functional Chaperone Network in the Eukaryotic Cytosol
<p>Across eukaryotes, Hsp70-based chaperone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">machineri</span></strong>es display an underlying unity in their sequence, structure, and biochemical mechanism of action, while working in a myriad of cellular processes. In good part, this extraordinary functional versatility is derived from the ability of a single Hsp70 to interact with an array of J-protein cochaperones to form a functional chaperone network. Among J-proteins, the DnaJ-type is the most prevalent, being present in all three kingdoms and in several different compartments of eukaryotic cells. However, because these ancient DnaJ-type proteins diverged at the base of the eukaryotic phylogeny, little is understood about the evolutionary basis of their diversification and thus the functional expansion of the chaperone network. Here, we report results of evolutionary and experimental analyses of two more recent members of the cytosolic DnaJ family of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Xdj1 and Apj1, which emerged by sequential duplications of the ancient <i>YDJ1</i> in Ascomycota. Sequence comparison and molecular modeling revealed that both Xdj1 and Apj1 maintained a domain organization similar to that of multifunctional Ydj1. However, despite these similarities, both Xdj1 and Apj1 evolved highly specialized functions. Xdj1 plays a unique role in the translocation of proteins from the cytosol into mitochondria. Apj1’s specialized role is related to degradation of sumolyated proteins. Together these data provide the first clear example of cochaperone duplicates that evolved specialized functions, allowing expansion of the chaperone functional network, while maintaining the overall structural organization of their parental gene.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the intestine generates luminal carbonate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

Elevated expression of the V-ATPase C subunit triggers JNK-dependent cell invasion and overgrowth in a <i>Drosophila</i> epithelium
<p>The C subunit of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase or V-ATPase regulates the activity and assembly of the proton <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pump</span></strong> at cellular membranes. It has been shown to be strongly upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma, a highly metastatic epithelial cancer. In addition, increased V-ATPase activity appears to correlate with invasiveness of cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Using the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal epithelium as an <i>in vivo</i> model system, we demonstrate that overexpression of Vha44, the <i>Drosophila</i> orthologue of the C subunit, causes a tumor-like tissue transformation in cells of the wing epithelium. Overexpressing cells are excluded from the epithelium and acquire invasive properties while displaying high apoptotic rates. Blocking apoptosis in these cells unmasks a strong proliferation stimulus, leading to overgrowth. Furthermore, we show that excess Vha44 greatly increases acidification of endocytic compartments and interferes with endosomal trafficking. As a result, cargoes such as GFP-Lamp1 and Notch accumulate in highly acidified enlarged endolysosomal compartments. Consistent with previous reports on the endocytic activation of Eiger/JNK signaling, we find that V-ATPase stimulation by Vha44 causes JNK signaling activation whereas downmodulation of JNK signaling rescues the invasive phenotypes. In summary, our <i>in vivo-</i>findings demonstrate that increased levels of V-ATPase C subunit induce a Eiger/JNK-dependent cell transformation within an epithelial organ that recapitulates early carcinoma stages.</p>

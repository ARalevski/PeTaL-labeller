Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al types found in leaves: amorphous calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als and the control that the leaf exerts over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>als, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al distribution that is preserved in different environments. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

Remobilization of crustal carbon may dominate volcanic arc emissions
<p>The flux of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> into and out of Earth’s surface environment has implications for Earth’s climate and habitability. We compiled a global data set for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> and helium isotopes from volcanic arcs and demonstrated that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> isotope composition of mean global volcanic gas is considerably heavier, at –3.8 to –4.6 per mil (‰), than the canonical mid-ocean ridge basalt value of –6.0‰. The largest volcanic emitters outgas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> with higher δ<sup>13</sup>C and are located in mature continental arcs that have accreted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate platforms, indicating that reworking of crustal limestone is an important source of volcanic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>. The fractional burial of organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> is lower than traditionally determined from a global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> isotope mass balance and may have varied over geological time, modulated by supercontinent formation and breakup.</p>

Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century
<p>Soil is the largest terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycle–climate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sink by 2100, yet the underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used <sup>14</sup>C data from 157 globally distributed soil profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> by a factor of more than six (430 ± 50 years versus 3100 ± 1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sequestration potential of soils by a factor of nearly two (40 ± 27%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dioxide dynamics.</p>

Long-term pattern and magnitude of soil carbon feedback to the climate system in a warming world
<p>In a 26-year soil warming experiment in a mid-latitude hardwood forest, we documented changes in soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycling to investigate the potential consequences for the climate system. We found that soil warming results in a four-phase pattern of soil organic matter decay and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere, with phases of substantial soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> loss alternating with phases of no detectable loss. Several factors combine to affect the timing, magnitude, and thermal acclimation of soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> loss. These include depletion of microbially accessible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> pools, reductions in microbial biomass, a shift in microbial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> use efficiency, and changes in microbial community composition. Our results support projections of a long-term, self-reinforcing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> feedback from mid-latitude forests to the climate system as the world warms.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>s lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-efficient metabolism alongside the fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

Contrasting carbon cycle responses of the tropical continents to the 2015–2016 El Niño
<p>The 2015–2016 El Niñño led to historically high temperatures and low precipitation over the tropics, while the growth rate of atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) was the largest on record. Here we quantify the response of tropical net biosphere exchange, gross primary production, biomass burning, and respiration to these climate anomalies by assimilating column CO<sub>2</sub>, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> monoxide observations from multiple satellites. Relative to the 2011 La Niññña, the pantropical biosphere released 2.5 ± 0.34 gigatons more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> into the atmosphere in 2015, consisting of approximately even contributions from three tropical continents but dominated by diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> exchange processes. The heterogeneity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-exchange processes indicated here challenges previous studies that suggested that a single dominant process determines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycle interannual variability.</p>

Tropical forests are a net carbon source based on aboveground measurements of gain and loss
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> balance of tropical ecosystems remains uncertain, with top-down atmospheric studies suggesting an overall sink and bottom-up ecological approaches indicating a modest net source. Here we use 12 years (2003 to 2014) of MODIS pantropical satellite data to quantify net annual changes in the aboveground <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> density of tropical woody live vegetation, providing direct, measurement-based evidence that the world’s tropical forests are a net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> source of 425.2<bold> </bold>± 92.0 teragrams of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> per year (Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). This net release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> consists of losses of 861.7 ± 80.2 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup> and gains of 436.5 ± 31.0 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>. Gains result from forest growth; losses result from deforestation and from reductions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> density within standing forests (degradation or disturbance), with the latter accounting for 68.9% of overall losses.</p>

Carbon nanotube transistors scaled to a 40-nanometer footprint
<p>The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors challenges the device research community to reduce the transistor footprint containing all components to 40 nanometers within the next decade. We report on a p-channel transistor scaled to such an extremely small dimension. Built on one semiconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>e, it occupies less than half the space of leading silicon technologies, while delivering a significantly higher pitch-normalized current density—above 0.9 milliampere per micrometer at a low supply voltage of 0.5 volts with a subthreshold swing of 85 millivolts per decade. Furthermore, we show transistors with the same small footprint built on actual high-density arrays of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>es that deliver higher current than that of the best-competing silicon devices under the same overdrive, without any normalization. We achieve this using low-resistance end-bonded contacts, a high-purity semiconducting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>e source, and self-assembly to pack <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>es into full surface-coverage aligned arrays.</p>

Faster Decomposition Under Increased Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Limits Soil Carbon Storage
<sec><title>Increasing Turnover</title><p>Rising concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere are likely to stimulate plant growth, leading to increased biomass and soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> stocks, thereby lessening the rate of the rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. <bold>Van Groenigen <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 508, published online 24 April) report the results of a meta-analysis and modeling that show that increasing the concentration of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> also stimulates microbial decomposition of organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> in soils, by roughly the same amount that it increases soil organic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>, leading to lower equilibrium soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> inventories and limiting the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>.

Prognostic Value of Coronary Artery Calcium in the PROMISE Study (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is an established predictor of future major adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals. However, limited data exist as to how CAC compares with functional testing (FT) in estimating prognosis in symptomatic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain (or dyspnea) and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease were randomized to FT (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or anatomic testing. We evaluated those who underwent CAC testing as part of the anatomic evaluation (n=4209) and compared that with results of FT (n=4602). We stratified CAC and FT results as normal or mildly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moder</span></strong>ately, or severely abnormal (for CAC: 0, 1–99 Agatston score [AS], 100–400 AS, and >400 AS, respectively; for FT: normal, mild=late positive treadmill, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moder</span></strong>ate=early positive treadmill or single-vessel ischemia, and severe=large ischemic region abnormality).

In the CAC arm, the majority of events (n=112 of 133, 84%) occurred in patients with any positive CAC test (score >0), whereas fewer than half of events occurred in patients with mildly, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moder</span></strong>ately, or severely abnormal FT (n=57 of 132, 43%; <i>P</i><0.001). In contrast, any abnormality on FT was significantly more specific for predicting events (78.6% for FT versus 35.2% for CAC; <i>P</i><0.001). Overall discriminatory ability in predicting the primary end point of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina hospitalization was similar and fair for both CAC and FT (C statistic, 0.67 versus 0.64).

Interplay of growth rate and xylem plasticity for optimal coordination of carbon and hydraulic economies in <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> trees
<p>Efficient leaf water supply is fundamental for assimilation processes and tree growth. Renovating the architecture of the xylem transport system requires an increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> investment while growing taller, and any deficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> availability may result in increasing hydraulic constraints to water flow. Therefore, plants need to coordinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> assimilation and biomass allocation to guarantee an efficient and safe long-distance transport system. We tested the hypothesis that reduced branch elongation rates together with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-saving adjustments of xylem anatomy hydraulically compensate for the reduction in biomass allocation to xylem. We measured leaf biomass, hydraulic and anatomical properties of wood segments along the main axis of branches in 10 slow growing (SG) and 10 fast growing (FG) <i>Fraxinus ornus</i> L. trees. Branches of SG trees had five times slower branch elongation rate (7 vs 35  cm year<sup>–1</sup>), and produced a higher leaf biomass (<i>P</i> < 0.0001) and thinner xylem rings with fewer but larger vessels (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). On the contrary, we found no differences between SG and FG trees in terms of leaf-specific conductivity (<i>P</i> > 0.05) and xylem safety (Ψ<sub>50</sub> ≈ −3.2  MPa). Slower elongation rate coupled with thinner annual rings and larger vessels allows the reduction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> costs associated with growth, while maintaining similar leaf-specific conductivity and xylem safety.</p>

Photonic crystals for nano-light in moiré graphene superlattices

Fractal-like hierarchical organization of bone begins at the nanoscale

However, the organization and relationship between bone’s principal components—<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al and collagen—has not been clearly elucidated.

On the basis of these observations, we present a structural model of hierarchy and continuity for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al phase, which contributes to the structural integrity of bone.</p>

Organometallic and radical intermediates reveal mechanism of diphthamide biosynthesis
<p>Diphthamide biosynthesis involves a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> bond-forming reaction catalyzed by a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme that cleaves a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-sulfur (C–S) bond in SAM to generate a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) radical. Using rapid freezing, we have captured an organometallic intermediate with an iron-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> (Fe–C) bond between ACP and the enzyme’s [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the presence of the substrate protein, elongation factor 2, this intermediate converts to an organic radical, formed by addition of the ACP radical to a histidine side chain. Crystal structures of archaeal diphthamide biosynthetic radical SAM enzymes reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> of the SAM C–S bond being cleaved is positioned near the unique cluster Fe, able to react with the cluster. Our results explain how selective C–S bond cleavage is achieved in this radical SAM enzyme.</p>

CNTPs block anion transport, even at salinities that exceed seawater levels, and their ion selectivity can be tuned to configure them into switchable ionic diodes.

Radical-polar crossover reactions of vinylboron ate complexes
<p>Vinyl boronic esters are valuable substrates for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. However, boron-substituted alkenes have drawn little attention as radical acceptors, and the radical chemistry of vinylboron ate complexes is underexplored. We show here that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> radicals add efficiently to vinylboron ate complexes and that their adduct radical anions undergo radical-polar crossover: A 1,2-alkyl/aryl shift from boron to the α-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sp<sup>2</sup> center provides secondary or tertiary alkyl boronic esters. In contrast to the Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, a transition metal is not required, and two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> bonds are formed. The valuable boronic ester moiety remains in the product and can be used in follow-up chemistry, enlarging the chemical space of the method. The cascade uses commercial starting materials and provides access to perfluoroalkylated alcohols, γ-lactones, γ-hydroxy alkylnitriles, and compounds bearing quaternary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> centers.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moder</span></strong>ate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Carbon Supply and Photoacclimation Cross Talk in the Green Alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>
<p>Photosynthetic organisms are exposed to drastic changes in light conditions, which can affect their photosynthetic efficiency and induce photodamage. To face these changes, they have developed a series of acclimation mechanisms. In this work, we have studied the acclimation strategies of <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, a model green alga that can grow using various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> sources and is thus an excellent system in which to study photosynthesis. Like other photosynthetic algae, it has evolved inducible mechanisms to adapt to conditions where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> supply is limiting. We have analyzed how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> availability influences the composition and organization of the photosynthetic apparatus and the capacity of the cells to acclimate to different light conditions. Using electron microscopy, biochemical, and fluorescence measurements, we show that differences in CO<sub>2</sub> availability not only have a strong effect on the induction of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-concentrating mechanisms but also change the acclimation strategy of the cells to light. For example, while cells in limiting CO<sub>2</sub> maintain a large antenna even in high light and switch on energy-dissipative mechanisms, cells in high CO<sub>2</sub> reduce the amount of pigments per cell and the antenna size. Our results show the high plasticity of the photosynthetic apparatus of <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. This alga is able to use various photoacclimation strategies, and the choice of which to activate strongly depends on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> availability.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moder</span></strong>ate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> use for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Entropy-driven stability of chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes
<p>Single-walled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>es are hollow cylinders that can grow centimeters long via <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> incorporation at the interface with a catalyst. They display semiconducting or metallic characteristics, depending on their helicity, which is determined during their growth. To support the quest for a selective synthesis, we develop a thermodynamic model that relates the tube-catalyst interfacial energies, temperature, and the resulting tube chirality. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>es can grow chiral because of the configurational entropy of their nanometer-sized edge, thus explaining experimentally observed temperature evolutions of chiral distributions. Taking the chemical nature of the catalyst into account through interfacial energies, we derive structural maps and phase diagrams that will guide a rational choice of a catalyst and growth parameters toward a better selectivity.</p>

Major role of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in dark ocean carbon fixation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> fixation by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the dark ocean has a major impact on global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycling and ecological relationships in the ocean’s interior, but the relevant taxa and energy sources remain enigmatic. We show evidence that nitrite-oxidizing bacteria affiliated with the Nitrospinae phylum are important in dark ocean chemoautotrophy. Single-cell genomics and community metagenomics revealed that Nitrospinae are the most abundant and globally distributed nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in the ocean. Metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics analyses suggest that nitrite oxidation is the main pathway of energy production in Nitrospinae. Microautoradiography, linked with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization, indicated that Nitrospinae fix 15 to 45% of inorganic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> in the mesopelagic western North Atlantic. Nitrite oxidation may have a greater impact on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycle than previously assumed.</p>

Direct atomic-level insight into the active sites of a high-performance PGM-free ORR catalyst
<p>Platinum group metal–free (PGM-free) metal-nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> catalysts have emerged as a promising alternative to their costly platinum (Pt)–based counterparts in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) but still face some major challenges, including (i) the identification of the most relevant catalytic site for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and (ii) demonstration of competitive PEFC performance under automotive-application conditions in the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)–air fuel cell. Herein, we demonstrate H<sub>2</sub>-air performance gains achieved with an iron-nitrogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> catalyst synthesized with two nitrogen precursors that developed hierarchical porosity. Current densities recorded in the kinetic region of cathode operation, at fuel cell voltages greater than ~0.75 V, were the same as those obtained with a Pt cathode at a loading of 0.1 milligram of Pt per centimeter squared. The proposed catalytic active site, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-embedded nitrogen-coordinated iron (FeN<sub>4</sub>), was directly visualized with aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, and the contributions of these active sites associated with specific lattice-level <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> structures were explored computationally.</p>

Atomic-layered Au clusters on α-MoC as catalysts for the low-temperature water-gas shift reaction
<p>The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction (where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> monoxide plus water yields dihydrogen and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> dioxide) is an essential process for hydrogen generation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> monoxide removal in various energy-related chemical operations. This equilibrium-limited reaction is favored at a low working temperature. Potential application in fuel cells also requires a WGS catalyst to be highly active, stable, and energy-efficient and to match the working temperature of on-site hydrogen generation and consumption units. We synthesized layered gold (Au) clusters on a molybdenum carbide (α-MoC) substrate to create an interfacial catalyst system for the ultralow-temperature WGS reaction. Water was activated over α-MoC at 303 kelvin, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> monoxide adsorbed on adjacent Au sites was apt to react with surface hydroxyl groups formed from water splitting, leading to a high WGS activity at low temperatures.</p>

High-harmonic generation in graphene enhanced by elliptically polarized light excitation

The HHG in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser excitation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids.

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate secretion by the intestine generates luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>ate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

OCO-2 advances photosynthesis observation from space via solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence
<p>Quantifying gross primary production (GPP) remains a major challenge in global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycle research. Spaceborne monitoring of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an integrative photosynthetic signal of molecular origin, can assist in terrestrial GPP monitoring. However, the extent to which SIF tracks spatiotemporal variations in GPP remains unresolved. Orbiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> Observatory-2 (OCO-2)’s SIF data acquisition and fine spatial resolution permit direct validation against ground and airborne observations. Empirical orthogonal function analysis shows consistent spatiotemporal correspondence between OCO-2 SIF and GPP globally. A linear SIF-GPP relationship is also obtained at eddy-flux sites covering diverse biomes, setting the stage for future investigations of the robustness of such a relationship across more biomes. Our findings support the central importance of high-quality satellite SIF for studying terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> cycle dynamics.</p>

Structure and assembly mechanism of plant C<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>M<sub>2</sub>-type PSII-LHCII supercomplex
<p>In plants, the photosynthetic machinery photosystem II (PSII) consists of a core complex associated with variable numbers of light-harvesting complexes II (LHCIIs). The supercomplex, comprising a dimeric core and two strongly bound and two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moder</span></strong>ately bound LHCIIs (C<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>M<sub>2</sub>), is the dominant form in plants acclimated to limited light. Here we report cryo–electron microscopy structures of two forms of C<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>M<sub>2</sub> (termed stacked and unstacked) from <i>Pisum sativum</i> at 2.7- and 3.2-angstrom resolution, respectively. In each C<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>M<sub>2</sub>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moder</span></strong>ately bound LHCII assembles specifically with a peripheral antenna complex CP24-CP29 heterodimer and the strongly bound LHCII, to establish a pigment network that facilitates light harvesting at the periphery and energy transfer into the core. The high mobility of peripheral antennae, including the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">moder</span></strong>ately bound LHCII and CP24, provides insights into functional regulation of plant PSII.</p>

Ruthenium-catalyzed insertion of adjacent diol carbon atoms into C-C bonds: Entry to type II polyketides
<p>Current catalytic processes involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> bond activation rely on π-unsaturated coupling partners. Exploiting the concept of transfer hydrogenative coupling, we report a ruthenium(0)-catalyzed cycloaddition of benzocyclobutenones that functionalizes two adjacent saturated diol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-hydrogen bonds. These regio- and diastereoselective processes enable convergent construction of type II polyketide substructures.</p>

Two-dimensional sp<sup>2</sup> carbon–conjugated covalent organic frameworks
<p>We synthesized a two-dimensional (2D) crystalline covalent organic framework (sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF) that was designed to be fully π-conjugated and constructed from all sp<sup>2</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>s by C=C condensation reactions of tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene and 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile. The C=C linkages topologically connect pyrene knots at regular intervals into a 2D lattice with π conjugations extended along both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions and develop an eclipsed layer framework rather than the more conventionally obtained disordered structures. The sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF is a semiconductor with a discrete band gap of 1.9 electron volts and can be chemically oxidized to enhance conductivity by 12 orders of magnitude. The generated radicals are confined on the pyrene knots, enabling the formation of a paramagnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> structure with high spin density. The sp<sup>2</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> framework induces ferromagnetic phase transition to develop spin-spin coherence and align spins unidirectionally across the material.</p>

Preventing mussel adhesion using lubricant-infused materials
<p>Mussels are opportunistic macrofouling organisms that can attach to most immersed solid surfaces, leading to serious economic and ecological consequences for the maritime and aquaculture industries. We demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant-infused coatings exhibit very low preferential mussel attachment and ultralow adhesive strengths under both controlled laboratory conditions and in marine field studies. Detailed investigations across multiple length scales—from the molecular-scale characterization of deposited adhesive proteins to nanoscale contact mechanics to macroscale live observations—suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant infusion considerably reduces fouling by deceiving the mechanosensing ability of mussels, deterring secretion of adhesive threads, and decreasing the molecular work of adhesion. Our study demonstrates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lubric</span></strong>ant infusion represents an effective strategy to mitigate marine biofouling and provides insights into the physical mechanisms underlying adhesion prevention.</p>

An on/off Berry phase switch in circular graphene resonators
<p>The phase of a quantum state may not return to its original value after the system’s parameters cycle around a closed path; instead, the wave function may acquire a measurable phase difference called the Berry phase. Berry phases typically have been accessed through interference experiments. Here, we demonstrate an unusual Berry phase–induced spectroscopic feature: a sudden and large increase in the energy of angular-momentum states in circular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e p-n junction resonators when a relatively small critical magnetic field is reached. This behavior results from turning on a π Berry phase associated with the topological properties of Dirac fermions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e. The Berry phase can be switched on and off with small magnetic field changes on the order of 10 millitesla, potentially enabling a variety of optoelectronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e device applications.</p>

Synthesis of a carbon nanobelt
<p>The synthesis of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> nanobelt, comprising a closed loop of fully fused edge-sharing benzene rings, has been an elusive goal in organic chemistry for more than 60 years. Here we report the synthesis of one such compound through iterative Wittig reactions followed by a nickel-mediated aryl-aryl coupling reaction. The cylindrical shape of its belt structure was confirmed by x-ray crystallography, and its fundamental optoelectronic properties were elucidated by ultraviolet-visible absorption, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopic studies, as well as theoretical calculations. This molecule could potentially serve as a seed for the preparation of structurally well-defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>es.</p>

Scaling carbon nanotube complementary transistors to 5-nm gate lengths
<p>High-performance top-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>e field-effect transistors (CNT FETs) with a gate length of 5 nanometers can be fabricated that perform better than silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) FETs at the same scale. A scaling trend study revealed that the scaled CNT-based devices, which use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e contacts, can operate much faster and at much lower supply voltage (0.4 versus 0.7 volts) and with much smaller subthreshold slope (typically 73 millivolts per decade). The 5-nanometer CNT FETs approached the quantum limit of FETs by using only one electron per switching operation. In addition, the contact length of the CNT CMOS devices was also scaled down to 25 nanometers, and a CMOS inverter with a total pitch size of 240 nanometers was also demonstrated.</p>

Permanent human occupation of the central Tibetan Plateau in the early Holocene
<p>Current models of the peopling of the higher-elevation zones of the Tibetan Plateau postulate that permanent occupation could only have been facilitated by an agricultural lifeway at ~3.6 thousand calibrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-14 years before present. Here we report a reanalysis of the chronology of the Chusang site, located on the central Tibetan Plateau at an elevation of ~4270 meters above sea level. The minimum age of the site is fixed at ~7.4 thousand years (thorium-230/uranium dating), with a maximum age between ~8.20 and 12.67 thousand calibrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-14 years before present (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-14 assays). Travel cost modeling and archaeological data suggest that the site was part of an annual, permanent, preagricultural occupation of the central plateau. These findings challenge current models of the occupation of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth’s deep mantle
<p>The redox state of Earth’s convecting mantle, masked by the lithospheric plates and basaltic magmatism of plate tectonics, is a key unknown in the evolutionary history of our planet. Here we report that large, exceptional gem diamonds like the Cullinan, Constellation, and Koh-i-Noor carry direct evidence of crystallization from a redox-sensitive metallic liquid phase in the deep mantle. These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong>-sulfur melt, accompanied by a thin fluid layer of methane ± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former calcium silicate perovskite. The metal-dominated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">miner</span></strong>al assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under metal-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a metallic iron phase that contains dissolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> and hydrogen.</p>

MoS<sub>2</sub> transistors with 1-nanometer gate lengths
<p>Scaling of silicon (Si) transistors is predicted to fail below 5-nanometer (nm) gate lengths because of severe short channel effects. As an alternative to Si, certain layered semiconductors are attractive for their atomically uniform thickness down to a monolayer, lower dielectric constants, larger band gaps, and heavier carrier effective mass. Here, we demonstrate molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) transistors with a 1-nm physical gate length using a single-walled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">carbon</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nanotub</span></strong>e as the gate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">electrod</span></strong>e. These ultrashort devices exhibit excellent switching characteristics with near ideal subthreshold swing of ~65 millivolts per decade and an On/Off current ratio of ~10<sup>6</sup>. Simulations show an effective channel length of ~3.9 nm in the Off state and ~1 nm in the On state.</p>

Electron optics with p-n junctions in ballistic graphene
<p>Electrons transmitted across a ballistic semiconductor junction are expected to undergo refraction, analogous to light rays across an optical boundary. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e, the linear dispersion and zero-gap band structure admit highly transparent p-n junctions by simple electrostatic gating. Here, we employ transverse magnetic focusing to probe the propagation of carriers across an electrostatically defined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e junction. We find agreement with the predicted Snell’s law for electrons, including the observation of both positive and negative refraction. Resonant transmission across the p-n junction provides a direct measurement of the angle-dependent transmission coefficient. Comparing experimental data with simulations reveals the crucial role played by the effective junction width, providing guidance for future device design. Our results pave the way for realizing electron optics based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">graphen</span></strong>e p-n junctions.</p>

Revision anatomical reconstruction of the lateral ligaments of the ankle augmented with suture tape for patients with a failed Broström procedure
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the intermediate-term   outcomes after revision anatomical ankle ligament reconstruction   augmented with suture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tape</span></strong> for a failed modified Broström procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 30 patients with persistent instability of the ankle   after a Broström procedure underwent revision augmented with suture   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tape</span></strong>. Of these, 24 patients who were followed up for more than two   years were included in the study. There were 13 men and 11 women.   Their mean age was 31.8 years (23 to 44). The mean follow-up was 38.5   months (24 to 56) The clinical outcome was assessed using the Foot   and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure   (FAAM) score.

The mean angle of talar tilt and anterior talar   translation improved significantly to 2.8° (0° to 6°) and 4.1 mm   (2 to 7) at final follow-up, respectively (p < 0.001). Side to   side comparison in stress radiographs at final follow-up showed   no significant difference.

Tim-3 signaling in peripheral NK cells promotes maternal-fetal immune tolerance and alleviates pregnancy loss
<p>Pregnancy loss occurs in about 15% of clinically recognized pregnancies, and defective maternal-fetal immune tolerance contributes to more than 50% of these events. We found that signaling by the type I membrane protein T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-containing protein 3 (Tim-3) in natural killer (NK) cells had an essential protective role during early pregnancy. Tim-3 on peripheral NK (pNK) cells was transiently increased in abundance during the first trimester of pregnancy, which depended on interleukin-4 (IL-4)–signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and progesterone signaling. Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells displayed immunosuppressive activities, including the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the induction of regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) in a transforming growth factor–β1 (TGF-β1)–dependent manner. Tim-3 on pNK cells was stimulated by its ligand galectin-9 (Gal-9), leading to signaling by the kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AKT. In recurrent miscarriage (RM) patients, Tim-3 abundance on pNK cells was reduced and the immunosuppressive activity of Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells was impaired. Compared to Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells from donors with normal pregnancies, RM patient Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells exhibited changes in DNA accessibility in certain genetic loci, which were reversed by inhibiting accessible chromatin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reader</span></strong> proteins. Furthermore, Tim-3<sup>+</sup> pNK cells, but not Tim-3<sup>−</sup> pNK cells, reduced fetal loss in abortion-prone and NK cell–deficient mice. Together, our findings reveal a critical role for Tim-3–Gal-9 signaling–mediated immunoregulation by pNK cells in maternal-fetal immune tolerance and suggest that Tim-3 abundance on pNK cells is a potential biomarker for RM diagnosis.</p>

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials
<p>Although flakes of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures at the micrometer scale can be formed with adhesive-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tape</span></strong> exfoliation methods, isolation of 2D flakes into monolayers is extremely time consuming because it is a trial-and-error process. Controlling the number of 2D layers through direct growth also presents difficulty because of the high nucleation barrier on 2D materials. We demonstrate a layer-resolved 2D material splitting technique that permits high-throughput production of multiple monolayers of wafer-scale (5-centimeter diameter) 2D materials by splitting single stacks of thick 2D materials grown on a single wafer. Wafer-scale uniformity of hexagonal boron nitride, tungsten disulfide, tungsten diselenide, molybdenum disulfide, and molybdenum diselenide monolayers was verified by photoluminescence response and by substantial retention of electronic conductivity. We fabricated wafer-scale van der Waals heterostructures, including field-effect transistors, with single-atom thickness resolution.</p>

Multiplex recording of cellular events over time on CRISPR biological tape
<p>Although dynamics underlie many biological processes, our ability to robustly and accurately profile time-varying biological signals and regulatory programs remains limited. Here we describe a framework for storing temporal biological information directly in the genomes of a cell population. We developed a “biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tape</span></strong> recorder” in which biological signals trigger intracellular DNA production that is then recorded by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation system. This approach enables stable recording over multiple days and accurate reconstruction of temporal and lineage information by sequencing CRISPR arrays. We further demonstrate a multiplexing strategy to simultaneously record the temporal availability of three metabolites (copper, trehalose, and fucose) in the environment of a cell population over time. This work enables the temporal measurement of dynamic cellular states and environmental changes and suggests new applications for chronicling biological events on a large scale.</p>

Ebola: A postmortem
<p>In <i>The Politics of Fear, </i>experts and aid workers use personal experience and the organization's archives to examine the course of the West African Ebola epidemic and the factors that drove and sustained it. The book focuses on four critical aspects of the epidemic: the public reaction to the outbreak, the organizations and individuals who responded to it, how care was delivered, and the containment of infection. Although vignettes and case studies are included that provide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reader</span></strong>s with a vivid on-the-ground perspective, it is the book's examination of politics, policies, and decisions that offers critical insight into the epidemic.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Histone Code Reader and a Transcriptional Activator Interact to Regulate Genes for Salt Tolerance
<p>Plant homeodomain (PHD) finger proteins are involved in various developmental processes and stress responses. They recognize and bind to epigenetically modified histone H3 tail and function as histone code <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reader</span></strong>s. Here we report that GmPHD6 reads low methylated histone H3K4me0/1/2 but not H3K4me3 with its N-terminal domain instead of the PHD finger. GmPHD6 does not possess transcriptional regulatory ability but has DNA-binding ability. Through the PHD finger, GmPHD6 interacts with its coactivator, LHP1-1/2, to form a transcriptional activation complex. Using a transgenic hairy root system, we demonstrate that overexpression of <i>GmPHD6</i> improves stress tolerance in soybean (<i>Glycine</i> <i>max</i>) plants. Knocking down the <i>LHP1</i> expression disrupts this role of <i>GmPHD6</i>, indicating that GmPHD6 requires LHP1 functions during stress response. GmPHD6 influences expression of dozens of stress-related genes. Among these, we identified three targets of GmPHD6, including ABA-stress-ripening-induced <i>CYP75B1</i> and <i>CYP82C4</i>. Overexpression of each gene confers stress tolerance in soybean plants. GmPHD6 is recruited to H3K4me0/1/2 marks and recognizes the G-rich elements in target gene promoters, whereas LHP1 activates expression of these targets. Our study reveals a mechanism involving two partners in a complex. Manipulation of the genes in this pathway should improve stress tolerance in soybean or other legumes/crops.</p>

Mitotic phosphotyrosine network analysis reveals that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)
<p>Tyrosine phosphorylation is closely associated with cell proliferation. During the cell cycle, serine and threonine phosphorylation plays the leading role, and such phosphorylation events are most dynamic during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. However, mitotic phosphotyrosine is not well characterized. Although a few functionally-relevant mitotic phosphotyrosine sites have been characterized, evidence suggests that this modification may be more prevalent than previously appreciated. Here, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation in mitotic human cells including those on spindle-associated proteins.? Database mining confirmed ~2000 mitotic phosphotyrosine sites, and network analysis revealed a number of subnetworks that were enriched in tyrosine-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d proteins, including components of the kinetochore or spindle and SRC family kinases. We identified Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a major signaling hub in the spindle subnetwork, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d at the conserved Tyr<sup>217</sup> in the kinase domain. Substitution of Tyr<sup>217</sup> with a phosphomimetic residue eliminated PLK1 activity in vitro and in cells. Further analysis showed that Tyr<sup>217</sup> phosphorylation reduced the phosphorylation of Thr<sup>210</sup> in the activation loop, a phosphorylation event necessary for PLK1 activity. Our data indicate that mitotic tyrosine phosphorylation regulated a key serine/threonine kinase hub in mitotic cells and suggested that spatially separating tyrosine phosphorylation events can reveal previously unrecognized regulatory events and complexes associated with specific structures of the cell cycle.</p>

Stepwise phosphorylation of leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> receptor 1 defines cellular responses to leukotriene B<sub>4</sub>
<p>Leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> (LTB<sub>4</sub>) receptor type 1 (BLT1) is abundant in phagocytic and immune cells and plays crucial roles in various inflammatory diseases. BLT1 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d at several serine and threonine residues upon stimulation with the inflammatory lipid LTB<sub>4</sub>. Using Phos-tag gel electrophoresis to separate differentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d forms of BLT1, we identified two distinct types of phosphorylation, basal and ligand-induced, in the carboxyl terminus of human BLT1. In the absence of LTB<sub>4</sub>, the basal phosphorylation sites were modified to various degrees, giving rise to many different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d forms of BLT1. Different concentrations of LTB<sub>4</sub> induced distinct phosphorylation events, and these ligand-induced modifications facilitated additional phosphorylation events at the basal phosphorylation sites. Because neutrophils migrate toward inflammatory sites along a gradient of LTB<sub>4</sub>, the degree of BLT1 phosphorylation likely increases in parallel with the increase in LTB<sub>4</sub> concentration as the cells migrate. At high concentrations of LTB<sub>4</sub>, deficiencies in these two types of phosphorylation events impaired chemotaxis and β-hexosaminidase release, a proxy for degranulation, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, respectively. These results suggest that an LTB<sub>4</sub> gradient around inflammatory sites enhances BLT1 phosphorylation in a stepwise manner to facilitate the precise migration of phagocytic and immune cells and the initiation of local responses, including degranulation.</p>

De novo phosphorylation and conformational opening of the tyrosine kinase Lck act in concert to initiate T cell receptor signaling
<p>The enzymatic activity of the Src family tyrosine kinase p56<sup>Lck</sup> (Lck) is tightly controlled by differential phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues, Tyr<sup>394</sup> and Tyr<sup>505</sup>. Phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>394</sup> and the conformational opening of Lck are believed to activate the kinase, whereas Tyr<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation is thought to generate a closed, inactive conformation of Lck. We investigated whether the conformation of Lck and its phosphorylation state act in concert to regulate the initiation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. With a sensitive biosensor, we used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to investigate the conformations of wild-type Lck and its phosphorylation-deficient mutants Y394F and Y505F and the double mutant Y394F/Y505F in unstimulated T cells and after TCR stimulation. With this approach, we separated the conformational changes of Lck from the phosphorylation state of its regulatory tyrosines. We showed that the conformational opening of Lck alone was insufficient to initiate signaling events in T cells. Rather, Lck additionally required phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>394</sup> to induce T cell activation. Consistent with the FLIM measurements, an optimized immunofluorescence microscopy protocol revealed that the TCR-stimulated phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr<sup>394</sup> occurred preferentially at the plasma membrane of Jurkat cells and primary human T cells. Our study supports the hypothesis that T cell activation through the TCR complex is accompanied by the de novo activation of Lck and that phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>394</sup> plays a role in Lck function that goes beyond inducing an open conformation of the kinase.</p>

Multisite phosphorylation by MAPK

Over three-quarters of human proteins may be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d, with many targeted at multiple sites. Such multisite phosphorylation substantially increases the scope for modulating protein function—a protein with <i>n</i> phosphorylation sites has the potential to exist in 2<sup><i>n</i></sup> distinct phosphorylation states, each of which could, in theory, display modified functionality.

The Largest Subunit of DNA Polymerase Delta Is Required for Normal Formation of Meiotic Type I Crossovers
<p>Meiotic recombination contributes to the maintenance of the association between homologous chromosomes (homologs) and ensures the accurate segregation of homologs during anaphase I, thus facilitating the redistribution of alleles among progeny. Meiotic recombination is initiated by the programmed formation of DNA double strand breaks, the repair of which requires DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesis</span></strong>, but the role of DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesis</span></strong> proteins during meiosis is largely unknown. Here, we hypothesized that the lagging strand-specific DNA Polymerase δ (POL δ) might be required for meiotic recombination, based on a previous analysis of DNA Replication Factor1 that suggested a role for lagging strand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesis</span></strong> in meiotic recombination. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), complete mutation of the catalytic subunit of POL δ, encoded by <i>AtPOLD1</i>, leads to embryo lethality. Therefore, we used a meiocyte-specific knockdown strategy to test this hypothesis. Reduced expression of <i>AtPOLD1</i> in meiocytes caused decreased fertility and meiotic defects, including incomplete synapsis, the formation of multivalents, chromosome fragmentation, and improper segregation. Analysis of meiotic crossover (CO) frequencies showed that <i>AtPOLD1<sup>RNAi</sup></i> plants had significantly fewer interference-sensitive COs than the wild type, indicating that AtPOL δ participates in type I CO formation. <i>AtPOLD1<sup>RNAi</sup> atpol2a</i> double mutant meiocytes displayed more severe meiotic phenotypes than those of either single mutant, suggesting that the function of AtPOLD1 and AtPOL2A is not identical in meiotic recombination. Given that POL δ is highly conserved among eukaryotes, we hypothesize that the described role of POL δ here in meiotic recombination likely exists widely in eukaryotes.</p>

Phosphorylation of GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 Alters Stimulation of Mg Chelatase Activity in Angiosperms
<p>GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 (GUN4) is a positive regulator of light-dependent chlorophyll bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesis</span></strong>.

While GUN4 is preferentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d in darkness, phosphorylation is reduced upon accumulation of Mg porphyrins. Expression of a phosphomimicking <i>GUN4</i>(S264D) results in an incomplete complementation of the white <i>gun4-2 null</i> mutant and a chlorotic phenotype comparable to <i>gun4</i> knockdown mutants. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d GUN4 has a reduced stimulatory effect on MgCh in vitro and in vivo but retains its protein stability and tetrapyrrole binding capacity.

Multisite phosphorylation is required for sustained interaction with GRKs and arrestins during rapid μ-opioid receptor desensitization
<p>G protein receptor kinases (GRKs) and β-arrestins are key regulators of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) signaling and trafficking. We have previously shown that high-efficacy opioids such as DAMGO stimulate a GRK2/3-mediated multisite phosphorylation of conserved C-terminal tail serine and threonine residues, which facilitates internalization of the receptor. In contrast, morphine-induced phosphorylation of MOR is limited to Ser<sup>375</sup> and is not sufficient to drive substantial receptor internalization. We report how specific multisite phosphorylation controlled the dynamics of GRK and β-arrestin interactions with MOR and show how such phosphorylation mediated receptor desensitization. We showed that GRK2/3 was recruited more quickly than was β-arrestin to a DAMGO-activated MOR. β-Arrestin recruitment required GRK2 activity and MOR phosphorylation, but GRK recruitment also depended on the phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal tail, specifically four serine and threonine residues within the <sup>370</sup>TREHPSTANT<sup>379</sup> motif. Our results also suggested that other residues outside this motif participated in the initial and transient recruitment of GRK and β-arrestins. We identified two components of high-efficacy agonist desensitization of MOR: a sustained component, which required GRK2-mediated phosphorylation and a potential soluble factor, and a rapid component, which was likely mediated by GRK2 but independent of receptor phosphorylation. Elucidating these complex receptor-effector interactions represents an important step toward a mechanistic understanding of MOR desensitization that leads to the development of tolerance and dependence.</p>

IKK promotes cytokine-induced and cancer-associated AMPK activity and attenuates phenformin-induced cell death in LKB1-deficient cells
<p>The 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensor that is activated upon phosphorylation of Thr<sup>172</sup> in its activation loop by the kinase LKB1, CAMKK2, or TAK1. TAK1-dependent AMPK phosphorylation of Thr<sup>172</sup> is less well characterized than phosphorylation of this site by LKB1 or CAMKK2. An important target of TAK1 is IκB kinase (IKK), which controls the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. We tested the hypothesis that IKK acted downstream of TAK1 to activate AMPK by phosphorylating Thr<sup>172</sup>. IKK was required for the phosphorylation of Thr<sup>172</sup> in AMPK in response to treatment with the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β or TNF-α or upon TAK1 overexpression. In addition, IKK regulated basal AMPK Thr<sup>172</sup> phosphorylation in several cancer cell types independently of TAK1, indicating that other modes of IKK activation could stimulate AMPK. We found that IKK directly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d AMPK at Thr<sup>172</sup> independently of the tumor suppressor LKB1 or energy stress. Accordingly, in LKB1-deficient cells, IKK inhibition reduced AMPK Thr<sup>172</sup> phosphorylation in response to the mitochondrial inhibitor phenformin. This response led to enhanced apoptosis and suggests that IKK inhibition in combination with phenformin could be used clinically to treat patients with LKB1-deficient cancers.</p>

Heterobiaryl synthesis by contractive C–C coupling via P(V) intermediates
<p>Heterobiaryls composed of pyridine and diazine rings are key components of pharmaceuticals and are often central to pharmacological function. We present an alternative approach to metal-catalyzed cross-coupling to make heterobiaryls using contractive phosphorus C–C couplings, also termed phosphorus ligand coupling reactions. The process starts by regioselective phosphorus substitution of the C–H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s para to nitrogen in two successive heterocycles; ligand coupling is then triggered via acidic alcohol solutions to form the heterobiaryl <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>. Mechanistic studies imply that ligand coupling is an asynchronous process involving migration of one heterocycle to the ipso position of the other around a central pentacoordinate P(V) atom. The strategy can be applied to complex drug-like molecules containing multiple reactive sites and polar functional groups, and also enables convergent coupling of drug fragments and late-stage heteroarylation of pharmaceuticals.</p>

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly construct novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA constructs. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible design of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

NDH-PSI Supercomplex Assembly Precedes Full Assembly of the NDH Complex in Chloroplast
<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex is structurally similar to respiratory complex I and mediates PSI cyclic electron flow. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast NDH is composed of at least 29 subunits and associates with two copies of PSI to form the NDH-PSI supercomplex. Here, we found that CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION3 (CRR3) is an assembly factor required for the accumulation of subcomplex B (SubB) of chloroplast NDH. In Suc density gradient centrifugation, CRR3 was detected in three protein complexes. Accumulation of the largest peak III complex was impaired in mutants defective in the SubB subunits PnsB2-PnsB5. The oligomeric form of CRR3 likely functions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong> the core of SubB to form the peak III complex as an assembly intermediate. A defect in the PnsL3 subunit increased the level of the peak III complex, suggesting that CRR3 was released from the assembly intermediate after PnsL3 binding. Unlike PnsB2-PnsB5 and PnsL3, PnsB1 was not absolutely necessary for stabilizing SubB. PnsB1 is likely incorporated into the intermediate at the final step during SubB assembly. Lhca6 is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>er protein mediating NDH-PSI supercomplex formation, and its site of contact with NDH was suggested to be SubB. In the <i>lhca6</i> mutant, accumulation of the peak III complex was impaired, suggesting that SubB interacted with Lhca6 during the step of SubB assembly. The process of supercomplex formation was triggered before the completion of the NDH assembly. Consistent with its predicted function, CRR3 accumulated in young leaves, where the NDH complex was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong>d.</p>

Phosphorylation of Arabidopsis MAP Kinase Phosphatase 1 (MKP1) Is Required for PAMP Responses and Resistance against Bacteria
<p>Plants perceive potential pathogens via the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized pattern recognition receptors, which initiates a series of intracellular responses that ulti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mate</span></strong>ly limit bacterial growth. PAMP responses include changes in intracellular protein phosphorylation, including the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs), such as Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) MKP1, are important negative regulators of MAPKs and play a crucial role in controlling the intensity and duration of MAPK activation during innate immune signaling. As such, the <i>mkp1</i> mutant lacking MKP1 displays enhanced PAMP responses and resistance against the virulent bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000. Previous in vitro studies showed that MKP1 can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d and activated by MPK6, suggesting that phosphorylation may be an important mechanism for regulating MKP1. We found that MKP1 was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d during PAMP elicitation and that phosphorylation stabilized the protein, resulting in protein accumulation after elicitation. MKP1 also can be stabilized by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that MKP1 is constitutively degraded through the proteasome in the resting state. In addition, we investigated the role of MKP1 posttranslational regulation in plant defense by testing whether phenotypes of the <i>mkp1</i> Arabidopsis mutant could be complemented by expressing phosphorylation site mutations of MKP1. The phosphorylation of MKP1 was found to be required for some, but not all, of MKP1’s functions in PAMP responses and defense against bacteria. Together, our results provide insight into the roles of phosphorylation in the regulation of MKP1 during PAMP signaling and resistance to bacteria.</p>

Efficient Inference of Recombination Hot Regions in Bacterial Genomes
<p>In eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of “hotspots” of highly elevated recombination. In bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. Here, we focus in particular on identifying “hot regions” of the genome where DNA is transferred frequently between isolates. We present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed “chromosome painting” algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. We compare the average genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. Using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal regions. We applied our approach to previously analyzed <i>Escherichia coli</i> genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by ClonalOrigin, a method that is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. Furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> by using 200 genomes. We identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related to membrane proteins. Our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable from <ext-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>>https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedPainting</ext-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>>, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.</p>

Phosphorylation of the phosphatase PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that controls osteoclast activity and bone mass in vivo
<p>Bone resorption by osteoclasts is essential for bone homeostasis. The kinase Src promotes osteoclast activity and is activated in osteoclasts by the receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase PTPROt. In other contexts, however, PTPROt can inhibit Src activity. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, we show that PTPROt is bifunctional and can de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong> Src both at its inhibitory residue Tyr<sup>527</sup> and its activating residue Tyr<sup>416</sup>. Whereas wild-type and PTPROt knockout mice exhibited similar bone masses, mice in which a putative C-terminal phosphorylation site, Tyr<sup>399</sup>, in endogenous PTPROt was replaced with phenylalanine had increased bone mass and reduced osteoclast activity. Osteoclasts from the knock-in mice also showed reduced Src activity. Experiments in cultured cells and in osteoclasts derived from both mouse strains demonstrated that the absence of phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>399</sup> caused PTPROt to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong> Src at the activating site pTyr<sup>416</sup>. In contrast, phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> enabled PTPROt to recruit Src through Grb2 and to de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong> Src at the inhibitory site Tyr<sup>527</sup>, thus stimulating Src activity. We conclude that reversible phosphorylation of PTPROt at Tyr<sup>399</sup> is a molecular switch that selects between its opposing activities toward Src and maintains a coherent signaling output, and that b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lock</span></strong>ing this phosphorylation event can induce physiological effects in vivo. Because most receptor-type tyrosine phosphatases contain potential phosphorylation sites at their C termini, we propose that preventing phosphorylation at these sites or its consequences may offer an alternative to inhibiting their catalytic activity to achieve therapeutic benefit.</p>

Mitotic phosphorylation regulates Hsp72 spindle localization by uncoupling ATP binding from substrate release

We determined the crystal structure of the Hsp72 NBD containing a genetically encoded phosphoserine at position 66.

Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>435</sup> and Thr<sup>440</sup> in rat Ric-8A (corresponding to Ser<sup>436</sup> and Thr<sup>441</sup> in human Ric-8A) was required for high-affinity binding to Gα subunits, efficient stimulation of Gα subunit guanine nucleotide exchange, and mediation of Gα subunit folding. The CK2 consensus sites that contain Ser<sup>435</sup> and Thr<sup>440</sup> are conserved in Ric-8 homologs from worms to mammals. We found that the homologous residues in mouse Ric-8B, Ser<sup>468</sup> and Ser<sup>473</sup>, were also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d. Mutation of the genomic copy of <i>ric-8</i> in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to encode alanine in the homologous sites resulted in characteristic <i>ric-8</i> reduction-of-function phenotypes that are associated with defective G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>s</sub> signaling, including reduced locomotion and defective egg laying. The <i>C. elegans ric-8</i> phosphorylation site mutant phenotypes were partially rescued by chemical stimulation of G<sub>q</sub> signaling. These results indicate that dual phosphorylation represents a critical form of conserved Ric-8 regulation and demonstrate that Ric-8 proteins are needed for effective Gα signaling. The position of the CK2-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d sites within a structural model of Ric-8A reveals that these sites contribute to a key acidic and negatively charged surface that may be important for its interactions with Gα subunits.</p>

Aurora B opposes PP1 function in mitosis by phosphorylating the conserved PP1-binding RVxF motif in PP1 regulatory proteins
<p>Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is a highly conserved protein phosphatase that performs most of the serine- and threonine-dephosphorylation reactions in eukaryotes and opposes the actions of a diverse set of serine and threonine (Ser-Thr) protein kinases. PP1 gains substrate specificity through binding to a large number (>200) of regulatory proteins that control PP1 localization, activity, and interactions with substrates. PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF binding motif that is present in many of these regulatory proteins, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes. We showed that a subset of the RVxF binding motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable amino acid (RV[S/T]F), was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory protein. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily governed by the mitotic protein kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites maintained the phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis by disrupting the assembly of PP1 holoenzymes. We generated an antibody that recognizes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory proteins (KNL1, CDCA2, and RIF1) and multiple proteins that could potentially act as PP1 binding partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1, and ELYS) governed by this mechanism. Together, these data suggest a general regulatory mechanism by which the coordinated activities of Aurora B and PP1 control mitotic progression.</p>

Identification of Phosphorylation Sites Altering Pollen Soluble Inorganic Pyrophosphatase Activity<xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Protein phosphorylation regulates numerous cellular processes. Identifying the substrates and protein kinases involved is vital to understand how these important posttranslational modifications modulate biological function in eukaryotic cells. Pyrophosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of inorganic phosphate (PP<sub>i</sub>) to inorganic phosphate P<sub>i</sub>, driving biosynthetic reactions; they are essential for low cytosolic inorganic phosphate. It was suggested recently that posttranslational regulation of Family I soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPases) may affect their activity. We previously demonstrated that two pollen-expressed sPPases, Pr-p26.1a and Pr-p26.1b, from the flowering plant <i>Papaver rhoeas</i> were inhibited by phosphorylation. Despite the potential significance, there is a paucity of data on sPPase phosphorylation and regulation. Here, we used liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry to map phosphorylation sites to the otherwise divergent amino-terminal extensions on these pollen sPPases. Despite the absence of reports in the literature on mapping phosphorylation sites on sPPases, a database survey of various proteomes identified a number of examples, suggesting that phosphorylation may be a more widely used mechanism to regulate these enzymes. Phosphomimetic mutants of Pr-p26.1a/b significantly and differentially reduced PPase activities by up to 2.5-fold at pH 6.8 and 52% in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and hydrogen peroxide over unmodified proteins. This indicates that phosphoregulation of key sites can inhibit the catalytic responsiveness of these proteins in concert with key intracellular events. As sPPases are essential for many metabolic pathways in eukaryotic cells, our findings identify the phosphorylation of sPPases as a potential master regulatory mechanism that could be used to attenuate metabolism.</p>

Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Recombination</span></strong> suppression leads to the structural and functional differentiation of sex chromosomes and is thus a crucial step in the process of sex chromosome evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Recombination</span></strong> suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different sex chromosome system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y chromosome and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which diverged from the ancestor of other lineages approxi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mate</span></strong>ly 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of sex chromosomes based on comparative analyses of these divergent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both chromosome-wide differentiation patterns and phylogenetic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral sex chromosomes were extensively differentiated before the divergence of these lineages. In contrast, genetic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-sex chromosomes. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Recombination</span></strong> maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Recombination</span></strong> has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-sex chromosomes. Chromosomal regions exhibiting genetic differentiation and suppressed or reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Recombination</span></strong> were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-sex chromosomes, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Recombination</span></strong> suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of sex chromosome differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">Recombination</span></strong> suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of sex chromosome evolution.</p>

Resolving Ambiguity of Species Limits and Concatenation in Multilocus Sequence Data for the Construction of Phylogenetic Supermatrices
<p>Public DNA databases are becoming too large and too complex for manual methods to generate phylogenetic supermatrices from multiple gene sequences. Delineating the terminals based on taxonomic labels is no longer practical because species identifications are frequently incomplete and gene trees are incongruent with Linnaean binomials, which results in uncertainty about how to combine species units among un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed loci. We developed a procedure that minimizes the problem of forming multilocus species units in a large phylogenetic data set using algorithms from graph theory. An initial step established sequence clusters for each locus that broadly correspond to the species level. These clusters frequently include sequences labeled with various binomials and specimen identifiers that create multiple alternatives for concatenation. To choose among these possibilities, we minimize taxonomic conflict among the species units globally in the data set using a multipartite heuristic algorithm. The procedure was applied to all available GenBank data for Coleoptera (beetles) including > 10 500 taxon labels and > 23 500 sequences of 4 loci, which were grouped into 11 241 clusters or divergent singletons by the BlastClust software. Within each cluster, unidentified sequences could be assigned to a species name through the association with fully identified sequences, resulting in 510 new identifications (13.9% of total unidentified sequences) of which nearly half were “trans-locus” identifications by clustering of sequences at a secondary locus. The limits of DNA-based clusters were inconsistent with the Linnaean binomials for 1518 clusters (13.5%) that contained more than one binomial or split a single binomial among multiple clusters. By applying a scoring scheme for full and partial name matches in pairs of clusters, a maximum weight set of 7366 global species units was produced. Varying the match weights for partial matches had little effect on the number of units, although if partial matches were disallowed, the number increased greatly. Trees from the resulting supermatrices generally produced tree topologies in good agreement with the higher taxonomy of Coleoptera, with fewer terminals compared with trees generated according to standard filtering of sequences using species labels. The study illustrates a strategy for assembling the tree-of-life from an ever more complex primary database.

Design and evaluation of engineered protein biosensors for live-cell imaging of EGFR phosphorylation
<p>Live-cell fluorescence microscopy is broadly applied to study the dynamics of receptor-mediated cell signaling, but the availability of intracellular biosensors is limited. A biosensor based on the tandem SH2 domains from phospholipase C–γ1 (PLCγ1), tSH2-WT, has been used to measure phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here, we found that tSH2-WT lacked specificity for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d EGFR, consistent with the known promiscuity of SH2 domains. Further, EGF-stimulated membrane recruitment of tSH2-WT differed qualitatively from the expected kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation. Analysis of a mathematical model suggested, and experiments confirmed, that the high avidity of tSH2-WT resulted in saturation of its target and interference with EGFR endocytosis. To overcome the apparent target specificity and saturation issues, we implemented two protein engineering strategies. In the first approach, we screened a combinatorial library generated by random mutagenesis of the C-terminal SH2 domain (cSH2) of PLCγ1 and isolated a mutant form (mSH2) with enhanced specificity for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d Tyr<sup>992</sup> (pTyr<sup>992</sup>) of EGFR. A biosensor based on mSH2 closely reported the kinetics of EGFR phosphorylation but retained cross-reactivity similar to tSH2-WT. In the second approach, we isolated a pTyr<sup>992</sup>-binding protein (SPY992) from a combinatorial library generated by mutagenesis of the Sso7d protein scaffold. Compared to tSH2-WT and mSH2, SPY992 exhibited superior performance as a specific, moderate-affinity biosensor. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extend</span></strong>ed this approach to isolate a biosensor for EGFR pTyr<sup>1148</sup> (SPY1148). This approach of integrating theoretical considerations with protein engineering strategies can be generalized to design and evaluate suitable biosensors for various phospho-specific targets.</p>

Modulation of Cl<sup>−</sup> signaling and ion transport by recruitment of kinases and phosphatases mediated by the regulatory protein IRBIT
<p>IRBIT is a multifunctional protein that controls the activity of various epithelial ion transporters including NBCe1-B. Interaction with IRBIT increases NBCe1-B activity and exposes two cryptic Cl<sup>−</sup>-sensing GXXXP sites that enable regulation of NBCe1-B by intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> (Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>). Here, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that IRBIT controlled five phosphorylation sites in NBCe1-B that determined both the active conformation of the transporter and its regulation by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Mutational analysis suggested that the phosphorylation status of Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> was regulated by IRBIT and determined whether NBCe1 transporters are in active or inactive conformations. The absence of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, or Ser<sup>235</sup> produced NBCe1-B in the conformations pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup>, or pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup>, respectively. The activity of the pSer<sup>233</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form was similar to that of IRBIT-activated NBCe1-B, but it was insensitive to inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. The properties of the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>235</sup> form were similar to those of wild-type NBCe1-B, whereas the pSer<sup>232</sup>/pSer<sup>233</sup> form was partially active, further activated by IRBIT, but retained inhibition by Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub>. Furthermore, IRBIT recruited the phosphatase PP1 and the kinase SPAK to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>65</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>32</sup>GXXXP<sup>36</sup> motif. IRBIT also recruited the phosphatase calcineurin and the kinase CaMKII to control phosphorylation of Ser<sup>12</sup>, which affected Cl<sup>−</sup><sub>in</sub> sensing by the <sup>194</sup>GXXXP<sup>198</sup> motif. Ser<sup>232</sup>, Ser<sup>233</sup>, and Ser<sup>235</sup> are conserved in all NBCe1 variants and affect their activity. These findings reveal how multiple kinase and phosphatase pathways use phosphorylation sites to fine-tune a transporter, which have important implications for epithelial fluid and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> secretion.</p>

G protein–coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) orchestrate biased agonism at the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor
<p>Biased agonists of G protein–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">couple</span></strong>d receptors (GPCRs), which selectively activate either G protein– or β-arrestin–mediated signaling pathways, are of major therapeutic interest because they have the potential to show improved efficacy and specificity as drugs. Efforts to understand the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon have focused on the hypothesis that G proteins and β-arrestins preferentially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">couple</span></strong> to distinct GPCR conformations. However, because GPCR kinase (GRK)–dependent receptor phosphorylation is a critical prerequisite for the recruitment of β-arrestins to most GPCRs, GRKs themselves may play an important role in establishing biased signaling. We showed that an alanine mutant of the highly conserved residue tyrosine 219 (Y219A) in transmembrane domain five of the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) was incapable of β-arrestin recruitment, receptor internalization, and β-arrestin–mediated activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), whereas it retained the ability to signal through G protein. We found that the impaired β-arrestin recruitment in cells was due to reduced GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the β<sub>2</sub>AR Y219A C terminus, which was recapitulated in vitro with purified components. Furthermore, in vitro ligation of a synthetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d peptide onto the C terminus of β<sub>2</sub>AR Y219A rescued both the initial recruitment of β-arrestin and its engagement with the intracellular core of the receptor. These data suggest that the Y219A mutation generates a G protein–biased state primarily by conformational selection against GRK coupling, rather than against β-arrestin. Together, these findings highlight the importance of GRKs in modulating the biased agonism of GPCRs.</p>

Phosphorylation of amyloid precursor protein by mutant LRRK2 promotes AICD activity and neurotoxicity in Parkinson’s disease
<p>Mutations in <i>LRRK2</i>, which encodes leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, are the most common genetic cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD), a degenerative disease of the central nervous system that causes impaired motor function and, in advanced stages, dementia. Dementia is a common symptom of another neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and research suggests that there may be pathophysiological and genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>s between the two diseases. Aggregates of β amyloid [a protein produced through cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP)] are seen in both diseases and in PD patients carrying G2019S-mutant LRRK2. Using patient-derived cells, brain tissue, and PD model mice, we found that LRRK2 interacted with and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> within its intracellular domain (AICD). Phosphorylation of APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> promoted AICD transcriptional activity and correlated with increased nuclear abundance of AICD and decreased abundance of a dopaminergic neuron marker in cultures and brain tissue. The AICD regulates the transcription of genes involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and apoptosis. Overexpression of AICD, but not a phosphodeficient mutant (AICD<sup>T668A</sup>), increased the loss of dopaminergic neurons in older mice expressing LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup>. Moreover, the amount of Thr<sup>668</sup>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d APP was substantially greater in postmortem brain tissue and dopaminergic neurons (generated by reprogramming skin cells) from LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> patients than in those from healthy individuals. LRRK2 inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation of APP at Thr<sup>668</sup> in the patient-derived dopaminergic neurons and in the midbrains of LRRK2<sup>G2019S</sup> mice. Thus, APP is a substrate of LRRK2, and its phosphorylation promotes AICD function and neurotoxicity in PD.</p>

Structural basis for eIF2B inhibition in integrated stress response

We report here unambiguous experimental validation of this hypothesis: Detailed kinetic measurements demonstrate that stretching phosphotriesters accelerates dissociation of the unloaded phosphorus-oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> orthogonal to the pulling axis, whereas stretching organosiloxanes inhibits dissociation of the aligned loaded silicon-oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>s. Qualitatively, the outcome is determined by phosphoester elongation and siloxane contraction along the pulling axis in the respective rate-determining transition states. Quantitatively, the results agree with a simple mechanochemical kinetics model.</p>

De novo assembly of the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> genome using Hi-C yields chromosome-length scaffolds
<p>The Zika outbreak, spread by the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito, highlights the need to create high-quality assemblies of large genomes in a rapid and cost-effective way. Here we combine Hi-C data with existing draft assemblies to generate chromosome-length scaffolds. We validate this method by assembling a human genome, de novo, from short reads alone (67× coverage). We then combine our method with draft sequences to create genome assemblies of the mosquito disease vectors <i>Ae</i>.<i> aegypti</i> and <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i>, each consisting of three scaffolds corresponding to the three chromosomes in each species. These assemblies indicate that almost all genomic rearrangements among these species occur within, rather than between, chromosome arms. The genome assembly procedure we describe is fast, inexpensive, and accurate, and can be applied to many species.</p>

Clathrate colloidal crystals
<p>DNA-programmable assembly has been used to deliberately synthesize hundreds of different colloidal crystals spanning dozens of symmetries, but the complexity of the achieved structures has so far been limited to small unit cells. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong>d DNA-modified triangular bipyramids (~250-nanometer long edge, 177-nanometer short edge) into clathrate architectures. Electron microscopy images revealed that at least three different structures form as large single-domain architectures or as multidomain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mate</span></strong>rials. Ordered assemblies, isostructural to clathrates, were identified with the help of molecular simulations and geometric analysis.

Opposing effects of Elk-1 multisite phosphorylation shape its response to ERK activation
<p>Multisite phosphorylation regulates many transcription factors, including the serum response factor partner Elk-1. Phosphorylation of the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of Elk-1 by the protein kinase ERK at multiple sites potentiates recruitment of the Mediator transcriptional coactivator complex and transcriptional activation, but the roles of individual phosphorylation events had remained unclear. Using time-resolved nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we found that ERK2 phosphorylation proceeds at markedly different rates at eight TAD sites in vitro, which we classified as fast, intermediate, and slow. Mutagenesis experiments showed that phosphorylation of fast and intermediate sites promoted Mediator interaction and transcriptional activation, whereas modification of slow sites counteracted both functions, thereby limiting Elk-1 output. Progressive Elk-1 phosphorylation thus ensures a self-limiting response to ERK activation, which occurs independently of antagonizing phosphatase activity.</p>

Red Light-Induced Phosphorylation of Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in Stomatal Guard Cells
<p>Stomatal opening is stimulated by red and blue light. Blue light activates plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by phosphorylating its penulti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mate</span></strong> residue, threonine, via a blue light photoreceptor phototropin-mediated signaling pathway in guard cells. Blue light-activated PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase promotes the accumulation of osmolytes and, thus, the osmotic influx of water into guard cells, driving stomatal opening. Red light-induced stomatal opening is thought to be dependent on photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesis</span></strong> in both guard cell chloroplasts and mesophyll cells; however, how red light induces stomatal opening and whether PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is involved in this process have remained unclear. In this study, we established an immunohistochemical technique to detect the phosphorylation level of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and unexpectedly found that red light induces PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in whole leaves. Red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in whole leaves was correlated with stomatal opening under red light and was inhibited by the plant hormone abscisic acid. In <i>aha1</i>-<i>9</i>, a knockout mutant of one of the major isoforms of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells, red light-dependent stomatal opening was delayed in whole leaves. Furthermore, the photosynthetic electron transport inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea inhibited red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation as well as red light-induced stomatal opening in whole leaves. Our results indicate that red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in guard cells promotes stomatal opening in whole leaves, providing insight into the photosynthetic regulation of stomatal opening.</p>

Starch Deficiency Enhances Lipid Biosynthesis and Turnover in Leaves
<p>Starch and lipids represent two major forms of carbon and energy storage in plants and play central roles in diverse cellular processes. However, whether and how starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact to regulate metabolism and growth are poorly understood. Here, we show that lipids can partially compensate for the lack of function of transient starch during normal growth and development in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Disruption of starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesis</span></strong> resulted in a significant increase in fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesis</span></strong> via posttranslational regulation of the plastidic acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and a concurrent increase in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesis</span></strong> and turnover of membrane lipids and triacylglycerol. Genetic analysis showed that b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lock</span></strong>ing fatty acid peroxisomal β-oxidation, the sole pathway for metabolic breakdown of fatty acids in plants, significantly compromised or stunted the growth and development of mutants defective in starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesis</span></strong> under long days or short days, respectively. We also found that the combined disruption of starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesis</span></strong> and fatty acid turnover resulted in increased accumulation of membrane lipids, triacylglycerol, and soluble sugars and altered fatty acid flux between the two lipid biosynthetic pathways compartmentalized in either the chloroplast or the endoplasmic reticulum. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of fatty acid β-oxidation and the regulatory network controlling fatty acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesis</span></strong>, and they reveal the mechanistic basis by which starch and lipid metabolic pathways interact and undergo cross talk to modulate carbon allocation, energy homeostasis, and plant growth.</p>

Reconstitution of Abscisic Acid Signaling from the Receptor to DNA via bHLH Transcription Factors
<p>The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) confers drought tolerance in plants through stomatal closure and regulation of gene expression. The complex consisting of the ABA receptor PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE/REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTOR (PYR/RCAR), type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C), and SNF1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) has a key role in ABA signaling. Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional activator ABA-RESPONSIVE KINASE SUBSTRATE1 (AKS1, also known as FBH3) is released from DNA by phosphorylation-induced monomerization in response to ABA in guard cells. Here we reconstituted the release of AKS1 from DNA via the ABA signaling core complex in vitro. We first obtained evidence to confirm that AKS1 is an endogenous substrate for SnRK2s. Phosphorylation of AKS1 and activation of SnRK2 showed the same time course in response to ABA in guard cells. AKS1 was bound to SnRK2.6 in vivo. Three ABA-responsive SnRK2s (SnRK2.2/SRK2D, SnRK2.3/SRK2I, and SnRK2.6/SRK2E/OST1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">phosphorylate</span></strong>d AKS1 in vitro, and the phosphorylation was eliminated by the triple mutation of SnRK2s in plants. We reconstituted the AKS1 phosphorylation in vitro via the signaling complex containing the ABA receptor PYR1, a PP2C, HYPERSENSITIVE TO ABA1 (HAB1), and a protein kinase, SnRK2.6 in response to ABA. We further reconstituted the release of AKS1 from the target gene of <i>POTASSIUM CHANNEL IN ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 1</i> (<i>KAT1</i>) via the complex in response to ABA. These results demonstrate that AKS1 provides a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong> between the signaling complex and ABA-responsive genes and furnish evidence for a minimal signaling mechanism from ABA perception to DNA.</p>

VAMP721 Conformations Unmask an Extended Motif for K<sup>+</sup> Channel Binding and Gating Control
<p>Soluble <i>N</i>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">attach</span></strong>ment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins play a major role in membrane fusion and contribute to cell expansion, signaling, and polar growth in plants. The SNARE SYP121 of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> that facilitates vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane also binds with, and regulates, K<sup>+</sup> channels already present at the plasma membrane to affect K<sup>+</sup> uptake and K<sup>+</sup>-dependent growth. Here, we report that its cognate partner VAMP721, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong>s with SYP121 to drive membrane fusion, binds to the KAT1 K<sup>+</sup> channel via two sites on the protein, only one of which contributes to channel-gating control. Binding to the VAMP721 SNARE domain suppressed channel gating. By contrast, interaction with the amino-terminal longin domain conferred specificity on VAMP721 binding without influencing gating. Channel binding was defined by a linear motif within the longin domain. The SNARE domain is thought to wrap around this structure when not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">assemble</span></strong>d with SYP121 in the SNARE complex. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed that mutations within this motif, which suppressed channel binding and its effects on gating, also altered the conformational displacement between the VAMP721 SNARE and longin domains. The presence of these two channel-binding sites on VAMP721, one also required for SNARE complex assembly, implies a well-defined sequence of events coordinating K<sup>+</sup> uptake and the final stages of vesicle traffic. It suggests that binding begins with VAMP721, and subsequently with SYP121, thereby coordinating K<sup>+</sup> channel gating during SNARE assembly and vesicle fusion. Thus, our findings also are consistent with the idea that the K<sup>+</sup> channels are nucleation points for SNARE complex assembly.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Old but Not (So) Degenerated—Slow Evolution of Largely Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in Ratites
<p>Degeneration of the nonrecombining chromosome is a common feature of sex chromosome evolution, readily evident by the presence of a pair of largely heteromorphic chromosomes, like in eutherian mammals and birds. However, in ratites (order Palaeognathae, including, e.g., ostrich), the Z and W chromosomes are similar in size and largely undifferentiated, despite avian sex chromosome evolution was initiated > 130 Ma. To better understand what may limit sex chromosome evolution, we performed ostrich transcriptome sequencing and studied genes from the nonrecombining region of the W chromosome. Fourteen gametologous gene pairs present on the W chromosome and Z chromosome were identified, with synonymous sequence divergence of 0.027–0.177. The location of these genes on the Z chromosome was consistent with a sequential increase in divergence, starting 110–157 and ending 24–30 Ma. On the basis of the occurrence of Z-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed genes hemizygous in females, we esti<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mate</span></strong> that about one-third of the Z chromosome does not recombine with the W chromosome in female meiosis. Pairwise <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> between gametologs decreased with age, suggesting strong evolutionary constraint in old gametologs. Lineage-specific <i>d</i><sub>N</sub><i>/d</i><sub>S</sub> was consistently higher in W-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed genes, in accordance with the lower efficacy of selection expected in nonrecombining chromosomes. A higher ratio of GC > AT:AT > GC substitutions in W-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed genes supports a role for GC-biased gene conversion in differentially driving base composition on the two sex chromosomes. A male-to-female (M:F) expression ratio of close to one for recombining genes and close to two for Z-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">link</span></strong>ed genes lacking a W copy show that dosage compensation is essentially absent. Some gametologous genes have retained active expression of the W copy in females (giving a M:F ratio of 1 for the gametologous gene pair), whereas for others W expression has become severely reduced resulting in a M:F ratio of close to 2. These observations resemble the patterns of sex chromosome evolution seen in other avian and mammalian lineages, suggesting similar underlying evolutionary processes, although the rate of sex chromosome differentiation has been atypically low. Lack of dosage compensation may be a factor hindering sex chromosome evolution in this lineage.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle motion, with particle motion dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle motion component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lock</span></strong>ing of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lock</span></strong> was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lock</span></strong>ing to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Structure of the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B reveals mechanism of memory-enhancing molecule
<p>Regulation by the integrated stress response (ISR) converges on the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2 in response to a variety of stresses. Phosphorylation converts eIF2 from a substrate to a competitive inhibitor of its dedicated guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, thereby inhibiting translation. ISRIB, a drug-like eIF2B activator, reverses the effects of eIF2 phosphorylation, and in rodents it enhances cognition and corrects cognitive deficits after brain injury. To determine its mechanism of action, we solved an atomic-resolution structure of ISRIB bound in a deep cleft within decameric human eIF2B by cryo–electron microscopy. Formation of fully active, decameric eIF2B holoenzyme depended on the assembly of two identical tetrameric subcomplexes, and ISRIB promoted this step by cross-bridging a central symmetry interface. Thus, regulation of eIF2B assembly emerges as a rheostat for eIF2B activity that tunes translation during the ISR and that can be further modulated by ISRIB.</p>

Organometallic and radical intermediates reveal mechanism of diphthamide biosynthesis
<p>Diphthamide bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synthesis</span></strong> involves a carbon-carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong>-forming reaction catalyzed by a radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme that cleaves a carbon-sulfur (C–S) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> in SAM to generate a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl (ACP) radical. Using rapid freezing, we have captured an organometallic intermediate with an iron-carbon (Fe–C) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> between ACP and the enzyme’s [4Fe-4S] cluster. In the presence of the substrate protein, elongation factor 2, this intermediate converts to an organic radical, formed by addition of the ACP radical to a histidine side chain. Crystal structures of archaeal diphthamide biosynthetic radical SAM enzymes reveal that the carbon of the SAM C–S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bond</span></strong> being cleaved is positioned near the unique cluster Fe, able to react with the cluster.

Mechanically robust, readily repairable polymers via tailored noncovalent cross-linking
<p>Expanding the range of healable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mate</span></strong>rials is an important challenge for sustainable societies. Noncrystalline, high-molecular-weight polymers generally form mechanically robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mate</span></strong>rials, which, however, are difficult to repair once they are fractured. This is because their polymer chains are heavily entangled and diffuse too sluggishly to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unite</span></strong> fractured surfaces within reasonable time scales.

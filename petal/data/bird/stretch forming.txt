Experimentally realized mechanochemistry distinct from force-accelerated scission of loaded bonds
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>ing polymer chains accelerates dissociation of a variety of internal covalent bonds, to an extent that correlates well with the force experienced by the scissile bond. Recent theory has also predicted scenarios in which applied force accelerates dissociation of unloaded bonds and kinetically strengthens strained bonds. We report here unambiguous experimental validation of this hypothesis: Detailed kinetic measurements demonstrate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>ing phosphotriesters accelerates dissociation of the unloaded phosphorus-oxygen bond orthogonal to the pulling axis, whereas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>ing organosiloxanes inhibits dissociation of the aligned loaded silicon-oxygen bonds. Qualitatively, the outcome is determined by phosphoester elongation and siloxane contraction along the pulling axis in the respective rate-determining transition states. Quantitatively, the results agree with a simple mechanochemical kinetics model.</p>

Satellite cell activation and populations on single muscle-fiber cultures from adult zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>)
<p>Satellite cells (SCs), stem cells in skeletal muscle, are mitotically quiescent in adult mammals until activated for growth or regeneration. In mouse muscle, SCs are activated by nitric oxide (NO), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the mechanically induced NO–HGF signaling cascade. Here, the SC population on fibers from the adult, ectothermic zebrafish and SC responsiveness to activating stimuli were assessed using the model system of isolated fibers cultured at 27 and 21°C. SCs were identified by immunostaining for the HGF receptor, c-met, and activation was determined using bromodeoxyuridine uptake in culture or <i>in vivo</i>. In dose–response studies, SC activation was increased by treatment with the NO-donor drug isosorbide dinitrate (1 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) or HGF (10 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) to maximum activation at lower concentrations of both than in previous studies of mouse fibers. HGF-induced activation was blocked by anti-c-met antibody, and reduced by culture at 21°C. The effect of cyclical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong> (3 h at 4 cycles per minute) increased activation and was blocked by nitric oxide synthase inhibition and reduced by culture at 21°C. The number of c-met+ SCs per fiber increased rapidly (by 3 h) after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>ing. The character of signaling in SC activation on zebrafish fibers, in particular temperature-dependent responses to HGF and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>, gives new insights into the influence of ectothermy on regulation of muscle growth in teleosts and suggests the use of the single-fiber model system to explore the basis of fiber hyperplasia and the conservation of regulatory pathways between species.</p>

ChloroMitoSSRDB: Open Source Repository of Perfect and Imperfect Repeats in Organelle Genomes for Evolutionary Genomics
<p>Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are repetitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>es of nucleotides (A, T, G, C) that are distributed either as single base pair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>es or as a combination of two- to six-nucleotides units that are non-randomly distributed within coding and in non-coding regions of the genome. ChloroMitoSSRDB is a complete curated web-oriented relational database of perfect and imperfect repeats in organelle genomes. The present version of the database contains perfect and imperfect SSRs of 2161 organelle genomes (1982 mitochondrial and 179 chloroplast genomes). We detected a total of 5838 chloroplast perfect SSRs, 37 297 chloroplast imperfect SSRs, 5898 mitochondrial perfect SSRs and 50 355 mitochondrial imperfect SSRs across these genomes. The repeats have been further hyperlinked to the annotated gene regions (coding or non-coding) and a link to the corresponding gene record in National Center for Biotechnology Information(<ext-link>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) to identify and understand the positional relationship of the repetitive tracts. ChloroMitoSSRDB is connected to a user-friendly web interface that provides useful information associated with the location of the repeats (coding and non-coding), size of repeat, motif and length polymorphism, etc. ChloroMitoSSRDB will serve as a repository for developing functional markers for molecular phylogenetics, estimating molecular variation across species. Database URL: ChloroMitoSSRDB can be accessed as an open source repository at <ext-link>www.mcr.org.in/chloromitossrdb</ext-link>.</p>

A PLCγ1-Dependent, Force-Sensitive Signaling Network in the Myogenic Constriction of Cerebral Arteries
<sec><title>Maintaining Blood Flow to the Brain</title><p>Cerebral arteries continually adjust to changes in blood pressure to ensure constant blood flow to the brain. In response to increased blood pressure, the smooth muscle cells in cerebral arteries contract, resulting in blood vessel constriction. This response requires two cell surface ion channels—TRPC6, a channel that is activated by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong> caused by increased blood pressure, and TRPM4, a channel that triggers the electrical impulses necessary for blood vessel constriction. Gonzales <i>et al.</i> found that activation of TRPC6 stimulated TRPM4 through calcium-dependent pathways. TRPC6, TRPM4, and the enzyme PLCγ1 were located in close proximity to each other in smooth muscle cells, indicating that a pressure-sensitive signaling network keeps blood flowing in the brain.</p></sec>

Identification of site-specific isotopic labels by vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope
<p>The identification of isotopic labels by conventional macroscopic techniques lacks spatial resolution and requires relatively large quantities of material for measurements. We recorded the vibrational spectra of an α amino acid, <sc>l</sc>-alanine, with damage-free “aloof” electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope to directly resolve carbon-site–specific isotopic labels in real space with nanoscale spatial resolution. An isotopic red shift of 4.8 ± 0.4 milli–electron volts in C–O asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>ing modes was observed for <sup>13</sup>C-labeled <sc>l</sc>-alanine at the carboxylate carbon site, which was confirmed by macroscopic infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. The accurate measurement of this shift opens the door to nondestructive, site-specific, spatially resolved identification of isotopically labeled molecules with the electron microscope.</p>

PIEZOs mediate neuronal sensing of blood pressure and the baroreceptor reflex
<p>Activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>-sensitive baroreceptor neurons exerts acute control over heart rate and blood pressure. Although this homeostatic baroreflex has been described for more than 80 years, the molecular identity of baroreceptor mechanosensitivity remains unknown. We discovered that mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are together required for baroreception. Genetic ablation of both <i>Piezo1</i> and <i>Piezo2</i> in the nodose and petrosal sensory ganglia of mice abolished drug-induced baroreflex and aortic depressor nerve activity. Awake, behaving animals that lack <i>Piezos</i> had labile hypertension and increased blood pressure variability, consistent with phenotypes in baroreceptor-denervated animals and humans with baroreflex failure. Optogenetic activation of <i>Piezo2</i>-positive sensory afferents was sufficient to initiate baroreflex in mice. These findings suggest that PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are the long-sought baroreceptor mechanosensors critical for acute blood pressure control.</p>

Structure and dynamics of the yeast SWR1-nucleosome complex
<p>The yeast SWR1 complex exchanges histone H2A in nucleosomes with Htz1 (H2A.Z in humans). The cryo–electron microscopy structure of the SWR1 complex bound to a nucleosome at 3.6-angstrom resolution reveals details of the intricate interactions between components of the SWR1 complex and its nucleosome substrate. Interactions between the Swr1 motor domains and the DNA wrap at superhelical location 2 distort the DNA, causing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bulg</span></strong>e with concomitant translocation of the DNA by one base pair, coupled to conformational changes of the histone core. Furthermore, partial unwrapping of the DNA from the histone core takes place upon binding of nucleosomes to SWR1 complex. The unwrapping, as monitored by single-molecule data, is stabilized and has its dynamics altered by adenosine triphosphate binding but does not require hydrolysis.</p>

Observation of alkaline earth complexes M(CO)<sub>8</sub> (M = Ca, Sr, or Ba) that mimic transition metals
<p>The alkaline earth metals calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba) typically engage in chemical bonding as classical main-group elements through their <i>n</i>s and <i>n</i>p valence orbitals, where <i>n</i> is the principal quantum number. Here we report the isolation and spectroscopic characterization of eight-coordinate carbonyl complexes M(CO)<sub>8</sub> (where M = Ca, Sr, or Ba) in a low-temperature neon matrix. Analysis of the electronic structure of these cubic <i>O<sub>h</sub></i>-symmetric complexes reveals that the metal–carbon monoxide (CO) bonds arise mainly from [M(d<sub>π</sub>)] → (CO)<sub>8</sub> π backdonation, which explains the strong observed red shift of the C-O <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>ing frequencies.

Large-scale ocean deoxygenation during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum
<p>The consequences of global warming for fisheries are not well understood, but the geological record demonstrates that carbon cycle perturbations are frequently associated with ocean deoxygenation. Of particular interest is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), where the carbon dioxide input into the atmosphere was similar to the IPCC RCP8.5 emission scenario. Here we present sulfur-isotope data that record a positive 1 per mil excursion during the PETM. Modeling suggests that large parts of the ocean must have become sulfidic. The toxicity of hydrogen sulfide will render two of the largest and least explored ecosystems on Earth, the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones, uninhabitable by multicellular organisms. This will affect many marine species whose ecozones <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong> into the deep ocean.</p>

Structure basis for RNA-guided DNA degradation by Cascade and Cas3
<p>Type I CRISPR-Cas system features a sequential target-searching and degradation process on double-stranded DNA by the RNA-guided Cascade (CRISPR associated complex for antiviral defense) complex and the nuclease-helicase fusion enzyme Cas3, respectively. Here, we present a 3.7-angstrom-resolution cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Type I-E Cascade/R-loop/Cas3 complex, poised to initiate DNA degradation. Cas3 distinguishes Cascade conformations and only captures the R-loop–forming Cascade, to avoid cleaving partially complementary targets. Its nuclease domain recruits the nontarget strand (NTS) DNA at a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bulg</span></strong>ed region for the nicking of single-stranded DNA. An additional 4.7-angstrom-resolution cryo-EM structure captures the postnicking state, in which the severed NTS retracts to the helicase entrance, to be threaded for adenosine 5′-triphosphate–dependent processive degradation. These snapshots form the basis for understanding RNA-guided DNA degradation in Type I-E CRISPR-Cas systems.</p>

Body size downgrading of mammals over the late Quaternary
<p>Since the late Pleistocene, large-bodied mammals have been extirpated from much of Earth. Although all habitable continents once harbored giant mammals, the few remaining species are largely confined to Africa. This decline is coincident with the global expansion of hominins over the late Quaternary. Here, we quantify mammalian extinction selectivity, continental body size distributions, and taxonomic diversity over five time periods spanning the past 125,000 years and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>ing approximately 200 years into the future. We demonstrate that size-selective extinction was already under way in the oldest interval and occurred on all continents, within all trophic modes, and across all time intervals. Moreover, the degree of selectivity was unprecedented in 65 million years of mammalian evolution. The distinctive selectivity signature implicates hominin activity as a primary driver of taxonomic losses and ecosystem homogenization. Because megafauna have a disproportionate influence on ecosystem structure and function, past and present body size downgrading is reshaping Earth’s biosphere.</p>

Adaptive infrared-reflecting systems inspired by cephalopods

The development of their adaptive variants, in which the infrared-reflecting properties dynamically change in response to external stimuli, has emerged as an important unmet scientific challenge. By <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">draw</span></strong>ing inspiration from cephalopod skin, we developed adaptive infrared-reflecting platforms that feature a simple actuation mechanism, low working temperature, tunable spectral range, weak angular dependence, fast response, stability to repeated cycling, amenability to patterning and multiplexing, autonomous operation, robust mechanical properties, and straightforward manufacturability. Our findings may open opportunities for infrared camouflage and other technologies that regulate infrared radiation.</p>

In addition, the model fundamentally breaks the defense of modern text-based CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) by generatively segmenting characters without CAPTCHA-specific heuristics. Our model emphasizes aspects such as data efficiency and compositionality that may be important in the path toward general artificial intelligence.</p>

Harvesting electrical energy from carbon nanotube yarn twist

We report carbon nanotube yarn harvesters that electrochemically convert tensile or torsional mechanical energy into electrical energy without requiring an external bias voltage. Stretching coiled yarns generated 250 watts per kilogram of peak electrical power when cycled up to 30 hertz, as well as up to 41.2 joules per kilogram of electrical energy per mechanical cycle, when normalized to harvester yarn weight. These energy harvesters were used in the ocean to harvest wave energy, combined with thermally driven artificial muscles to convert temperature fluctuations to electrical energy, sewn into textiles for use as self-powered respiration sensors, and used to power a light-emitting diode and to charge a storage capacitor.</p>

Complete measurement of helicity and its dynamics in vortex tubes
<p>Helicity, a topological measure of the intertwining of vortices in a fluid flow, is a conserved quantity in inviscid fluids but can be dissipated by viscosity in real flows. Despite its relevance across a range of flows, helicity in real fluids remains poorly understood because the entire quantity is challenging to measure. We measured the total helicity of thin-core vortex tubes in water. For helical vortices that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>ed or compressed by a second vortex, we found conservation of total helicity. For an isolated helical vortex, we observed evolution toward and maintenance of a constant helicity state after the dissipation of twist helicity by viscosity. Our results show that helicity can remain constant even in a viscous fluid and provide an improved basis for understanding and manipulating helicity in real flows.</p>

Plants transfer lipids to sustain colonization by mutualistic mycorrhizal and parasitic fungi

Organic nutrients are thought to be supplied primarily in the form of sugars. Here we show that the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> is a fatty acid auxotroph and that fatty acids synthesized in the host plants are transferred to the fungus to sustain mycorrhizal colonization. The transfer is dependent on RAM2 (REQUIRED FOR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZATION 2) and the ATP binding cassette transporter–mediated plant lipid export pathway. We further show that plant fatty acids can be transferred to the pathogenic fungus <i>Golovinomyces cichoracerum</i> and are required for colonization by pathogens. We suggest that the mutualistic mycorrhizal and pathogenic fungi similarly recruit the fatty acid biosynthesis program to facilitate host invasion.</p>

Real-time spectral interferometry probes the internal dynamics of femtosecond soliton molecules

We track two- and three-soliton bound states over hundreds of thousands of consecutive cavity roundtrips, identifying fixed points and periodic and aperiodic molecular orbits. A class of trajectories acquires a path-dependent geometrical phase, implying that its dynamics may be topologically protected. These findings highlight the importance of real-time detection in resolving interactions in complex nonlinear systems, including the dynamics of soliton bound states, breathers, and rogue waves.</p>

When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime radiative cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting radiative cooling as a viable energy technology.</p>

Transcriptional Roadmap to Seasonal Variation in Wood Formation of Norway Spruce
<p>Seasonal cues influence several aspects of the secondary growth of tree stems, including cambial activity, wood chemistry, and transition to latewood formation. We investigated seasonal changes in cambial activity, secondary cell wall formation, and tracheid cell death in woody tissues of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) throughout one seasonal cycle. RNA sequencing was performed simultaneously in both the xylem and cambium/phloem tissues of the stem. Principal component analysis revealed gradual shifts in the transcriptomes that followed a chronological order throughout the season. A notable remodeling of the transcriptome was observed in the winter, with many genes having maximal expression during the coldest months of the year. A highly coexpressed set of monolignol biosynthesis genes showed high expression during the period of secondary cell wall formation as well as a second peak in midwinter. This midwinter peak in expression did not trigger lignin deposition, as determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Coexpression consensus network analyses suggested the involvement of transcription factors belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES and MYELOBLASTOSIS-HOMEOBOX families in the seasonal control of secondary cell wall formation of tracheids. Interestingly, the lifetime of the latewood tracheids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>ed beyond the winter dormancy period, correlating with a lack of cell death-related gene expression. Our transcriptomic analyses combined with phylogenetic and microscopic analyses also identified the cellulose and lignin biosynthetic genes and putative regulators for latewood formation and tracheid cell death in Norway spruce, providing a toolbox for further physiological and functional assays of these important phase transitions.</p>

A Pectin Methylesterase Inhibitor Enhances Resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> Wilt
<p>Pectins are major components of the primary plant cell wall, which functions as the primary barrier against pathogens. Pectin methylesterases (PMEs) catalyze the demethylesterification of the homogalacturonan domains of pectin in the plant cell wall. Their activity is regulated by PME inhibitors (PMEIs). Here, we provide evidence that the pectin methylesterase-inhibiting protein GhPMEI3 from cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum</i>) functions in plant responses to infection by the fungus <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>. GhPMEI3 interacts with PMEs and regulates the expression of a specific fungal polygalacturonase (VdPG1). Ectopic expression of GhPMEI3 increased pectin methyl esterification and limited fungal disease in cotton, while also modulating root elongation. Enzymatic analyses revealed that GhPMEI3 efficiently inhibited the activity of cotton GhPME2/GhPME31. Experiments using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants expressing the <i>GhPMEI3</i> gene under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter revealed that GhPMEI3 inhibits the endogenous PME activity in vitro. Moreover, the enhanced resistance to <i>V. dahliae</i> was associated with altered <i>VdPG1</i> expression. Virus-induced silencing of <i>GhPMEI3</i> resulted in increased susceptibility to <i>V. dahliae</i>. Further, we investigated the interaction between GhPMEI3 and GhPME2/GhPME31 using inhibition assays and molecular docking simulations. The peculiar structural features of GhPMEI3 were responsible for the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with GhPME2/GhPME31. Together, these results suggest that GhPMEI3 enhances resistance to <i>Verticillium</i> wilt. Moreover, GhPMEI3-GhPMEs interactions would be needed before <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">draw</span></strong>ing the correlation between structure-function and are crucial for plant development against the ever-evolving fungal pathogens.</p>

The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) member ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE3 (RHD3) has been demonstrated to mediate ER membrane fusion, but how exactly RHD3 is involved in the process is still unknown. Here we conducted systemic structure-function analyses of roles of different RHD3 domains in mediating ER fusion. We showed that efficient ER membrane fusion mediated by RHD3 requires a proper dimerization of RHD3 through the GTPase domain (GD) and the first and second three helix bundles (3HBs) in the middle domain. RHD3 has a 3HB-enriched middle domain longer than that of Atlastins, and we revealed that the third and fourth 3HBs are required for the stability of RHD3. The transmembrane segments of RHD3 are essential for targeting and retention of RHD3 in the ER and can also facilitate an oligomerization of RHD3. Furthermore, we showed that an amphipathic helix in the C-terminal cytosolic tail of RHD3 has a membrane anchoring ability that is required for efficient ER membrane fusion mediated by RHD3. This work contributes to a better understanding of a coordinated action of RHD3 in the fusion of ER membranes.</p>

Regulation of Sucrose Transporters and Phloem Loading in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>Suc transporters (SUTs) play a key role in the allocation and partitioning of photosynthetically fixed carbon in plants. While a function could be assigned to many members of the SUT family, almost no information is available on their regulation. Here, the transcriptional regulation of SUTs in response to various environmental stimuli in the leaves of five dicots (Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>], soybean [<i>Glycine max</i>], potato [<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>], tomato [<i>Solanum</i> <i>lycopersicum</i>], and poplar [<i>Populus</i> spp.]) and four monocots (maize [<i>Zea</i> <i>mays</i>], rice [<i>Oryza sativa</i>], wheat [<i>Triticum aestivum</i>], and barley [<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>]) was investigated. Extensive data on expression of <i>SUT</i>s in relation to changes of environmental conditions were obtained through a global analysis of 168 transcriptomics data sets. Results were validated by quantitative PCR measurements and extended by the measurement of photosynthesis rate and phloem sugar content to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">draw</span></strong> insight on the correlation of <i>SUT</i> expression and sugar export from leaves. For the apoplasmic phloem loaders, a clear difference in transcriptional regulation in response to different environmental stimuli was observed. The consistent patterns of <i>SUT</i> expression under abiotic stress indicates which types of SUTs are involved in the regulation of leaf sugar status and in stress signaling. Furthermore, it is shown that down-regulation of phloem loading is likely to be caused by transcriptional regulation of SUTs, while up-regulation depends on post-transcriptional regulation. In poplar, expression of <i>PtaSUT4</i> was found to consistently respond to environmental stimuli, suggesting a significant role in the regulation of sugar export from leaves in this passive symplasmic phloem loader.</p>

Auxin and ROP GTPase Signaling of Polar Nuclear Migration in Root Epidermal Hair Cells
<p>Polar nuclear migration is crucial during the development of diverse eukaryotes. In plants, root hair growth requires polar nuclear migration into the outgrowing hair. However, knowledge about the dynamics and the regulatory mechanisms underlying nuclear movements in root epidermal cells remains limited. Here, we show that both auxin and Rho-of-Plant (ROP) signaling modulate polar nuclear position at the inner epidermal plasma membrane domain oriented to the cortical cells during cell elongation as well as subsequent polar nuclear movement to the outer domain into the emerging hair <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bulg</span></strong>e in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Auxin signaling via the nuclear AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE ACETIC ACID7 pathway ensures correct nuclear placement toward the inner membrane domain. Moreover, precise inner nuclear placement relies on SPIKE1 Rho-GEF, SUPERCENTIPEDE1 Rho-GDI, and ACTIN7 (ACT7) function and to a lesser extent on VTI11 vacuolar SNARE activity. Strikingly, the directionality and/or velocity of outer polar nuclear migration into the hair outgrowth along actin strands also are ACT7 dependent, auxin sensitive, and regulated by ROP signaling. Thus, our findings provide a founding framework revealing auxin and ROP signaling of inner polar nuclear position with some contribution by vacuolar morphology and of actin-dependent outer polar nuclear migration in root epidermal hair cells.</p>

SDH6 and SDH7 Contribute to Anchoring Succinate Dehydrogenase to the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The succinate dehydrogenase complex (complex II) is a highly conserved protein complex composed of the SDH1 to SDH4 subunits in bacteria and in the mitochondria of animals and fungi. The reason for the occurrence of up to four additional subunits in complex II of plants, termed SDH5 to SDH8, so far is a mystery. Here, we present a biochemical approach to investigate the internal subunit arrangement of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) complex II. Using low-concentration detergent treatments, the holo complex is dissected into subcomplexes that are analyzed by a three-dimensional gel electrophoresis system. Protein identifications by mass spectrometry revealed that the largest subcomplex (IIa) represents the succinate dehydrogenase domain composed of SDH1 and SDH2. Another subcomplex (IIb) is composed of the SDH3, SDH4, SDH6, and SDH7 subunits. All four proteins include transmembrane helices and together form the membrane anchor of complex II. Sequence analysis revealed that SDH3 and SDH4 lack helices conserved in other organisms. Using homology modeling and phylogenetic analyses, we present evidence that SDH6 and SDH7 substitute missing sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>es of SDH3 and SDH4 in plants. Together with SDH5, which is liberated upon dissection of complex II into subcomplexes, SDH6 and SDH7 also add some hydrophilic mass to plant complex II, which possibly inserts further functions into this smallest protein complex of the oxidative phosphorylation system (which is not so small in plants).</p>

Carotenogenesis Is Regulated by 5′UTR-Mediated Translation of Phytoene Synthase Splice Variants
<p>Phytoene synthase (PSY) catalyzes the highly regulated, frequently rate-limiting synthesis of the first biosynthetically formed carotene. While <i>PSY</i> constitutes a small gene family in most plant taxa, the Brassicaceae, including Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), predominantly possess a single <i>PSY</i> gene. This monogenic situation is compensated by the differential expression of two alternative splice variants (ASV), which differ in length and in the exon/intron retention of their 5′UTRs. ASV1 contains a long 5′UTR (untranslated region) and is involved in developmentally regulated carotenoid formation, such as during deetiolation. ASV2 contains a short 5′UTR and is preferentially induced when an immediate increase in the carotenoid pathway flux is required, such as under salt stress or upon sudden light intensity changes. We show that the long 5′UTR of ASV1 is capable of attenuating the translational activity in response to high carotenoid pathway fluxes. This function resides in a defined 5′UTR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong> with two predicted interconvertible RNA conformations, as known from riboswitches, which might act as a flux sensor. The translation-inhibitory structure is absent from the short 5′UTR of ASV2 allowing to bypass translational inhibition under conditions requiring rapidly increased pathway fluxes. The mechanism is not found in the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>PSY1</i> 5′UTR, consistent with the prevalence of transcriptional control mechanisms in taxa with multiple <i>PSY</i> genes. The translational control mechanism identified is interpreted in terms of flux adjustments needed in response to retrograde signals stemming from intermediates of the plastid-localized carotenoid biosynthesis pathway.</p>

Building Phylogenetic Trees from Molecular Data with MEGA
<p>Phylogenetic analysis is sometimes regarded as being an intimidating, complex process that requires expertise and years of experience. In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. <i>Mol Biol Evol</i>. 28:2731–2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">draw</span></strong>ing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence. MEGA is available for use on PCs and Macs from <ext-link>www.megasoftware.net</ext-link>.</p>

Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), open tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional open vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The open vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial integrity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, open tunnel EVH, and open vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stretch</span></strong>ing were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for open tunnel EVH compared with open vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for open tunnel EVH, and 6% for open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed tunnel EVH. High-level experience with endoscopic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

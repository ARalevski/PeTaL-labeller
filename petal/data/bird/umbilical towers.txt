Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

Hip revision arthroplasty for failed osteosynthesis in periprosthetic Vancouver type B1 fractures using a cementless, modular, tapered revision stem
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the hypothesis that failed osteosynthesis of periprosthetic   Vancouver type B1 fractures can be treated successfully with stem   revision using a transfemoral approach and a cementless, modular,   tapered revision stem with reproducible rates of fracture healing,   stability of the revision stem, and clinically good results.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 14 patients (11 women, three men) with a mean age   of 72.4 years (65 to 90) undergoing revision hip arthroplasty after   failed osteosynthesis of periprosthetic fractures of Vancouver type   B1 were treated using a transfemoral approach to remove the well-fixed   stem before insertion of a modular, fluted titanium stem which obtained   distal fixation. These patients were clinically and radiologically   followed up for a mean 52.2 months (24 to 144).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After a mean of 15.5 weeks (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   5.7) all fractures had healed. No stems subsided and bony-ingrowth   fixation had occurred according to the classification of Engh et   al. The mean Harris Hip Score increased from a pre-operative score   of 22.2 points (<sc>sd</sc> 9.7) to 81.5 points (<sc>sd</sc> 16.8)   24 months post-operatively. All hips had obtained an excellent result   according to the classification of Beals and Tower.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The technique described here for stem revision provides reproducibly   good results in the treatment of failed osteosynthesis for Vancouver   types B1 periprosthetic fractures of the hip.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B(4   Supple B):11–16.</p></sec>

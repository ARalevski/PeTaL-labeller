Variable Mesophyll Conductance among Soybean Cultivars Sets a Tradeoff between Photosynthesis and Water-Use-Efficiency
<p>Photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency is a critical determinant of crop yield potential, although it remains below the theoretical optimum in modern crop varieties. Enhancing mesophyll conductance (i.e. the rate of carbon dioxide diffusion from substomatal cavities to the sites of carboxylation) may increase photosynthetic and water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>encies. To improve water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, mesophyll conductance should be increased without concomitantly increasing stomatal conductance. Here, we partition the variance in mesophyll conductance to within- and among-cultivar components across soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) grown under both controlled and field conditions and examine the covariation of mesophyll conductance with photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, and leaf mass per area. We demonstrate that mesophyll conductance varies more than 2-fold and that 38% of this variation is due to cultivar identity. As expected, mesophyll conductance is positively correlated with photosynthetic rates. However, a strong positive correlation between mesophyll and stomatal conductance among cultivars apparently impedes positive scaling between mesophyll conductance and water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in soybean. Contrary to expectations, photosynthetic rates and mesophyll conductance both increased with increasing leaf mass per area. The presence of genetic variation for mesophyll conductance suggests that there is potential to increase photosynthesis and mesophyll conductance by selecting for greater leaf mass per area. Increasing water use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, though, is unlikely unless there is simultaneous stabilizing selection on stomatal conductance.</p>

Contemporary failure aetiologies of the primary, posterior-stabilised total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of revision total knee arthroplasties (TKA) that are   performed is expected to increase. However, previous reports of   the causes of failure after TKA are limited in that they report   the causes at specific institutions, which are often dependent on   referral patterns. Our aim was to report the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> indications   for re-operations and revisions in a large series of posterior-stabilised   TKAs undertaken at a single institution, excluding referrals from   elsewhere, which may bias the causes of failure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 5098 TKAs which were undertaken between 2000 and 2012   were included in the study. Re-operations, revisions with modular   component exchange, and revisions with non-modular component replacement   or removal were identified from the medical records. The mean follow-up   was five years (two to 12).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The Kaplan-Meier ten-year survival without a re-operation, modular   component revision and non-modular component revision was 95.7%,   99.3% and 95.3%, respectively.

Carrier lifetimes of >1 μs in Sn-Pb perovskites enable efficient all-perovskite tandem solar cells
<p>All-perovskite–based polycrystalline thin-film tandem solar cells have the potential to deliver <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>encies of >30%. However, the performance of all-perovskite–based tandem devices has been limited by the lack of high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, low–band gap tin-lead (Sn-Pb) mixed-perovskite solar cells (PSCs). We found that the addition of guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) resulted in marked improvements in the structural and optoelectronic properties of Sn-Pb mixed, low–band gap (~1.25 electron volt) perovskite films. The films have defect densities that are lower by a factor of 10, leading to carrier lifetimes of greater than 1 microsecond and diffusion lengths of 2.5 micrometers. These improved properties enable our demonstration of >20% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent low–band gap PSCs. When combined with wider–band gap PSCs, we achieve 25% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent four-terminal and 23.1% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent two-terminal all-perovskite–based polycrystalline thin-film tandem solar cells.</p>

Light-driven fine chemical production in yeast biohybrids
<p>Inorganic-biological hybrid systems have potential to be sustainable, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent, and versatile chemical synthesis platforms by integrating the light-harvesting properties of semiconductors with the synthetic potential of biological cells.

Giant nonlinear response at a plasmonic nanofocus drives efficient four-wave mixing
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent optical frequency mixing typically must accumulate over large interaction lengths because nonlinear responses in natural materials are inherently weak. This limits the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of mixing processes owing to the requirement of phase matching. Here, we report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent four-wave mixing (FWM) over micrometer-scale interaction lengths at telecommunications wavelengths on silicon. We used an integrated plasmonic gap waveguide that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer. The gap waveguide intensifies light by nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometers, thus generating a nonlinear response so strong that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent FWM accumulates over wavelength-scale distances. This technique opens up nonlinear optics to a regime of relaxed phase matching, with the possibility of compact, broadband, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent frequency mixing integrated with silicon photonics.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in plants could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most plants, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) plants overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects plant N use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency. The modified plants were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered plants allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type plants. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing plants displayed improved N uptake or utilization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control plants. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop plants with improved productivity as well as N use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in a range of N environments.</p>

Aperture effects in squid jet propulsion
<p>Squid are the largest jet propellers in nature as adults, but as paralarvae they are some of the smallest, faced with the inherent in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of jet propulsion at a low Reynolds number. In this study we describe the behavior and kinematics of locomotion in 1 mm paralarvae of <i>Dosidicus gigas</i>, the smallest squid yet studied. They swim with hop-and-sink behavior and can engage in fast jets by reducing the size of the mantle aperture during the contraction phase of a jetting cycle. We go on to explore the general effects of a variable mantle and funnel aperture in a theoretical model of jet propulsion scaled from the smallest (1 mm mantle length) to the largest (3 m) squid. Aperture reduction during mantle contraction increases propulsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency at all squid sizes, although 1 mm squid still suffer from low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency (20%) because of a limited speed of contraction. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency increases to a peak of 40% for 1 cm squid, then slowly declines. Squid larger than 6 cm must either reduce contraction speed or increase aperture size to maintain stress within maximal muscle tolerance. Ecological pressure to maintain maximum velocity may lead them to increase aperture size, which reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency. This effect might be ameliorated by nonaxial flow during the refill phase of the cycle. Our model's predictions highlight areas for future empirical work, and emphasize the existence of complex behavioral options for maximizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency at both very small and large sizes.</p>

Developmental phosphoproteomics identifies the kinase CK2 as a driver of Hedgehog signaling and a therapeutic target in medulloblastoma
<p>A major limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of drug resistance, which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the drug target or through intrinsic resistance of subpopulations of tumor cells. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> pediatric brain tumor, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and drug-resistant. To find new drug targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> resistance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>ly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 inhibitors decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB tumors that were resistant to currently available Hh inhibitors, thereby extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this drug may avoid at least one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> mode of acquired resistance. These findings suggest that CK2 inhibitors may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major mineral types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these minerals and the control that the leaf exerts over mineral deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the mineral locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the minerals, and mineral volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D mineral distribution that is preserved in different environments. The mineral distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency.</p>

Optimization of Light-Harvesting Pigment Improves Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>Maximizing light capture by light-harvesting pigment optimization represents an attractive but challenging strategy to improve photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency. Here, we report that loss of a previously uncharacterized gene, <i>HIGH PHOTOSYNTHETIC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ENCY1</i> (<i>HPE1</i>), optimizes light-harvesting pigments, leading to improved photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency and biomass production. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>hpe1</i> mutants show faster electron transport and increased contents of carbohydrates. <i>HPE1</i> encodes a chloroplast protein containing an RNA recognition motif that directly associates with and regulates the splicing of target RNAs of plastid genes. HPE1 also interacts with other plastid RNA-splicing factors, including CAF1 and OTP51, which share <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> targets with HPE1. Deficiency of HPE1 alters the expression of nucleus-encoded chlorophyll-related genes, probably through plastid-to-nucleus signaling, causing decreased total content of chlorophyll (<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>) in a limited range but increased chlorophyll <i>a</i>/<i>b</i> ratio. Interestingly, this adjustment of light-harvesting pigment reduces antenna size, improves light capture, decreases energy loss, mitigates photodamage, and enhances photosynthetic quantum yield during photosynthesis. Our findings suggest a novel strategy to optimize light-harvesting pigments that improves photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency and biomass production in higher plants.</p>

Common Genetic Variant Risk Score Is Associated With Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Drug-induced QT interval prolongation, a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications. The contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> genetic variants previously associated with baseline QT interval to drug-induced QT prolongation and arrhythmias is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that a weighted combination of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> genetic variants contributing to QT interval at baseline, identified through genome-wide association studies, can predict individual response to multiple QT-prolonging drugs. Genetic analysis of 22 subjects was performed in a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 3 QT-prolonging drugs with 15 time-matched QT and plasma drug concentration measurements. Subjects received single doses of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and placebo. The outcome was the correlation between a genetic QT score comprising 61 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> genetic variants and the slope of an individual subject’s drug-induced increase in heart rate–corrected QT (QTc) versus drug concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The genetic QT score was correlated with drug-induced QTc prolongation. Among white subjects, genetic QT score explained 30% of the variability in response to dofetilide (<i>r</i>=0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.81; <i>P</i>=0.02), 23% in response to quinidine (<i>r</i>=0.48; 95% confidence interval, −0.03 to 0.79; <i>P</i>=0.06), and 27% in response to ranolazine (<i>r</i>=0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.80; <i>P</i>=0.03).

Eliminating nonradiative decay in Cu(I) emitters: >99% quantum efficiency and microsecond lifetime
<p>Luminescent complexes of heavy metals such as iridium, platinum, and ruthenium play an important role in photocatalysis and energy conversion applications as well as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Achieving comparable performance from more–earth-abundant copper requires overcoming the weak spin-orbit coupling of the light metal as well as limiting the high reorganization energies typical in copper(I) [Cu(I)] complexes. Here we report that two-coordinate Cu(I) complexes with redox active ligands in coplanar conformation manifest suppressed nonradiative decay, reduced structural reorganization, and sufficient orbital overlap for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent charge transfer. We achieve photoluminescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>encies >99% and microsecond lifetimes, which lead to an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent blue-emitting OLED. Photophysical analysis and simulations reveal a temperature-dependent interplay between emissive singlet and triplet charge-transfer states and amide-localized triplet states.</p>

High-performance perovskite/Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> monolithic tandem solar cells
<p>The combination of hybrid perovskite and Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> (CIGS) has the potential for realizing high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency thin-film tandem solar cells because of the complementary tunable bandgaps and excellent photovoltaic properties of these materials. In tandem solar device architectures, the interconnecting layer plays a critical role in determining the overall cell performance, requiring both an effective electrical connection and high optical transparency. We used nanoscale interface engineering of the CIGS surface and a heavily doped poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) hole transport layer between the subcells that preserves open-circuit voltage and enhances both the fill factor and short-circuit current.

Light-induced lattice expansion leads to high-efficiency perovskite solar cells
<p>Light-induced structural dynamics plays a vital role in the physical properties, device performance, and stability of hybrid perovskite–based optoelectronic devices. We report that continuous light illumination leads to a uniform lattice expansion in hybrid perovskite thin films, which is critical for obtaining high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency photovoltaic devices. Correlated, in situ structural and device characterizations reveal that light-induced lattice expansion benefits the performances of a mixed-cation pure-halide planar device, boosting the power conversion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency from 18.5 to 20.5%. The lattice expansion leads to the relaxation of local lattice strain, which lowers the energetic barriers at the perovskite-contact interfaces, thus improving the open circuit voltage and fill factor. The light-induced lattice expansion did not compromise the stability of these high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency photovoltaic devices under continuous operation at full-spectrum 1-sun (100 milliwatts per square centimeter) illumination for more than 1500 hours.</p>

Designing river flows to improve food security futures in the Lower Mekong Basin
<p>Rivers provide unrivaled opportunity for clean energy via hydropower, but little is known about the potential impact of dam-building on the food security these rivers provide. In tropical rivers, rainfall drives a periodic flood pulse fueling fish production and delivering nutrition to more than 150 million people worldwide. Hydropower will modulate this flood pulse, thereby threatening food security. We identified variance components of the Mekong River flood pulse that predict yield in one of the largest freshwater fisheries in the world. We used these variance components to design an algorithm for a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed hydrograph to explore future yields. This algorithm mimics attributes of discharge variance that drive fishery yield: prolonged low flows followed by a short flood pulse.

A generic interface to reduce the efficiency-stability-cost gap of perovskite solar cells
<p>A major bottleneck delaying the further commercialization of thin-film solar cells based on hybrid organohalide lead perovskites is interface loss in state-of-the-art devices.

Tantalum-doped tungsten oxide (Ta-WO<i><sub>x</sub></i>)/conjugated polymer multilayers offer a surprisingly small interface barrier and form quasi-ohmic contacts universally with various scalable conjugated polymers. In a simple device with regular planar architecture and a self-assembled monolayer, Ta-WO<i><sub>x</sub></i>–doped interface–based perovskite solar cells achieve maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>encies of 21.2% and offer more than 1000 hours of light stability.

Perovskite solar cells with CuSCN hole extraction layers yield stabilized efficiencies greater than 20%
<p>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>encies greater than 20% have been realized only with expensive organic hole-transporting materials. We demonstrate PSCs that achieve stabilized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>encies exceeding 20% with copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) as the hole extraction layer. A fast solvent removal method enabled the creation of compact, highly conformal CuSCN layers that facilitate rapid carrier extraction and collection. The PSCs showed high thermal stability under long-term heating, although their operational stability was poor. This instability originated from potential-induced degradation of the CuSCN/Au contact. The addition of a conductive reduced graphene oxide spacer layer between CuSCN and gold allowed PSCs to retain >95% of their initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency after aging at a maximum power point for 1000 hours under full solar intensity at 60°C.

Global mRNA polarization regulates translation efficiency in the intestinal epithelium
<p>Asymmetric messenger RNA (mRNA) localization facilitates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent translation in cells such as neurons and fibroblasts. However, the extent and importance of mRNA polarization in epithelial tissues are unclear. Here, we used single-molecule transcript imaging and subcellular transcriptomics to uncover global apical-basal intracellular polarization of mRNA in the mouse intestinal epithelium. The localization of mRNAs did not generally overlap protein localization. Instead, ribosomes were more abundant on the apical sides, and apical transcripts were consequently more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ently translated. Refeeding of fasted mice elicited a basal-to-apical shift in polarization of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, which was associated with a specific boost in their translation. This led to increased protein production, required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent nutrient absorption. These findings reveal a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism involving dynamic polarization of mRNA and polarized translation.</p>

Key to this performance is their rapid and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent utilization of triplet states. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, we establish that luminescence via triplets occurs within 350 nanoseconds at ambient temperature, after reverse intersystem crossing to singlets. We find that molecular geometries exist at which the singlet-triplet energy gap (exchange energy) is close to zero, so that rapid interconversion is possible. Calculations indicate that exchange energy is tuned by relative rotation of the donor and acceptor moieties about the bridge. Unlike other systems with low exchange energy, substantial oscillator strength is sustained at the singlet-triplet degeneracy point.</p>

Tri-Hydroxy-Triacylglycerol Is Efficiently Produced by Position-Specific Castor Acyltransferases
<p>Understanding the biochemistry of triacylglycerol (TAG) assembly is critical in tailoring seed oils to produce high-value products. Hydroxy-fatty acid (HFA) is one such valuable modified fatty acid, which can be produced at low levels in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed through transgenic expression of the castor (<i>Ricinus communis</i>) hydroxylase. The resulting plants have low seed oil content and poor seedling establishment, indicating that Arabidopsis lacks <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent metabolic networks for biosynthesis and catabolism of hydroxy-containing TAG. To improve utilization of such substrates, we expressed three castor acyltransferase enzymes that incorporate HFA at each stereochemical position during TAG synthesis. This produced abundant tri-HFA TAG and concentrated 44% of seed HFA moieties into this one TAG species. Ricinoleic acid was more abundant than any other fatty acid in these seeds, which had 3-fold more HFA by weight than that in seeds following simple hydroxylase expression, the highest yet measured in a nonnative plant. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent utilization of hydroxy-containing lipid substrates increased the rate of TAG synthesis 2-fold, leading to complete relief of the low-oil phenotype. Partition of HFA into specific TAG molecules increased the storage lipid available for mobilization during seedling development, resulting in a 1.9-fold increase in seedling establishment. Expression of a complete acyltransferase pathway to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ently process HFA establishes a benchmark in the quest to successfully produce modified oils in plants.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale isotopic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

Unique Physiological and Transcriptional Shifts under Combinations of Salinity, Drought, and Heat
<p>Climate-change-driven stresses such as extreme temperatures, water deficit, and ion imbalance are projected to exacerbate and jeopardize global food security. Under field conditions, these stresses usually occur simultaneously and cause damages that exceed single stresses. Here, we investigated the transcriptional patterns and morpho-physiological acclimations of <i>Brachypodium dystachion</i> to single salinity, drought, and heat stresses, as well as their double and triple stress combinations. Hierarchical clustering analysis of morpho-physiological acclimations showed that several traits exhibited a gradually aggravating effect as plants were exposed to combined stresses. On the other hand, other morphological traits were dominated by salinity, while some physiological traits were shaped by heat stress. Response patterns of differentially expressed genes, under single and combined stresses (i.e. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> stress genes), were maintained only among 37% of the genes, indicating a limited expression consistency among partially overlapping stresses. A comparison between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> stress genes and genes that were uniquely expressed only under combined stresses (i.e. combination unique genes) revealed a significant shift from increased intensity to antagonistic responses, respectively. The different transcriptional signatures imply an alteration in the mode of action under combined stresses and limited ability to predict plant responses as different stresses are combined. Coexpression analysis coupled with enrichment analysis revealed that each gene subset was enriched with different biological processes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> stress genes were enriched with known stress response pathways, while combination unique-genes were enriched with unique processes and genes with unknown functions that hold the potential to improve stress tolerance and enhance cereal productivity under suboptimal field conditions.</p>

Solving the Towers of Hanoi – how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs transport networks
<p>Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and information. Biological networks must trade-off network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency with the risk of network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires modification. We used the slime mould <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> (Schwein) to study how the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while <i>P. polycephalum</i> is capable of building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the environment, <i>P. polycephalum</i> reconstructed more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent solutions, with all replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after network disruption. While <i>P. polycephalum</i> altered some of its existing network to accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from <i>P. polycephalum</i> with those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic environments.</p>

We investigated   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of open tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue injuries   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the injuries and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify any progression between   benign osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD), OFD-like adamantinoma and malignant   adamantinoma, and to investigate the rates of local recurrence,   metastases and survival, in order to develop treatment algorithms   for each.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A single institution retrospective review of all patients presenting   with OFD, OFD-like adamantinoma and adamantinoma between 1973 and   2012 was undertaken. Complete data were available for 73 patients   (42 with OFD; ten with an OFD-like adamantinoma and 21 with an adamantinoma).   The mean follow-up was 10.3 years (3 to 25) for OFD, 9.2 years (3.0   to 26.3) for OFD-like and 11.6 years (0.25 to 33) for adamantinoma.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age at diagnosis for OFD was 13.5 years (1 to 49), 10.5   years (6 to 28) for OFD-like and 34 years (14 to 86) for adamantinoma.   A total of 24 of the 42 patients with OFD (57%) have not required   any treatment and have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with observation. A total of   18 of the 42 patients with OFD underwent surgery, 13 with curettage   and five with resection. In all, three patients developed recurrence   following curettage (23%) but none following resection. All these   patients were cured with further limited surgery. A total of six   patients initially diagnosed with OFD were subsequently found to   have OFD-like adamantinoma. Of the ten patients initially diagnosed   with OFD-like adamantinoma, three (30%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with observation   alone and seven underwent surgery, two with curettage and five with   resection. Local recurrence arose in two patients, one each after   curettage and resection. No patients with either OFD or an OFD-like   adamantinoma developed metastases or had progression to adamantinoma.   All patients with an adamantinoma were treated by surgery, three   with curettage, six with amputation and 12 with excision. In all,   two of the three treated with curettage developed local recurrence, requiring   further surgery. Late development of both local recurrence and metastases   led to a ten year disease specific survival of 93% which had dropped   to 39% by 20 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found no evidence of progression from OFD to adamantinoma.   Conservative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement with observation or curettage is often successful   for patients with OFD and OFD-like adamantinoma. Resection with   clear margins is required for patients with adamantinoma. Late tumour   recurrence is not un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> in adamantinoma and prolonged follow-up   should be considered.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:409–16.</p></sec>

Complications following arthroscopic surgery of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The number of patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery of the   hip has increased significantly during the past decade. It has now   become an established technique for the treatment of many intra-   and extra-articular conditions affecting the hip. However, it has   a steep learning curve and is not without the risk of complications.   The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the prevalence   of complications during and following this procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses   guidelines were used in designing this study. Two reviewers systematically   searched the literature for complications related to arthroscopy   of the hip. The research question and eligibility criteria were   established <i>a priori</i>. Pertinent data were abstracted   and analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found 276 relevant studies with a total of 36 761 arthroscopies   that met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the patients was   36.7 years (1.7 to 70) and the mean body mass index was 25.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (20.2   to 29.2). Femoroacetabular impingement and labral tears were the   most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> indications for the procedure. The total number of complications   was 1222 (3.3%). Nerve injury (0.9%), mainly involving the pudendal   and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves, and iatrogenic chondral and   labral injury (0.7%), were the two most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> complications. There   were 58 major complications (0.2%), the most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> being intra-abdominal   extravasation of fluid, which was found in 13 cases (0.04%). There   were three deaths (0.008%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Arthroscopic surgery of the hip is a procedure with a relatively   low rate of complications, although some may be significant in this   young cohort of patients. This study relied on the reported complications   only and the results should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1577–83.</p></sec>

Myxofibrosarcoma of the extremity and trunk
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Myxofibrosarcomas (MFSs) are malignant soft-tissue sarcomas characteristically   presenting as painless slowly growing masses in the extremities.   Locally infiltrative growth means that the risk of local recurrence   is high.

Proximal femoral resection without post-operative traction for the painful dislocated hip in young patients with cerebral palsy
<p>Proximal femoral resection (PFR) is a proven   pain-relieving procedure for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of patients with severe cerebral   palsy and a painful displaced hip. Previous authors have recommended   post-operative traction or immobilisation to prevent a recurrence   of pain due to proximal migration of the femoral stump. We present   a series of 79 PFRs in 63 patients, age 14.7 years (10 to 26; 35   male, 28 female), none of whom had post-operative traction or immobilisation.</p><p>A total of 71 hips (89.6%) were reported to be pain free or to   have mild pain following surgery. Four children underwent further   resection for persistent pain; of these, three had successful resolution   of pain and one had no benefit. A total of 16 hips (20.2%) showed   radiographic evidence of heterotopic ossification, all of which   had formed within one year of surgery. Four patients had a wound   infection, one of which needed debridement; all recovered fully.   A total of 59 patients (94%) reported improvements in seating and   hygiene.</p><p>The results are as good as or better than the historical results   of using traction or immobilisation. We recommend that following   PFR, children can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed without traction or immobilisation,   and can be discharged earlier and with fewer complications. However,   care should be taken with severely dystonic patients, in whom more   extensive femoral resection should be considered in combination   with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of the increased tone.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014; 96-B:701–6.</p>

Fractures of the femoral shaft in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of closed   isolated fractures of the femoral shaft in children, and to compare   the treatment and length of stay (LOS) between major trauma centres   (MTCs) and trauma units (TUs) in England.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>National data were obtained from the Trauma and Audit Research   Network for all isolated, closed fractures of the femoral shaft   in children from birth to 15 years of age, between 2012 and 2015.   Age, gender, the season in which the fracture occurred, non-accidental   injury, the mechanism of injury, hospital trauma status, LOS and   type of treatment were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 1852 fractures were identified. The mean annual incidence   was 5.82 per 100 000 children (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.20   to 6.44).

Diagnostic Accuracy of the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score Plus D-Dimer for Acute Aortic Syndromes
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are rare and severe cardiovascular emergencies with unspecific symptoms. For AASs, both misdiagnosis and overtesting are key concerns, and standardized diagnostic strategies may help physicians to balance these risks. D-dimer (DD) is highly sensitive for AAS but is inadequate as a stand-alone test. Integration of pretest probability assessment with DD testing is feasible, but the safety and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of such a diagnostic strategy are currently unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter prospective observational study involving 6 hospitals in 4 countries from 2014 to 2016, consecutive outpatients were eligible if they had ≥1 of the following: chest/abdominal/back pain, syncope, perfusion deficit, and if AAS was in the differential diagnosis. The tool for pretest probability assessment was the aortic dissection detection risk score (ADD-RS, 0–3) per current guidelines. DD was considered negative (DD−) if <500 ng/mL. Final case adjudication was based on conclusive diagnostic imaging, autopsy, surgery, or 14-day follow-up. Outcomes were the failure rate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of a diagnostic strategy for ruling out AAS in patients with ADD-RS=0/DD− or ADD-RS ≤1/DD−.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 1850 patients were analyzed. Of these, 438 patients (24%) had ADD-RS=0, 1071 patients (58%) had ADD-RS=1, and 341 patients (18%) had ADD-RS >1. Two hundred forty-one patients (13%) had AAS: 125 had type A aortic dissection, 53 had type B aortic dissection, 35 had intramural aortic hematoma, 18 had aortic rupture, and 10 had penetrating aortic ulcer. A positive DD test result had an overall sensitivity of 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 93.6–98.6) and a specificity of 64% (95% CI, 61.6–66.4) for the diagnosis of AAS; 8 patients with AAS had DD−. In 294 patients with ADD-RS=0/DD−, 1 case of AAS was observed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1.9) and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of 15.9% (95% CI, 14.3–17.6) for the ADD-RS=0/DD− strategy. In 924 patients with ADD-RS ≤1/DD−, 3 cases of AAS were observed. This yielded a failure rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1–1) and an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency of 49.9% (95% CI, 47.7–52.2) for the ADD-RS ≤1/DD− strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Integration of ADD-RS (either ADD-RS=0 or ADD-RS ≤1) with DD may be considered to standardize diagnostic rule out of AAS.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Neurological Injury and Cerebral Blood Flow in Single Ventricles Throughout Staged Surgical Reconstruction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with a single ventricle experience a high rate of brain injury and adverse neurodevelopmental outcome; however, the incidence of brain abnormalities throughout surgical reconstruction and their relationship with cerebral blood flow, oxygen delivery, and carbon dioxide reactivity remain unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with a single ventricle were studied with magnetic resonance imaging scans immediately prior to bidirectional Glenn (pre-BDG), before Fontan (BDG), and then 3 to 9 months after Fontan reconstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>One hundred sixty-eight consecutive subjects recruited into the project underwent 235 scans: 63 pre-BDG (mean age, 4.8±1.7 months), 118 BDG (2.9±1.4 years), and 54 after Fontan (2.4±1.0 years). Nonacute ischemic white matter changes on T2-weighted imaging, focal tissue loss, and ventriculomegaly were all more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>ly detected in BDG and Fontan compared with pre-BDG patients (<i>P</i><0.05). BDG patients had significantly higher cerebral blood flow than did Fontan patients. The odds of discovering brain injury with adjustment for surgical stage as well as ≥2 coexisting lesions within a patient decreased (63%–75% and 44%, respectively) with increasing amount of cerebral blood flow (<i>P</i><0.05). In general, there was no association of oxygen delivery (except for ventriculomegaly in the BDG group) or carbon dioxide reactivity with neurological injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant brain abnormalities are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>ly present in patients with a single ventricle, and detection of these lesions increases as children progress through staged surgical reconstruction, with multiple coexisting lesions more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> earlier than later. In addition, this study demonstrated that BDG patients had greater cerebral blood flow than did Fontan patients and that an inverse association exists of various indexes of cerebral blood flow with these brain lesions.

Chemical Enhancement of In Vitro and In Vivo Direct Cardiac Reprogramming
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocyte-like cells in situ represents a promising strategy for cardiac regeneration. A combination of 3 cardiac transcription factors, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT), can convert fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocyte-like cells, albeit with low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We screened 5500 compounds in primary cardiac fibroblasts to identify the pathways that can be modulated to enhance cardiomyocyte reprogramming.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found that a combination of the transforming growth factor-β inhibitor SB431542 and the WNT inhibitor XAV939 increased reprogramming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency 8-fold when added to GMT-overexpressing cardiac fibroblasts. The small molecules also enhanced the speed and quality of cell conversion; we observed beating cells as early as 1 week after reprogramming compared with 6 to 8 weeks with GMT alone. In vivo, mice exposed to GMT, SB431542, and XAV939 for 2 weeks after myocardial infarction showed significantly improved reprogramming and cardiac function compared with those exposed to only GMT. Human cardiac reprogramming was similarly enhanced on transforming growth factor-β and WNT inhibition and was achieved most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ently with GMT plus myocardin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Transforming growth factor-β and WNT inhibitors jointly enhance GMT-induced direct cardiac reprogramming from cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo and provide a more robust platform for cardiac regeneration.</p></sec>

Diagnosis and Treatment of Fetal Cardiac Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The goal of this statement is to review available literature and to put forth a scientific statement on the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of fetal cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>A writing group appointed by the American Heart Association reviewed the available literature pertaining to topics relevant to fetal cardiac medicine, including the diagnosis of congenital heart disease and arrhythmias, assessment of cardiac function and the cardiovascular system, and available treatment options. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification of recommendations and level of evidence for practice guidelines were applied to the current practice of fetal cardiac medicine. Recommendations relating to the specifics of fetal diagnosis, including the timing of referral for study, indications for referral, and experience suggested for performance and interpretation of studies, are presented. The components of a fetal echocardiogram are described in detail, including descriptions of the assessment of cardiac anatomy, cardiac function, and rhythm. Complementary modalities for fetal cardiac assessment are reviewed, including the use of advanced ultrasound techniques, fetal magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal magnetocardiography and electrocardiography for rhythm assessment. Models for parental counseling and a discussion of parental stress and depression assessments are reviewed. Available fetal therapies, including medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement for arrhythmias or heart failure and closed or open intervention for diseases affecting the cardiovascular system such as twin–twin transfusion syndrome, lung masses, and vascular tumors, are highlighted. Catheter-based intervention strategies to prevent the progression of disease in utero are also discussed. Recommendations for delivery planning strategies for fetuses with congenital heart disease including models based on classification of disease severity and delivery room treatment will be highlighted. Outcome assessment is reviewed to show the benefit of prenatal diagnosis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement as they affect outcome for babies with congenital heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Fetal cardiac medicine has evolved considerably over the past 2 decades, predominantly in response to advances in imaging technology and innovations in therapies. The diagnosis of cardiac disease in the fetus is mostly made with ultrasound; however, new technologies, including 3- and 4-dimensional echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and fetal electrocardiography and magnetocardiography, are available. Medical and interventional treatments for select diseases and strategies for delivery room care enable stabilization of high-risk fetuses and contribute to improved outcomes.

Targeted mutagenesis using CRISPR/Cas system in medaka
<p>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system-based RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN) has recently emerged as a simple and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent tool for targeted genome editing. In this study, we showed successful targeted mutagenesis using RGENs in medaka, <i>Oryzias latipes</i>. Somatic and heritable mutations were induced with high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ency at the targeted genomic sequence on the <i>DJ-1</i> gene in embryos that had been injected with the single guide RNA (sgRNA) transcribed by a T7 promoter and capped RNA encoding a Cas9 nuclease. The sgRNAs that were designed for the target genomic sequences without the 5′ end of GG required by the T7 promoter induced the targeted mutations. This suggests that the RGEN can target any sequence adjacent to an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence, which occurs once every 8 bp. The off-target alterations at 2 genomic loci harboring double mismatches in the 18-bp targeting sequences were induced in the RGEN-injected embryos. However, we also found that the off-target effects could be reduced by lower dosages of sgRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that CRISPR/Cas-mediated RGENs may be an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">effici</span></strong>ent and flexible tool for genome editing in medaka.</p>

We   conducted an economic evaluation as part of this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Data for patients’ use of post-operative healthcare resources   and time taken to return to work were collected and costed using   publicly available sources. Health-related quality of life, assessed   using the Health Utilities Index Mark-3 (HUI-3), was used to derive   quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs and QALYs were compared   between LIPUS and control (a placebo device) from a payer and societal   perspective using non-parametric bootstrapping. All costs are reported   in 2015 Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With a cost per device of $3,995, the mean cost was significantly   higher for patients treated with LIPUS <i>versus</i> placebo   from a payer (mean increase = $3647, 95% confidence interval (CI)   $3244 to $4070; p < 0.001) or a societal perspective (mean increase   = $3425, 95% CI $1568 to $5283; p < 0.001). LIPUS did not provide   a significant benefit in terms of QALYs gained (mean difference   = 0.023 QALYs, 95% CI -0.035 to 0.069; p = 0.474). Incremental cost-effectiveness   ratios of LIPUS compared with placebo were $155 433/QALY from a   payer perspective and $146 006/QALY from a societal perspective.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>At the current price, LIPUS is not cost-effective for fresh tibial   fractures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with intramedullary nailing.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1526–32.</p></sec>

Outcomes following debridement, antibiotics and implant retention in the management of periprosthetic infections of the hip
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of the study were to review and analyse the reported   series of debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR)   in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of infected total hip arthroplasties (THAs) to   establish the overall success and the influencing factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Using a standardised recognised study protocol, meta-analysis   of observational studies in epidemiology guidelines, a comprehensive   review and analysis of the literature was performed. The primary   outcome measure was the success of treatment. The search strategy   and inclusion criteria which involved an assessment of quality yielded   39 articles for analysis, which included 1296 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The proportion of success following DAIR in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement of   an infected THA appeared to improve after 2004 with a pooled mean   proportion of success of 72.2%. For all reported series, from 1977   onwards, there was improved success with early debridement (<   7 days; 75.7%) and exchange of modular components (77.5%). There   was a statistically non-significant improvement if debridement was   performed within four weeks of the initial procedure (73.0%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The reported success following DAIR has improved since 2004.   The only determinants of outcome which we found were the timing   of debridement after the onset of symptoms of infection and the   exchange of modular components.</p><p>Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2017;99-B:1488–66.</p></sec>

Cemented total hip arthroplasty following acetabular fracture
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the outcomes of cemented total hip arthroplasty (THA)   following a fracture of the acetabulum, with evaluation of risk   factors and comparison with a patient group with no history of fracture. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 1992 and 2016, 49 patients (33 male) with mean age of   57 years (25 to 87) underwent cemented THA at a mean of 6.5 years   (0.1 to 25) following acetabular fracture. A total of 38 had undergone   surgical fixation and 11 had been treated non-operatively; 13 patients   died at a mean of 10.2 years after THA (0.6 to 19). Patients were   assessed pre-operatively, at one year and at final follow-up (mean   9.1 years, 0.5 to 23) using the Oxford Hip Score (OHS). Implant   survivorship was assessed. An age and gender-matched cohort of THAs   performed for non-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) or avascular necrosis   (AVN) (n = 98) were used to compare complications and patient-reported outcome   measures (PROMs).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean time from fracture to THA was significantly shorter   for patients with AVN    (2.2 years) or protrusio (2.2 years) than those with post-traumatic   OA (9.4 years) or infection (8.0 years) (p = 0.03). Nine contained   and four uncontained defects were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ed with autograft (n = 11),   bulk allograft (n = 1), or trabecular metal augment (n = 1). Initial   fracture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement (open reduction and internal fixation or non-operative),   timing of THA    (>/< one year), and age (>/< 55 years) had no significant   effect on OHS or ten-year survival. Six THAs were revised at mean   of 12 years (5 to 23) with ten-year all-cause survival of 92% (95%   confidence interval 80.8 to 100). THA complication rates (all complications,   heterotopic ossification, leg length discrepancy > 10 mm) were significantly higher   following acetabular fracture compared with atraumatic OA/AVN and   OHSs were inferior: one-year OHS    (35.7 v<i>ersus</i> 40.2, p = 0.026); and final follow-up   OHS (33.6 v<i>ersus</i> 40.9, p = 0.008). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion </title><p>Cemented THA is a reasonable option for the sequelae of acetabular   fracture. Higher complication rates and poorer PROMs, compared with   patients undergoing THA for atraumatic causes, reflects the complex   nature of these cases.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1399–1408.</p></sec>

The use of the distal radius and ulna classification for the prediction of growth
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We report the use of the distal radius and ulna (DRU) classification   for the prediction of peak growth (PG) and growth cessation (GC)   in 777 patients with idiopathic scoliosis. We compare this classification   with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>ly used parameters of maturity.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The following data were extracted from the patients’ records   and radiographs: chronological age, body height (BH), arm span (AS),   date of menarche, Risser sign, DRU grade and status of the phalangeal   and metacarpal physes. The mean rates of growth were recorded according   to each parameter of maturity. PG was defined as the summit of the curve   and GC as the plateau in deceleration of growth. The rates of growth   at PG and GC were used for analysis using receiver operating characteristic   (ROC) curves to determine the strength and cutoff values of the   parameters of growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The most specific grades for PG using the DRU classification   were radial grade 6 and ulnar grade 5, and for GC were radial grade   9 and ulnar grade 7. The DRU classification spanned both PG and   GC, enabling better prediction of these clinically relevant stages   than other methods. The rate of PG (≥ 0.7 cm/month) and GC (≤ 0.15   cm/month) was the same for girls and boys, in BH and AS measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to note that the DRU classification can   predict both PG and GC, providing evidence that it may aid the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">manag</span></strong>ement   of patients with idiopathic scoliosis.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1689–96.</p></sec>

Missing data may lead to changes in hip fracture database studies
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aims of this study were to characterize the frequency of   missing data in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program   (NSQIP) database and to determine how missing data can influence   the results of studies dealing with elderly patients with a fracture   of the hip.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients who underwent surgery for a fracture of the hip between   2005 and 2013 were identified from the NSQIP database and the percentage   of missing data was noted for demographics, comorbidities and laboratory   values. These variables were tested for association with ‘any adverse   event’ using multivariate regressions based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> ways of handling   missing data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 26 066 patients were identified. The rate of missing   data was up to 77.9% for many variables. Multivariate regressions   comparing three methods of handling missing data found different   risk factors for postoperative adverse events. Only seven of 35   identified risk factors (20%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> to all three analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Missing data is an important issue in national database studies   that researchers must consider when evaluating such investigations.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:226–32.</p></sec>

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other injuries to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong>ly associated   injuries to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">common</span></strong> patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   injuries related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion injuries to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for fractures of the navicular that gives associated injuries   involving the lateral column due consideration. We have shown that   this system is reliable and reproducible and have described the   rationale for the subsequent treatment of each type.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:176–82.</p></sec>

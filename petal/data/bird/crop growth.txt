The Wheat <i>Lr67</i> Gene from the Sugar Transport Protein 13 Family Confers Multipathogen Resistance in Barley
<p>Fungal pathogens are a major constraint to global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> production; hence, plant genes encoding pathogen resistance are important tools for combating disease. A few resistance genes identified to date provide partial, durable resistance to multiple pathogens and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and resistant alleles – G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in yeast as a high affinity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by ∼ 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in yeast was reduced when coexpressed with <i>Lr67res</i>. Stable transgenic <i>Lr67res</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> lines exhibited seedling resistance to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>-specific pathogens <i>Puccinia hordei</i> and <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>, which cause leaf rust and powdery mildew, respectively. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> plants expressing <i>Lr67res</i> exhibited early senescence and higher pathogenesis-related (<i>PR</i>) gene expression. Unlike previous observations implicating flavonoids in the resistance of transgenic sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) expressing <i>Lr34res</i>, another <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> multipathogen resistance gene, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> flavonoids are unlikely to have a role in Lr67res-mediated resistance. Similar to observations made in yeast, Lr67res reduced Glc uptake <i>in planta</i>. These results confirm that the pathway by which <i>Lr67res</i> confers resistance to fungal pathogens is conserved between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>.</p>

Development of Decreased-Gluten Wheat Enabled by Determination of the Genetic Basis of <i>lys3a</i> Barley
<p>Celiac disease is the most common food-induced enteropathy in humans, with a prevalence of approximately 1% worldwide. It is induced by digestion-resistant, proline- and glutamine-rich seed storage proteins, collectively referred to as gluten, found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). Related prolamins are present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) and rye (<i>Secale cereale</i>). The incidence of both celiac disease and a related condition called nonceliac gluten sensitivity is increasing. This has prompted efforts to identify methods of lowering gluten in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>, one of the most important cereal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s. Here, we used bulked segregant RNA sequencing and map-based cloning to identify the genetic lesion underlying a recessive, low-prolamin mutation (<i>lys3a</i>) in diploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>. We confirmed the mutant identity by complementing the <i>lys3a</i> mutant with a transgenic copy of the wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> gene and then used targeting-induced local lesions in genomes to identify induced single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the three homeologs of the corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> gene. Combining inactivating mutations in the three subgenomes of hexaploid bread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> in a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> line lowered gliadin and low-molecular-weight glutenin accumulation by 50% to 60% and increased free and protein-bound lysine by 33%.</p>

Wheat—the cereal abandoned by GM
<p>The sudden appearance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> diseases can cause an irreparable economic shock, particularly to smallholder farmers in developing countries. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> blast, for example, is a devastating fungal disease from South America, which emerged in Bangladesh in 2016 (<i>1</i>). It is currently controlled by quarantine but could easily spread to other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>-growing areas, which could threaten food security. Furthermore, widespread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> failure from stem rust has occurred in Kenya and Ethiopia. Recent advances could provide a solution to this problem through the rapid discovery and isolation of disease-resistance genes from wild relatives of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>, followed by their introduction by transformation into the elite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> varieties. There is, however, a barrier to such progress: <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>, a worldwide staple food, has become an orphan among genetically modified (GM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s.</p>

Evolution of the wheat blast fungus through functional losses in a host specificity determinant
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> blast first emerged in Brazil in the mid-1980s and has recently caused heavy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> losses in Asia. Here we show how this devastating pathogen evolved in Brazil. Genetic analysis of host species determinants in the blast fungus resulted in the cloning of avirulence genes <i>PWT3</i> and <i>PWT4</i>, whose gene products elicit defense in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> cultivars containing the corresponding resistance genes <i>Rwt3</i> and <i>Rwt4</i>. Studies on avirulence and resistance gene distributions, together with historical data on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> cultivation in Brazil, suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> blast emerged due to widespread deployment of <i>rwt3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (susceptible to <i>Lolium</i> isolates), followed by the loss of function of <i>PWT3</i>. This implies that the <i>rwt3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> served as a springboard for the host jump to common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>.</p>

Host-Induced Gene Silencing of the MAPKK Gene <i>PsFUZ7</i> Confers Stable Resistance to Wheat Stripe Rust<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful genetic tool to accelerate research in plant biotechnology and control biotic stresses by manipulating target gene expression. However, the potential of RNAi in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> to efficiently and durably control the devastating stripe rust fungus <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pst</i>) remained largely under explored so far. To address this issue, we generated transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) lines expressing dsRNA targeting <i>PsFUZ7</i> transcripts of <i>Pst</i>. We analyzed expression of <i>PsFUZ7</i> and related genes, and resistance traits of the transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> lines. We show that <i>PsFUZ7</i> is an important pathogenicity factor that regulates infection and development of <i>Pst</i>. A <i>PsFUZ7</i> RNAi construct stably expressed in two independent transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> lines confers strong resistance to <i>Pst</i>. <i>Pst</i> hyphal development is strongly restricted, and necrosis of plant cells in resistance responses was significantly induced. We conclude that trafficking of RNA molecules from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> plants to <i>Pst</i> may lead to a complex molecular dialogue between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> and the rust pathogen. Moreover, we confirm the RNAi-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> protection approaches can be used, to our knowledge, as a novel control strategy against rust pathogens in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>.</p>

A selective insecticidal protein from <i>Pseudomonas</i> for controlling corn rootworms
<p>The coleopteran insect western <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corn</span></strong> rootworm (WCR) (<i>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</i> LeConte) is a devastating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> pest in North America and Europe. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> plants that produce <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (<i>Bt</i>) proteins can limit insect infestation, some insect populations have evolved resistance to <i>Bt</i> proteins. Here we describe an insecticidal protein, designated IPD072Aa, that is isolated from <i>Pseudomonas chlororaphis.</i> Transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corn</span></strong> plants expressing IPD072Aa show protection from WCR insect injury under field conditions. IPD072Aa leaves several lepidopteran and hemipteran insect species unaffected but is effective in killing WCR larvae that are resistant to <i>Bt</i> proteins produced by currently available transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corn</span></strong>. IPD072Aa can be used to protect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corn</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s against WCRs.</p>

The Impacts of Fluctuating Light on Crop Performance
<p>Rapidly changing light conditions can reduce carbon gain and productivity in field <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s because photosynthetic responses to light fluctuations are not instantaneous. Plant responses to fluctuating light occur across levels of organizational complexity from entire canopies to the biochemistry of a single reaction and across orders of magnitude of time. Although light availability and variation at the top of the canopy are largely dependent on the solar angle and degree of cloudiness, lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> canopies rely more heavily on light in the form of sunflecks, the quantity of which depends mostly on canopy structure but also may be affected by wind. The ability of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s to respond rapidly to these variations in light intensity is restricted by the relatively slow opening/closing of stomata, activation/deactivation of C<sub>3</sub> cycle enzymes, and up-regulation/down-regulation of photoprotective processes. The metabolic complexity of C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s creates the apparently contradictory possibilities that C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s may be both more and less resilient than C<sub>3</sub> to dynamic light regimes, depending on the frequency at which these light fluctuations occur. We review the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these limitations to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in fluctuating light that have shown promise in improving the response times of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s-related processes to changes in light intensity.</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

Transcriptome Profiling of Wheat Inflorescence Development from Spikelet Initiation to Floral Patterning Identified Stage-Specific Regulatory Genes
<p>Early reproductive development in cereals is crucial for final grain number per spike and hence the yield potential of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>. To date, however, no systematic analyses of gene expression profiles during this important process have been conducted for common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>). Here, we studied the transcriptome profiles at four stages of early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> reproductive development, from spikelet initiation to floral organ differentiation. <i>K</i>-means clustering and stage-specific transcript identification detected dynamically expressed homeologs of important transcription regulators in spikelet and floral meristems that may be involved in spikelet initiation, floret meristem specification, and floral organ patterning, as inferred from their homologs in model plants. Small RNA transcriptome sequencing discovered key microRNAs that were differentially expressed during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> inflorescence development alongside their target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms for floral development may be conserved in cereals and Arabidopsis. Our analysis was further substantiated by the functional characterization of the <i>ARGONAUTE1d</i> (<i>AGO1d</i>) gene, which was initially expressed in stamen primordia and later in the tapetum during anther maturation. In agreement with its stage-specific expression pattern, the loss of function of the predominantly expressed B homeolog of <i>AGO1d</i> in a tetraploid durum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> mutant resulted in smaller anthers with more infertile pollens than the wild type and a reduced grain number per spike. Together, our work provides a first glimpse of the gene regulatory networks in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> inflorescence development that may be pivotal for floral and grain development, highlighting potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve future <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> yields.</p>

Correlations between Circadian Rhythms and Growth in Challenging Environments
<p>In plants, the circadian system controls a plethora of processes, many with agronomic importance, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, photoprotection, stomatal opening, and photoperiodic development, as well as molecular processes, such as gene expression. It has been suggested that modifying circadian rhythms may be a means to manipulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s to develop improved plants for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>e. However, there is very little information on how the clock influences the performance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> plants. We used a noninvasive, high-throughput technique, based on prompt chlorophyll fluorescence, to measure circadian rhythms and demonstrated that the technique works in a range of plants. Using fluorescence, we analyzed circadian rhythms in populations of wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> ssp. <i>spontaneum</i>) from widely different ecogeographical locations in the Southern Levant part of the Fertile Crescent, an area with a high proportion of the total genetic variation of wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>. Our results show that there is variability for circadian traits in the wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> lines. We observed that circadian period lengths were correlated with temperature and aspect at the sites of origin of the plants, while the amplitudes of the rhythms were correlated with soil composition. Thus, different environmental parameters may exert selection on circadian rhythms.</p>

The transcriptional landscape of polyploid wheat
<p>The coordinated expression of highly related homoeologous genes in polyploid species underlies the phenotypes of many of the world’s major <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s. Here we combine extensive gene expression datasets to produce a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of homoeolog expression patterns in hexaploid bread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>. Bias in homoeolog expression varies between tissues, with ~30% of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> homoeologs showing nonbalanced expression. We found expression asymmetries along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> chromosomes, with homoeologs showing the largest inter-tissue, inter-cultivar, and coding sequence variation, most often located in high-recombination distal ends of chromosomes. These transcriptionally dynamic genes potentially represent the first steps toward neo- or subfunctionalization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> homoeologs. Coexpression networks reveal extensive coordination of homoeologs throughout development and, alongside a detailed expression atlas, provide a framework to target candidate genes underpinning agronomic traits in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>.</p>

Wild emmer genome architecture and diversity elucidate wheat evolution and domestication

Retrotransposon Insertion and DNA Methylation Regulate Aluminum Tolerance in European Barley Accessions
<p>Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major stress factor limiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> productivity in acid soil. Although there is great genotypic variation in tolerance to Al toxicity, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report that, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), the fourth largest cereal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> produced in the world, both retrotransposon insertion and DNA methylation are involved in regulating differential Al tolerance. <i>HvAACT1</i> is a major gene responsible for citrate secretion from the roots for external detoxification of Al. A multiretrotransposon-like (MRL) sequence insertion at least 15.3 kb in length was detected in the upstream genomic region of <i>HvAACT1</i> that displayed promoter activity and significantly enhanced <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, especially in the root tips of Al-tolerant accessions. Furthermore, in a number of accessions with low levels of <i>HvAACT1</i> expression, this MRL insertion was present but highly methylated. Geographical analysis showed that accessions with this MRL insertion are distributed mainly in European areas with acid soils. Two wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> accessions were found to possess this MRL insertion, but with a high degree of methylation. These results indicate that the MRL insertion and its degree of DNA methylation influence <i>HvAACT1</i> expression and that demethylation of this MRL insertion, which facilitates adaptation to acid soils, occurred following <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> domestication. Moreover, our results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> accessions in East Asia and Europe have developed independent but equivalent strategies to withstand Al toxicity in acid soils.</p>

Ethylene Receptors Signal via a Noncanonical Pathway to Regulate Abscisic Acid Responses
<p>Ethylene is a gaseous plant hormone perceived by a family of receptors in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) including ETHYLENE RESPONSE1 (ETR1) and ETR2. Previously we showed that <i>etr1</i>-<i>6</i> loss-of-function plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ate better and <i>etr2</i>-<i>3</i> loss-of-function plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ate worse than wild-type under NaCl stress and in response to abscisic acid (ABA). In this study, we expanded these results by showing that ETR1 and ETR2 have contrasting roles in the control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation under a variety of inhibitory conditions for seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation such as treatment with KCl, CuSO<sub>4</sub>, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, and ethanol. Pharmacological and molecular biology results support a model where ETR1 and ETR2 are indirectly affecting the expression of genes encoding ABA signaling proteins to affect ABA sensitivity. The receiver domain of ETR1 is involved in this function in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation under these conditions and controlling the expression of genes encoding ABA signaling proteins. Epistasis analysis demonstrated that these contrasting roles of ETR1 and ETR2 do not require the canonical ethylene signaling pathway. To explore the importance of receptor-protein interactions, we conducted yeast two-hybrid screens using the cytosolic domains of ETR1 and ETR2 as bait. Unique interacting partners with either ETR1 or ETR2 were identified. We focused on three of these proteins and confirmed the interactions with receptors. Loss of these proteins led to faster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation in response to ABA, showing that they are involved in ABA responses. Thus, ETR1 and ETR2 have both ethylene-dependent and -independent roles in plant cells that affect responses to ABA.</p>

A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy
<p>Process-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> growth models are popular tools with which to analyze and understand the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> management, genotype-by-environment interactions, or climate change. The ability to predict leaf area development is critical to predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> growth, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering growth coordination rules between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant organs (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and sheaths, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to model the dynamics of canopy development. We found a unique relationship between laminae area and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and sheath areas also were found, highlighting the tight control of organ growth within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to develop a simulation model of leaf area dynamics at the canopy level that was integrated in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> model SiriusQuality. The model was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The model accurately predicts leaf area dynamics under different scenarios of nitrogen and water limitations. It accounted for 85%, 64%, and 73% of the variability of the surface area of leaf cohorts, total leaf area index, and total green area index, respectively. The process-based model of the dynamics of leaf area described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> growth.</p>

Wheat Vacuolar Iron Transporter TaVIT2 Transports Fe and Mn and Is Effective for Biofortification
<p>Increasing the intrinsic nutritional quality of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s, known as biofortification, is viewed as a sustainable approach to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies. In particular, iron deficiency anemia is a major global health issue, but the iron content of staple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) is difficult to change because of genetic complexity and homeostasis mechanisms. To identify target genes for the biofortification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>, we functionally characterized homologs of the <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER</i> (<i>VIT</i>). The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> genome contains two <i>VIT</i> paralogs, <i>TaVIT1</i> and <i>TaVIT2</i>, which have different expression patterns but are both low in the endosperm. TaVIT2, but not TaVIT1, was able to rescue the growth of a yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) mutant defective in vacuolar iron transport. TaVIT2 also complemented a manganese transporter mutant but not a vacuolar zinc transporter mutant. By overexpressing <i>TaVIT2</i> under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, we achieved a greater than 2-fold increase in iron in white flour fractions, exceeding minimum legal fortification levels in countries such as the United Kingdom. The antinutrient phytate was not increased and the iron in the white flour fraction was bioavailable in vitro, suggesting that food products made from the biofortified flour could contribute to improved iron nutrition. The single-gene approach impacted minimally on plant growth and also was effective in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Our results show that by enhancing vacuolar iron transport in the endosperm, this essential micronutrient accumulated in this tissue, bypassing existing homeostatic mechanisms.</p>

We show that the functional coupling of Suc cleavage by invertases and uptake of the released hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollination in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolocalization of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo support the functional coupling in supplying carbohydrates for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation and tube growth evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated expression. Detection of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk between male and female tissues and supported the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollination. Tissue-specific expression of an invertase inhibitor and addition of the chemical invertase inhibitor miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously available Suc into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ating pollen operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after cleavage by extracellular invertase. Reduction of extracellular invertase activity in pollen decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for pollen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation, whereas Suc is supporting tube growth, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulation of pollination by carbohydrates.</p>

Genetic Architecture of Flowering-Time Variation in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transition to reproductive development is a crucial step in the plant life cycle, and the timing of this transition is an important factor in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> yields. Here, we report new insights into the genetic control of natural variation in flowering time in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a nondomesticated pooid grass closely related to cereals such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the rapid-flowering accession Bd21 and the delayed-flowering accession Bd1-1 were grown in a variety of environmental conditions to enable exploration of the genetic architecture of flowering time. A genotyping-by-sequencing approach was used to develop SNP markers for genetic map construction, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control differences in flowering time were identified. Many of the flowering-time QTLs are detected across a range of photoperiod and vernalization conditions, suggesting that the genetic control of flowering within this population is robust. The two major QTLs identified in undomesticated <i>B. distachyon</i> colocalize with <i>VERNALIZATION1/PHYTOCHROME C</i> and <i>VERNALIZATION2</i>, loci identified as flowering regulators in the domesticated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>. This suggests that variation in flowering time is controlled in part by a set of genes broadly conserved within pooid grasses.</p>

Increase in crop losses to insect pests in a warming climate
<p>Insect pests substantially reduce yields of three staple grains—rice, maize, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>—but models assessing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>al impacts of global warming rarely consider <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> losses to insects. We use established relationships between temperature and the population growth and metabolic rates of insects to estimate how and where climate warming will augment losses of rice, maize, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> to insects. Global yield losses of these grains are projected to increase by 10 to 25% per degree of global mean surface warming. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> losses will be most acute in areas where warming increases both population growth and metabolic rates of insects. These conditions are centered primarily in temperate regions, where most grain is produced.</p>

Improving photosynthesis and crop productivity by accelerating recovery from photoprotection
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> leaves in full sunlight dissipate damaging excess absorbed light energy as heat. When sunlit leaves are shaded by clouds or other leaves, this protective dissipation continues for many minutes and reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s.

An Ancestral Allele of <i>Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase1</i> Promotes Proline Accumulation and Drought Adaptation in Cultivated Barley
<p>Water scarcity is a critical threat to global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> production. Here, we used the natural diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) to dissect the genetic control of proline (Pro) mediated drought stress adaptation. Genetic mapping and positional cloning of a major drought-inducible quantitative trait locus (<i>QPro.S42-1H</i>) revealed unique allelic variation in <i>pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase</i> (<i>P5cs1</i>) between the cultivated cultivar Scarlett (ssp. <i>vulgare</i>) and the wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> accession ISR42-8 (ssp. <i>spontaneum</i>). The putative causative mutations were located in the promoter of <i>P5cs1</i> across the DNA binding motifs for abscisic acid-responsive element binding transcription factors. Introgression line (IL) S42IL-143 carrying the wild allele of <i>P5cs1</i> showed significant up-regulation of <i>P5cs1</i> expression compared to Scarlett, which was consistent with variation in Pro accumulation under drought. Next, we transiently expressed promoter::reporter constructs of ISR42-8 and Scarlett alleles in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mesophyll protoplasts. GUS expression analysis showed a significantly higher activation of the ISR42-8 promoter compared to Scarlett upon abscisic acid treatment. Notably, the ISR42-8 promoter activity was impaired in protoplasts isolated from the loss-of-function <i>abf1abf2abf3abf4</i> quadruple mutant. A series of phenotypic evaluations demonstrated that S42IL-143 maintained leaf water content and photosynthetic activity longer than Scarlett under drought. These findings suggest that the ancestral variant of <i>P5cs1</i> has the potential for drought tolerance and understanding drought physiology of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> and related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s.</p>

<i>Foxtail mosaic virus</i>: A Viral Vector for Protein Expression in Cereals
<p>Rapid and cost-effective virus-derived transient expression systems for plants are invaluable in elucidating gene function and are particularly useful in plant species for which transformation-based methods are unavailable or are too time and labor demanding, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The virus-mediated overexpression (VOX) vectors based on <i>Barley stripe mosaic virus</i> and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> streak mosaic virus</i> described previously for these species are incapable of expressing free recombinant proteins of more than 150 to 250 amino acids, are not suited for high-throughput screens, and have other limitations. In this study, we report the development of a VOX vector based on a monopartite single-stranded positive sense RNA virus, <i>Foxtail mosaic virus</i> (genus <i>Potexvirus</i>). In this vector, PV101, the gene of interest was inserted downstream of the duplicated subgenomic promoter of the viral c<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oat</span></strong> protein gene, and the corresponding protein was expressed in its free form. The vector allowed the expression of a 239-amino acid-long GFP in both virus-inoculated and upper uninoculated (systemic) leaves of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> and maize and directed the systemic expression of a larger approximately 600-amino acid protein, GUSPlus, in maize. Moreover, we demonstrated that PV101 can be used for in planta expression and functional analysis of apoplastic pathogen effector proteins such as the host-specific toxin ToxA of <i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i>.

<i>Rht18</i> Semidwarfism in Wheat Is Due to Increased <i>GA 2-oxidaseA9</i> Expression and Reduced GA Content
<p>Semidwarfing genes have improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> yield by reducing height, improving lodging resistance, and allowing plants to allocate more assimilates to grain growth. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), the <i>Rht18</i> semidwarfing gene was identified and deployed in durum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> before it was transferred into bread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>, where it was shown to have agronomic potential. <i>Rht18</i>, a dominant and gibberellin (GA) responsive mutant, is genetically and functionally distinct from the widely used GA-insensitive semidwarfing genes <i>Rht-B1b</i> and <i>Rht-D1b</i>. In this study, the <i>Rht18</i> gene was identified by mutagenizing the semidwarf durum cultivar Icaro (<i>Rht18</i>) and generating mutants with a range of tall phenotypes. Isolating and sequencing chromosome 6A of these “overgrowth” mutants showed that they contained independent mutations in the coding region of <i>GA2oxA9</i>. <i>GA2oxA9</i> is predicted to encode a GA 2-oxidase that metabolizes GA biosynthetic intermediates into inactive products, effectively reducing the amount of bioactive GA (GA<sub>1</sub>). Functional analysis of the GA2oxA9 protein demonstrated that GA2oxA9 converts the intermediate GA<sub>12</sub> to the inactive metabolite GA<sub>110</sub>. Furthermore, <i>Rht18</i> showed higher expression of <i>GA2oxA9</i> and lower GA content compared with its tall parent. These data indicate that the increased expression of <i>GA2oxA9</i> in <i>Rht18</i> results in a reduction of both bioactive GA content and plant height. This study describes a height-reducing mechanism that can generate new genetic diversity for semidwarfism in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> by combining increased expression with mutations of specific amino acid residues in <i>GA2oxA9</i>.</p>

Stage-Specific Gene Profiling of Germinal Cells Helps Delineate the Mitosis/Meiosis Transition
<p>In flowering plants, germ lines are induced from somatic meristems within reproductive organs. Within anthers, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>al cell initials first undergo several rounds of mitotic proliferation before synchronously entering meiosis. Our understanding of the progression and the molecular basis of this mitosis to meiosis transition is still limited. Taking advantage of the correlation between anther length and premeiotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>al cell development in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), we studied the transcriptome dynamics of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>al cells at three sequential stages, mitotic archesporial cells, enlarging pollen mother cells at the premeiosis interphase, and pollen mother cells at the early prophase of meiosis, using laser microdissection-based expression profiling. Our analysis showed that cells undergoing the mitosis-meiosis switch exhibit robust transcriptional changes. The three stages are distinguished by the expression of genes encoding transcription factor subsets, meiotic chromosome recombination proteins, and distinct E3 ubiquitin ligases, respectively. The transcription level of genes encoding protein turnover machinery was significantly higher in these three stages of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>al cells than in mature pollen, parenchyma cells, or seedlings. Our experimental results further indicate that many meiotic genes are not only transcribed, but also translated prior to meiosis. We suggest that the enlarging pollen mother cells stage represents a crucial turning point from mitosis to meiosis for developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>al cells.</p>

SEIPIN Proteins Mediate Lipid Droplet Biogenesis to Promote Pollen Transmission and Reduce Seed Dormancy
<p>Lipid droplets (LDs) are ubiquitous organelles in plant cells, but their physiological roles are largely unknown. To gain insight into the function of LDs in plants, we have characterized the Arabidopsis homologs of SEIPIN proteins, which are crucial factors for LD biogenesis in yeast and animals. <i>SEIPIN1</i> is expressed almost exclusively in embryos, while <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> have broader expression profiles with maximal levels in embryos and pollen, where LDs accumulate most abundantly. Genetic analysis demonstrates that all three <i>SEIPINs</i> contribute to proper LD biogenesis in embryos, whereas in pollen, only <i>SEIPIN2</i> and <i>SEIPIN3</i> play a significant role. The double <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants accumulate extremely enlarged LDs in seeds and pollen, which hinders their subsequent mobilization during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation. Interestingly, electron microscopy analysis reveals the presence of nuclear LDs attached to type I nucleoplasmic reticulum in triple <i>seipin</i> mutant embryos, supporting that SEIPINs are essential for maintaining the correct polarity of LD budding at the nuclear envelope, restricting it to the outer membrane. In pollen, the perturbations in LD biogenesis and turnover are coupled to reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation in vitro and with lower fertilization efficiency in vivo. In seeds, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation per se is not affected in <i>seipin2 seipin3</i> and triple <i>seipin</i> mutants, but there is a striking increase in seed dormancy levels. Our findings reveal the relevance of SEIPIN-dependent LD biogenesis in pollen transmission and in adjusting the timing of seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation, two key adaptive traits of great importance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>e.</p>

Global Analysis of Gene Expression in Response to Whole-Chromosome Aneuploidy in Hexaploid Wheat
<p>Aneuploidy, a condition of unbalanced chromosome content, represents a large-effect mutation that bears significant relevance to human health and microbe adaptation. As such, extensive studies of aneuploidy have been conducted in unicellular model organisms and cancer cells. Aneuploidy also frequently is associated with plant polyploidization, but its impact on gene expression and its relevance to polyploid genome evolution/functional innovation remain largely unknown. Here, we used a panel of diverse types of whole-chromosome aneuploidy of hexaploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), all under the common genetic background of cv Chinese Spring, to systemically investigate the impact of aneuploidy on genome-, subgenome-, and chromosome-wide gene expression. Compared with prior findings in haploid or diploid aneuploid systems, we unravel additional and novel features of alteration in global gene expression resulting from the two major impacts of aneuploidy, cis- and trans-regulation, as well as dosage compensation. We show that the expression-altered genes map evenly along each chromosome, with no evidence for coregulating aggregated expression domains. However, chromosomes and subgenomes in hexaploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> are unequal in their responses to aneuploidy with respect to the number of genes being dysregulated. Strikingly, homeologous chromosomes do not differ from nonhomologous chromosomes in terms of aneuploidy-induced trans-acting effects, suggesting that the three constituent subgenomes of hexaploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> are largely uncoupled at the transcriptional level of gene regulation. Together, our findings shed new insights into the functional interplay between homeologous chromosomes and interactions between subgenomes in hexaploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>, which bear implications to further our understanding of allopolyploid genome evolution and efforts in breeding new allopolyploid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s.</p>

Transcriptome Association Identifies Regulators of Wheat Spike Architecture

For example, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> spikes vary considerably in the number of spikelets, which are specialized reproductive branches, and the number of florets, which are spikelet branches that produce seeds. The large and repetitive nature of the three homologous and highly similar subgenomes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> has impeded attempts at using genetic approaches to uncover beneficial alleles that can be utilized for yield improvement.

In combination with coexpression network analysis, we inferred the identities of genes related to spike complexity.

<p>Controlling the major auxin biosynthetic pathway to manipulate auxin content could be a target for genetic engineering of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s with desired traits, but little progress had been made because low or high auxin contents often cause developmental inhibition. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of bread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) to identify the Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1/Tryptophan Aminotransferase-Related (TAA1/TAR) genes that function in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of auxin biosynthesis. Sequence mining together with gene cloning identified 15 <i>TaTAR</i> genes, among which 12 and three genes were phylogenetically close to Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) AtTAR2 and AtTAR3, respectively. <i>TaTAR2.1</i> had the most abundant transcripts in the <i>TaTAR2</i> genes and was expressed mainly in roots and up-regulated by low nitrogen (N) availability. Knockdown of <i>TaTAR2.1</i> caused vegetative and reproductive deficiencies and impaired lateral root (LR) growth under both high- and low-N conditions. Overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> enhanced LR branching, plant height, spike number, grain yield, and aerial N accumulation under different N supply levels. In addition, overexpressing <i>TaTAR2.1-3A</i> in Arabidopsis elevated auxin accumulation in the primary root tip, LR tip, LR primordia, and cotyledon and hypocotyl and increased primary root length, visible LR number, and shoot fresh weight under high- and low-N conditions. Our results indicate that <i>TaTAR2.1</i> is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> growth and also shows potential for genetic engineering to reach the aim of improving the grain yield of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>.</p>

In this study, we demonstrate that miR156 controls bread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> plant architecture. We show that overexpression of tae-miR156 in bread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> cultivar Kenong199 leads to increased tiller number and severe defects in spikelet formation, probably due to the tae-miR156-mediated repression of a group of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE</i> (<i>SPL</i>) genes. Furthermore, we found that the expression of two genes <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i> (<i>TaTB1</i>) and <i>BARREN STALK1</i> (<i>TaBA1</i>), whose orthologous genes in diverse plant species play conserved roles in regulating plant architecture, is markedly reduced in the tae-miR156-OE bread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> plants. Significantly, we demonstrate that the strigolactone (SL) signaling repressor DWARF53 (TaD53), which physically associates with the transcriptional corepressor TOPLESS, can directly interact with the N-terminal domains of miR156-controlled TaSPL3/17. Most importantly, TaSPL3/17-mediated transcriptional activation of <i>TaBA1</i> and <i>TaTB1</i> can be largely repressed by TaD53 in the transient expression system. Our results reveal potential association between miR156-TaSPLs and SL signaling pathways during bread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> tillering and spikelet development.</p>

5′ to 3′ mRNA Decay Contributes to the Regulation of Arabidopsis Seed Germination by Dormancy
<p>The regulation of plant gene expression, necessary for development and adaptive responses, relies not only on RNA transcription but also on messenger RNA (mRNA) fate. To understand whether seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation relies on the degradation of specific subsets of mRNA, we investigated whether the 5′ to 3′ RNA decay machinery participated in the regulation of this process. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seeds of <i>exoribonuclease4</i> (<i>xrn4</i>) and <i>varicose</i> (<i>vcs</i>) mutants displayed distinct dormancy phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis <i>of xrn4-5</i> and <i>vcs-8</i> mutant seeds allowed us to identify genes that are likely to play a role in the control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation. Study of 5′ untranslated region features of these transcripts revealed that specific motifs, secondary energy, and GC content could play a role in their degradation by XRN4 and VCS, and Gene Ontology clustering revealed novel actors of seed dormancy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation. Several specific transcripts identified as being putative targets of XRN4 and VCS in seeds (<i>PECTIN LYASE-LIKE</i>, <i>ASPARTYL PROTEASE</i>, <i>DWD-HYPERSENSITIVE-TO-ABA3</i>, and <i>YELLOW STRIPE-LIKE5</i>) were further studied by reverse genetics, and their functional roles in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation process were confirmed by mutant analysis.

Substituted Phthalimide AC94377 Is a Selective Agonist of the Gibberellin Receptor GID1
<p>Gibberellin (GA) is a major plant hormone that regulates plant growth and development and is widely used as a plant growth regulator in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>al production. There is an increasing demand for function-limited GA mimics due to the limitations on the agronomical application of GA to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s, including GA’s high cost of producing and its leading to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s’ lodging. AC94377, a substituted phthalimide, is a chemical that mimics the growth-regulating activity of GAs in various plants, despite its structural difference. Although AC94377 is widely studied in many weeds and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s, its mode of action as a GA mimic is largely unknown. In this study, we confirmed that AC94377 displays GA-like activities in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and demonstrated that AC94377 binds to the Arabidopsis GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) receptor (AtGID1), forms the AtGID1-AC94377-DELLA complex, and induces the degradation of DELLA protein. Our results also indicated that AC94377 is selective for a specific subtype among three AtGID1s and that the selectivity of AC94377 is attributable to a single residue at the entrance to the hydrophobic pocket of GID1. We conclude that AC94377 is a GID1 agonist with selectivity for a specific subtype of GID1, which could be further developed and used as a function-limited regulator of plant growth in both basic study and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agricultur</span></strong>e.</p>

We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6: A Key Regulator of Na<sup>+</sup> Homeostasis during Germination
<p>Salinity impairs seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation and seedling establishment. We investigated the role of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR 6 (CAMTA6) in salinity stress responses during early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation. Compared with the wild type, the <i>camta6-4</i> and <i>camta6-5</i> mutants were more tolerant to NaCl and abscisic acid (ABA) and accumulated less Na<sup>+</sup>. In contrast, 4- to 11-d-old <i>camta6</i> seedlings were more sensitive to NaCl. In <i>camta6</i>, expression of <i>HIGH-AFFINITY K<sup>+</sup> TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>AtHKT1;1</i>), encoding an Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transporter, was restricted to the radicles and was not enhanced by NaCl or ABA. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation, the <i>camta6 hkt1</i> double mutant was as sensitive as the wild type and <i>hkt1</i> to NaCl, suggesting that HKT1;1 is crucial for the salt tolerance of <i>camta6</i>. An ABA response element in the <i>HKT1;1</i> promoter was found to be indispensable for the enhanced expression of the gene in response to NaCl and to ABA. Transcriptome analysis of the wild type and <i>camta6-5</i> with and without salt treatment revealed 1,020 up-regulated and 1,467 down-regulated salt-responsive genes in the wild type. Among these, 638 up-regulated and 1,242 down-regulated genes were classified as CAMTA6-dependent. Expression of several known salt stress-associated genes, including <i>SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE1</i> and <i>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> ANTIPORTER</i>, was impaired in <i>camta6</i> mutants. Bioinformatics analysis of the 5′ upstream sequences of the salt-responsive CAMTA6-dependent up-regulated genes revealed the CACGTGTC motif as the most prominent element, representing an ABA response element and a potential CAMTA-binding site. We suggest that CAMTA6 regulates, directly or indirectly, the expression of most of the salt-responsive genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ating seeds, including genes that are crucial for Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and salt stress tolerance.</p>

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host gene-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene interactions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong>-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

The Coiled-Coil NLR <i>Rph1</i>, Confers Leaf Rust Resistance in Barley Cultivar Sudan
<p>Unraveling and exploiting mechanisms of disease resistance in cereal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s is currently limited by their large repeat-rich genomes and the lack of genetic recombination or cultivar (cv)-specific sequence information. We cloned the first leaf rust resistance gene <i>Rph1</i> (<i>Rph1</i>.<i>a</i>) from cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) using “MutChromSeq,” a recently developed molecular genomics tool for the rapid cloning of genes in plants. Marker-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped <i>Rph1</i> to the short arm of chromosome 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> cv Morex reference assembly. A sodium azide mutant population in cv Sudan was generated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H chromosomes from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were sequenced and compared to identify candidate genes for the <i>Rph1</i> locus. MutChromSeq identified a single gene candidate encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger sequencing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate gene. Phylogenetic analysis determined that <i>Rph1</i> clustered separately from all previously cloned NLRs from the Triticeae and displayed highest sequence similarity (89%) with a homolog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) disease resistance protein 1 protein in <i>Triticum urartu</i>. In this study we determined the molecular basis for <i>Rph1</i>-mediated resistance in cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> enabling varietal improvement through diagnostic marker design, gene editing, and gene stacking technologies.</p>

Chloroplast Accumulation Response Enhances Leaf Photosynthesis and Plant Biomass Production
<p>Under high light intensity, chloroplasts avoid absorbing excess light by moving to anticlinal cell walls (avoidance response), but under low light intensity, chloroplasts accumulate along periclinal cell walls (accumulation response). In most plant species, these responses are induced by blue light and are mediated by the blue light photoreceptor, phototropin, which also regulates phototropism, leaf flattening, and stomatal opening. These phototropin-mediated responses could enhance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and biomass production. Here, using various Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in chloroplast movement, we demonstrated that the accumulation response enhances leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and plant biomass production. Conspicuously, <i>phototropin2</i> mutant plants specifically defective in the avoidance response but not in other phototropin-mediated responses displayed a constitutive accumulation response irrespective of light intensities, enhanced leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, and increased plant biomass production. Therefore, our findings provide clear experimental evidence of the importance of the chloroplast accumulation response in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and biomass production.</p>

Physio-Genetic Dissection of Dark-Induced Leaf Senescence and Timing Its Reversal in Barley
<p>Barley <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> model was analyzed for early and late events during the dark-induced leaf senescence (DILS) as well as for deciphering critical time limit for reversal of the senescence process. Chlorophyll fluorescence vitality index Rfd was determined as the earliest parameter that correlated well with the cessation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s prior to microautophagy symptoms, initiation of DNA degradation, and severalfold increase in the endonuclease <i>BNUC1.</i> DILS was found characterized by up-regulation of processes that enable recycling of degraded macromolecules and metabolites, including increased NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> remobilization, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and partial up-regulation of glyoxylate and tricarboxylate acid cycles. The most evident differences in gene medleys between DILS and developmental senescence included hormone-activated signaling pathways, lipid catabolic processes, carbohydrate metabolic processes, low-affinity ammonia remobilization, and RNA methylation. The mega-autophagy symptoms were apparent much later, specifically on day 10 of DILS, when disruption of organelles—nucleus and mitochondria —became evident. Also, during this latter-stage programmed cell death processes, namely, shrinking of the protoplast, tonoplast interruption, and vacuole breakdown, chromatin condensation, more DNA fragmentation, and disintegration of the cell membrane were prominent. Reversal of DILS by re-exposure of the plants from dark to light was possible until but not later than day 7 of dark exposure and was accompanied by regained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, increase in chlorophyll, and reversal of Rfd, despite activation of macro-autophagy-related genes.</p>

Functional Diversity of Diterpene Synthases in the Biofuel Crop Switchgrass
<p>Diterpenoids constitute a diverse class of metabolites with critical functions in plant development, defense, and ecological adaptation. Major monocot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s, such as maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), deploy diverse blends of specialized diterpenoids as core components of biotic and abiotic stress resilience. Here, we describe the genome-wide identification and functional characterization of stress-related diterpene synthases (diTPSs) in the dedicated bioenergy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>). Mining of the allotetraploid switchgrass genome identified an expansive diTPS family of 31 members, and biochemical analysis of 11 diTPSs revealed a modular metabolic network producing a diverse array of diterpenoid metabolites. In addition to <i>ent</i>-copalyl diphosphate (CPP) and <i>ent</i>-kaurene synthases predictably involved in gibberellin biosynthesis, we identified <i>syn</i>-CPP and <i>ent</i>-labda-13-en-8-ol diphosphate (LPP) synthases as well as two diTPSs forming (+)-labda-8,13<i>E</i>-dienyl diphosphate (8,13-CPP) and <i>ent-neo-</i>cis-trans-clerodienyl diphosphate (CT-CLPP) scaffolds not observed previously in plants. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the (+)-8,13-CPP and <i>ent-neo-</i>CT-CLPP synthases revealed residue substitutions in the active sites that altered product outcome, representing potential neofunctionalization events that occurred during diversification of the switchgrass diTPS family. The conversion of <i>ent</i>-CPP, <i>ent</i>-LPP, <i>syn</i>-CPP, and <i>ent-neo</i>-CT-CLPP by promiscuous diTPSs further yielded distinct labdane-type diterpene olefins and alcohols. Of these metabolites, the formation of 9β-hydroxy-<i>syn</i>-pimar-15-ene and the expression of the corresponding genes were induced in roots and leaves in response to oxidative stress and ultraviolet irradiation, indicating their possible roles in abiotic stress adaptation. Together, these findings expand the known chemical space of diterpenoid metabolism in monocot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s toward systematically investigating and ultimately improving stress resilience traits in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> species.</p>

Natural Variation within a Species for Traits Underpinning C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>Engineering C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s into C<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s could substantially increase their yield by alleviating photorespiratory losses. This objective is challenging because the C<sub>4</sub> pathway involves complex modifications to the biochemistry, cell biology, and anatomy of leaves. Forward genetics has provided limited insight into the mechanistic basis of these properties, and there have been no reports of significant quantitative intraspecific variation of C<sub>4</sub> attributes that would allow trait mapping. Here, we show that accessions of the C<sub>4</sub> species <i>Gynandropsis gynandra</i> collected from locations across Africa and Asia exhibit natural variation in key characteristics of C<sub>4</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. Variable traits include bundle sheath size and vein density, gas-exchange parameters, and carbon isotope discrimination associated with the C<sub>4</sub> state. The abundance of transcripts encoding core enzymes of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle also showed significant variation. Traits relating to water use showed more quantitative variation than those associated with carbon assimilation. We propose that variation in these traits likely adapted the hydraulic system for increased water use efficiency rather than improving carbon fixation, indicating that selection pressure may drive C<sub>4</sub> diversity in <i>G. gynandra</i> by modifying water use rather than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. The accessions analyzed can be easily crossed and produce fertile offspring. Our findings, therefore, indicate that natural variation within this C<sub>4</sub> species is sufficiently large to allow genetic mapping of key C<sub>4</sub> traits and regulators.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, when the rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application concentrations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen concentrations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

Suboptimal Acclimation of Photosynthesis to Light in Wheat Canopies<sup>[CC-BY]</sup>
<p>Photosynthetic acclimation (photoacclimation) is the process whereby leaves alter their morphology and/or biochemistry to optimize photosynthetic efficiency and productivity according to long-term changes in the light environment. The three-dimensional architecture of plant canopies imposes complex light dynamics, but the drivers for photoacclimation in such fluctuating environments are poorly understood. A technique for high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction was combined with ray tracing to simulate a daily time course of radiation profiles for architecturally contrasting field-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) canopies. An empirical model of photoacclimation was adapted to predict the optimal distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s according to the fluctuating light patterns throughout the canopies. While the photoacclimation model output showed good correlation with field-measured gas-exchange data at the top of the canopy, it predicted a lower optimal light-saturated rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s at the base. Leaf Rubisco and protein contents were consistent with the measured optimal light-saturated rate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. We conclude that, although the photosynthetic capacity of leaves is high enough to exploit brief periods of high light within the canopy (particularly toward the base), the frequency and duration of such sunflecks are too small to make acclimation a viable strategy in terms of carbon gain. This suboptimal acclimation renders a large portion of residual photosynthetic capacity unused and reduces photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency at the canopy level, with further implications for photosynthetic productivity. It is argued that (1) this represents an untapped source of photosynthetic potential and (2) canopy nitrogen could be lowered with no detriment to carbon gain or grain protein content.</p>

Extreme Suppression of Lateral Floret Development by a Single Amino Acid Change in the VRS1 Transcription Factor
<p>Increasing grain yield is an endless challenge for cereal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> breeding. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>), grain number is controlled mainly by <i>Six-rowed spike 1</i> (<i>Vrs1</i>), which encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper class I transcription factor. However, little is known about the genetic basis of grain size. Here, we show that extreme suppression of lateral florets contributes to enlarged grains in <i>deficiens</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>. Through a combination of fine-mapping and resequencing of <i>deficiens</i> mutants, we have identified that a single amino acid substitution at a putative phosphorylation site in VRS1 is responsible for the <i>deficiens</i> phenotype. <i>deficiens</i> mutant alleles confer an increase in grain size, a reduction in plant height, and a significant increase in thousand grain weight in contemporary cultivated germplasm. Haplotype analysis revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> carrying the <i>deficiens</i> allele (<i>Vrs1.t1</i>) originated from two-rowed types carrying the <i>Vrs1.b2</i> allele, predominantly found in germplasm from northern Africa. In situ hybridization of <i>histone H4</i>, a marker for cell cycle or proliferation, showed weaker expression in the lateral spikelets compared with central spikelets in <i>deficiens</i>. Transcriptome analysis revealed that a number of <i>histone</i> superfamily genes were up-regulated in the <i>deficiens</i> mutant, suggesting that enhanced cell proliferation in the central spikelet may contribute to larger grains. Our data suggest that grain yield can be improved by suppressing the development of specific organs that are not positively involved in sink/source relationships.</p>

MiR408 Regulates Grain Yield and Photosynthesis via a Phytocyanin Protein
<p>Increasing grain yield is the most important object of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> breeding. Here, we report that the elevated expression of a conserved microRNA, OsmiR408, could positively regulate grain yield in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) by increasing panicle branches and grain number. We further showed that OsmiR408 regulates grain yield by down-regulating its downstream target, <i>OsUCL8</i>, which is an uclacyanin (UCL) gene of the phytocyanin family. The knock down or knock out of <i>OsUCL8</i> also increases grain yield, while the overexpression of <i>OsUCL8</i> results in an opposite phenotype. Spatial and temporal expression analyses showed that <i>OsUCL8</i> was highly expressed in pistils, young panicles, developing seeds, and inflorescence meristem and was nearly complementary to that of OsmiR408. Interestingly, the OsUCL8 protein was localized to the cytoplasm, distinct from a majority of phytocyanins, which localize to the plasma membrane. Further studies revealed that the cleavage of <i>OsUCL8</i> by miR408 affects copper homeostasis in the plant cell, which, in turn, affects the abundance of plastocyanin proteins and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s in rice. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the effects of miR408-<i>OsUCL8</i> in regulating rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s and grain yield.

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photosynthesi</span></strong>s. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield potential.</p>

AtAIRP2 E3 Ligase Affects ABA and High-Salinity Responses by Stimulating Its ATP1/SDIRIP1 Substrate Turnover
<p>AtAIRP2 is a cytosolic RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that positively regulates an abscisic acid (ABA) response in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Yeast two-hybrid screening using AtAIRP2 as bait identified ATP1 (AtAIRP2 Target Protein1) as a substrate of AtAIRP2. ATP1 was found to be identical to SDIRIP1, which was reported recently to be a negative factor in ABA signaling and a target protein of the RING E3 ligase SDIR1. Accordingly, ATP1 was renamed ATP1/SDIRIP1. A specific interaction between AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 and ubiquitination of ATP1/SDIRIP1 by AtAIRP2 were demonstrated in vitro and in planta. The turnover of ATP1/SDIRIP1 was regulated by AtAIRP2 in cell-free degradation and protoplast cotransfection assays. The ABA-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation assay of <i>35S</i>:<i>ATP1/SDIRIP1-RNAi/atairp2</i> double mutant progeny revealed that ATP1/SDIRIP1 acts downstream of AtAIRP2. AtAIRP2 and SDIR1 reciprocally complemented the ABA- and salt-insensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation phenotypes of <i>sdir1</i> and <i>atairp2</i> mutants, respectively, indicating their combinatory roles in seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation. Subcellular localization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments in the presence of MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, showed that AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 were colocalized to the cytosolic spherical body, which lies in close proximity to the nucleus, in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaf cells. The 26S proteasome subunits RPN12a and RPT1 and the molecular chaperones HSP70 and HSP101 were colocalized to these discrete punctae-like structures. These results raised the possibility that AtAIRP2 and ATP1/SDIRIP1 interact in the cytosolic spherical compartment. Collectively, our data suggest that the down-regulation of ATP1/SDIRIP1 by AtAIRP2 and SDIR1 RING E3 ubiquitin ligases is critical for ABA and high-salinity responses during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation in Arabidopsis.</p>

Six-Rowed Spike3 (VRS3) Is a Histone Demethylase That Controls Lateral Spikelet Development in Barley
<p>The complex nature of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> genomes has long prohibited the efficient isolation of agronomically relevant genes. However, recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies provide new ways to accelerate fine-mapping and gene isolation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s. We used RNA sequencing of allelic <i>six-rowed spike3</i> (<i>vrs3</i>) mutants with altered spikelet development for gene identification and functional analysis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Variant calling in two allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed that <i>VRS3</i> encodes a putative histone Lys demethylase with a conserved zinc finger and Jumonji C and N domain. Sanger sequencing of this candidate gene in independent allelic <i>vrs3</i> mutants revealed a series of mutations in conserved domains, thus confirming our candidate as the <i>VRS3</i> gene and suggesting that the row type in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> is determined epigenetically. Global transcriptional profiling in developing shoot apical meristems of <i>vrs3</i> suggested that VRS3 acts as a transcriptional activator of the row-type genes <i>VRS1</i> (<i>Hv.HOMEOBOX1</i>) and <i>INTERMEDIUM-C</i> (<i>INT-C</i>; <i>Hv.TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>). Comparative transcriptome analysis of the row-type mutants <i>vrs3</i>, <i>vrs4</i> (<i>Hv.RAMOSA2</i>), and <i>int-c</i> confirmed that all three genes act as transcriptional activators of <i>VRS1</i> and quantitative variation in the expression levels of <i>VRS1</i> in these mutants correlated with differences in the number of developed lateral spikelets. The identification of genes and pathways affecting seed number in small grain cereals will enable to further unravel the transcriptional networks controlling this important yield component.</p>

Metal Tolerance Protein 8 Mediates Manganese Homeostasis and Iron Reallocation during Seed Development and Germination
<p>Metal accumulation in seeds is a prerequisite for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation and establishment of plants but also for micronutrient delivery to humans. To investigate metal transport processes and their interactions in seeds, we focused on METAL TOLERANCE PROTEIN8 (MTP8), a tonoplast transporter of the manganese (Mn) subclade of cation diffusion facilitators, which in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is expressed in embryos of seeds. The x-ray fluorescence imaging showed that expression of MTP8 was responsible for Mn localization in subepidermal cells on the abaxial side of the cotyledons and in cortical cells of the hypocotyl. Accordingly, under low Mn availability, MTP8 increased seed stores of Mn, required for efficient seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation. In mutant embryos lacking expression of <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER1</i> (<i>VIT1</i>), MTP8 built up iron (Fe) hotspots in <i>MTP8</i>-expressing cells types, suggesting that MTP8 transports Fe in addition to Mn. In <i>mtp8 vit1</i> double mutant seeds, Mn and Fe were distributed in all cell types of the embryo. An Fe transport function of MTP8 was confirmed by its ability to complement Fe hypersensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in vacuolar Fe transport. Imbibing <i>mtp8-1</i> mutant seeds in the presence of Mn or subjecting seeds to wet-dry cycles showed that MTP8 conferred Mn tolerance. During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation, MTP8 promoted reallocation of Fe from the vasculature. These results indicate that cell type-specific accumulation of Mn and Fe in seeds depends on MTP8 and that this transporter plays an important role in the generation of seed metal stores as well as for metal homeostasis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">germin</span></strong>ation efficiency under challenging environmental conditions.</p>

Night-Break Experiments Shed Light on the Photoperiod1-Mediated Flowering
<p>Plants utilize variation in day length (photoperiod) to anticipate seasonal changes. They respond by modulating their growth and development to maximize seed production, which in cereal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s is directly related to yield. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>), the acceleration of flowering under long days (LD) is dependent on the light induction of <i>PHOTOPERIOD1</i> (<i>PPD1</i>) by phytochromes. Under LD, <i>PPD1</i> activates <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T1</i> (<i>FT1</i>), a mobile signaling protein that travels from the leaves to the shoot apical meristem to promote flowering. Here, we show that the interruption of long nights by short pulses of light (“night-break” [NB]) accelerates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> flowering, suggesting that the duration of the night is critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wheat</span></strong> photoperiodic response. <i>PPD1</i> transcription was rapidly upregulated by NBs, and the magnitude of this induction increased with the length of darkness preceding the NB. Cycloheximide abolished the NB up-regulation of <i>PPD1</i>, suggesting that this process is dependent on active protein synthesis during darkness. While one NB was sufficient to induce <i>PPD1</i>, more than 15 NBs were required to induce high levels of <i>FT1</i> expression and a strong acceleration of flowering. Multiple NBs did not affect the expression of core circadian clock genes. The acceleration of flowering by NB disappeared in <i>ppd1-</i>null mutants, demonstrating that this response is mediated by <i>PPD1</i>. The acceleration of flowering was strongest when NBs were applied in the middle of the night, suggesting that in addition to <i>PPD1</i>, other circadian-controlled factors are required for the up-regulation of <i>FT1</i> expression and the acceleration of flowering.</p>

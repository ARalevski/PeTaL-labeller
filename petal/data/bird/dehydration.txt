Sugar Potentiation of Fatty Acid and Triacylglycerol Accumulation
<p>Photosynthetically derived sugar provides carbon skeletons for lipid biosynthesis. We used mutants of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and the expression of oleogenic factors to investigate relationships among sugar availability, lipid synthesis, and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in leaf tissue. The <i>adg1</i> mutation disables the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the first step in starch synthesis, and the <i>suc2</i> mutation disables a sucrose/proton symporter that facilitates sucrose loading from leaves into phloem. The <i>adg1suc2</i> double mutant increases glucose plus sucrose content in leaves 80-fold relative to the wild type, total fatty acid (FA) content 1.8-fold to 8.3% dry weight, and TAG more than 10-fold to 1.2% dry weight. The WRINKLED1 transcription factor also accumulates to higher levels in these leaves, and the rate of FA synthesis increases by 58%. Adding <i>tt4</i>, which disables chalcone synthase, had little effect, but adding the <i>tgd1</i> mutation, which disables an importer of lipids into plastids to create <i>adg1suc2tt4tgd1</i>, increased total leaf FA to 13.5% dry weight and TAG to 3.8% dry weight, demonstrating a synergistic effect upon combining these mutations. Combining <i>adg1suc2</i> with the <i>sdp1</i> mutation, deficient in the predominant TAG lipase, had little effect on total FA content but increased the TAG accumulation by 66% to 2% dry weight. Expression of the <i>WRINKLED1</i> transcription factor, along with <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> and the <i>OLEOSIN1</i> oil body-associated protein, in the <i>adg1suc2</i> mutant doubled leaf FA content and increased TAG content to 2.3% dry weight, a level 4.6-fold higher than that resulting from expression of the same factors in the wild type.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Massive blow-out craters formed by hydrate-controlled methane expulsion from the Arctic seafloor
<p>Widespread methane release from thawing Arctic gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>es is a major concern, yet the processes, sources, and fluxes involved remain unconstrained. We present geophysical data documenting a cluster of kilometer-wide craters and mounds from the Barents Sea floor associated with large-scale methane expulsion. Combined with ice sheet/gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>e modeling, our results indicate that during glaciation, natural gas migrated from underlying hydrocarbon reservoirs and was sequestered extensively as subglacial gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>es. Upon ice sheet retreat, methane from this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>e reservoir concentrated in massive mounds before being abruptly released to form craters. We propose that these processes were likely widespread across past glaciated petroleum provinces and that they also provide an analog for the potential future destabilization of subglacial gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>e reservoirs beneath contemporary ice sheets.</p>

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals dispersion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>ion extent. At tens of nanometers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>ion. At <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations of approximately one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>ion layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of ethane from its corresponding ethylene is an important, challenging, and energy-intensive process in the chemical industry. Here we report a microporous metal-organic framework, iron(III) peroxide 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate [Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) (dobdc<sup>4−</sup>: 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)], with iron (Fe)–peroxo sites for the preferential binding of ethane over ethylene and thus highly selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>.

Through a fixed-bed column packed with this porous material, polymer-grade ethylene (99.99% pure) can be straightforwardly produced from ethane/ethylene mixtures during the first adsorption cycle, demonstrating the potential of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for this important industrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation with a low energy cost under ambient conditions.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene

This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility.

Tree Physiology
Temperate tree species show identical response in tree water deficit but different sensitivities in sap flow to summer soil drying
<p>Temperate forests are expected to be particularly vulnerable to drought and soil drying because they are not adapted to such conditions and perform best in mesic environments. Here we ask (i) how sensitively four common temperate tree species (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> and <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) respond in their water relations to summer soil drying and seek to determine (ii) if species-specific responses to summer soil drying are related to the onset of declining water status across the four species. Throughout 2012 and 2013 we determined tree water deficit (TWD) as a proxy for tree water status from recorded stem radius changes and monitored sap flow rates with sensors on 16 mature trees studied in the field at Lageren, Switzerland. All tree species responded equally in their relative maximum TWD to the onset of declining soil moisture. This implies that the water supply of all tree species was affected by declining soil moisture and that none of the four species was able to fully maintain its water status, e.g., by access to alternative water sources in the soil. In contrast we found strong and highly species-specific responses of sap flow to declining soil moisture with the strongest decline in <i>P. abies</i> (92%), followed by <i>F. sylvatica</i> (53%) and <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> (48%). <i>F. excelsior</i> did not significantly reduce sap flow. We hypothesize the species-specific responses in sap flow to declining soil moisture that occur despite a simultaneous increase in relative TWD in all species reflect how fast these species approach critical levels of their water status, which is most likely influenced by species-specific traits determining the hydraulic properties of the species tree.</p>

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration
<p>Nanoporous two-dimensional materials are attractive for ionic and molecular nanofiltration but limited by insufficient mechanical strength over large areas. We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of atomically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water molecules while blocking solute ions or molecules to enable size-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The SWNT network physically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ates the GNM into microsized islands and acts as the microscopic framework to support the GNM, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the atomically thin GNM. The resulting GNM/SWNT membranes show high water permeance and a high rejection ratio for salt ions or organic molecules, and they retain stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation performance in tubular modules.</p>

However, their reliable and scalable manufacturing remains a challenge. We demonstrate the fabrication of ZIF nanocomposite membranes by means of an all-vapor-phase processing method based on atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO in a porous support followed by ligand-vapor treatment. After ALD, the obtained nanocomposite exhibits low flux and is not selective, whereas after ligand-vapor (2-methylimidazole) treatment, it is partially transformed to ZIF and shows stable performance with high mixture <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation factor for propylene over propane (an energy-intensive high-volume <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation) and high propylene flux.

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling
<p>The binding of DNA to cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) leads to the production of the secondary messenger cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP), which activates innate immune responses. We have shown that DNA binding to cGAS robustly induced the formation of liquidlike droplets in which cGAS was activated. The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation by increasing the valencies of DNA binding. Long DNA was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and cGAS enzyme activity than short DNA. Moreover, free zinc ions enhanced cGAS enzyme activity both in vitro and in cells by promoting cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. These results demonstrated that the DNA-induced phase transition of cGAS promotes cGAMP production and innate immune signaling.</p>

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with yeast prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical yeast prion protein Sup35. In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation followed by gelation. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH sensor domain. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation promoted yeast cell survival by rescuing the essential Sup35 translation factor from stress-induced damage. Thus, prion-like domains represent conserved environmental stress sensors that facilitate rapid adaptation in unstable environments by modifying protein phase behavior.</p>

Super-dry reforming of methane intensifies CO<sub>2</sub> utilization via Le Chatelier’s principle
<p>Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> transformation from a waste product to a carbon source for chemicals and fuels will require reaction conditions that effect its reduction. We developed a “super-dry” CH<sub>4</sub> reforming reaction for enhanced CO production from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. We used Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a CH<sub>4</sub>-reforming catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a solid oxygen carrier, and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a CO<sub>2</sub> sorbent. The isothermal coupling of these three different processes resulted in higher CO production as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding back reactions with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH<sub>4</sub> conversion to syngas over Ni and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction and storage as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is then used for iron reoxidation and CO production, exploiting equilibrium shifts effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier’s principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per CH<sub>4</sub> and offers a high CO space-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin.</p>

Plant diversity patterns in neotropical dry forests and their conservation implications
<p>Seasonally dry tropical forests are distributed across Latin America and the Caribbean and are highly threatened, with less than 10% of their original extent remaining in many countries. Using 835 inventories covering 4660 species of woody plants, we show marked floristic turnover among inventories and regions, which may be higher than in other neotropical biomes, such as savanna. Such high floristic turnover indicates that numerous conservation areas across many countries will be needed to protect the full diversity of tropical dry forests. Our results provide a scientific framework within which national decision-makers can contextualize the floristic significance of their dry forest at a regional and continental scale.</p>

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf characteristics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, control: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, control: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-sensitive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-sensitivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic properties. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

Carbon dynamics of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under drought and complete darkness
<p>Carbon (C) storage is considered a key component to plant survival under drought and shade, although the combined effects of these factors on survival remain poorly understood. We investigated how drought and shade alter the C dynamics and survival of tree seedlings, and whether drought limits the access to or usage of stored C. We experimentally applied two levels of soil humidity (well-watered versus drought, the latter induced by dry-down) and light availability (light versus complete darkness) on 1-year-old seedlings of <i>Acer pseudoplatanus</i> L. for 3 months. We quantified the survival, biomass, growth rate and non-structural carbo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>es (NSC) of seedlings at their time of death or at the end of the experiment for those that survived. We found that the soil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>ed out faster when drought was combined with light than when it was combined with complete darkness. Seedlings subjected to both drought and light showed reduced growth and reached 100% mortality earlier than any other treatment, with the highest NSC concentrations at the time of death. Seedlings exposed to both drought and complete darkness died significantly earlier than seedlings exposed to complete darkness only, but had similar NSC concentrations at time of their death, suggesting that drought accelerated the use of stored C under complete darkness. Complete darkness significantly reduced seedling growth and whole-plant NSC concentrations regardless of soil humidity, while root NSC concentrations were significantly more reduced when complete darkness was combined with drought conditions. Thus, the C dynamics in <i>A. pseudoplatanus</i> seedlings under complete darkness was not hindered by drought, i.e., the access and use of stored C was not limited by drought. The contrasting growth and C storage responses <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>ven by drought under light versus complete darkness are consistent with a key role of the drought progression in the C dynamics of trees.</p>

Highly variable chemical signatures over short spatial distances among Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) populations
<p>Understanding within-species variability in terpenoid content and composition is highly relevant for predicting species adaptive potential to biotic stresses, but there is still limited information on terpene variations even for widespread species. We studied the foliage content and composition of terpenoids, foliage structure, and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents in <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L. in four Estonian sites ranging from dry forest to raised bog. In the bogs, samples were taken along the environmental gradient from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>er margins towards wetter central parts. A chiral column was used to gain insight into the variation in terpene composition. We hypothesized that terpene contents increase and the composition becomes more diverse in more strongly N-limited sites (greater C/N ratio) and that terpene signatures cluster together in sub-sites with similar conditions (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>er/wetter). Altogether 37 terpenes were quantified across the sites. Extremely large variability of terpene contents, 48–62% for monoterpenes and 61–89% for sesquiterpenes, was observed. According to the amounts of α-pinenes and (+)-3-carene, we distinguished two different ‘pine chemotypes’. Contrary to the hypothesis, terpene contents and variability were the greatest in the dry site with the lowest C/N ratio. However, individual terpenoids correlated differently with C or N in different sites, indicating site effects on terpene composition. Moreover, correlations between the terpenoids and C or N depended on the pine chemotype. The sub-sites with different water regime were more strongly clustered together within the site than across the sites. The study demonstrates extensive variations in terpene contents and composition among the populations and over short spatial distances within the populations, suggesting a large among- and within-population adaptive capacity of <i>P. sylvestris</i>.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

ATM directs DNA damage responses and proteostasis via genetically separable pathways
<p>The protein kinase ATM is a master regulator of the DNA damage response but also responds directly to oxidative stress. Loss of ATM causes ataxia telangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder with pleiotropic symptoms that include cerebellar dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, and premature aging. We genetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated the activation of ATM by DNA damage from that by oxidative stress using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation-of-function mutations. We found that deficient activation of ATM by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and DNA double-strand breaks resulted in loss of cell viability, checkpoint activation, and DNA end resection in response to DNA damage. In contrast, loss of oxidative activation of ATM had minimal effects on DNA damage–related outcomes but blocked ATM-mediated initiation of checkpoint responses after oxidative stress and resulted in deficiencies in mitochon<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>al function and autophagy. In addition, expression of a variant ATM incapable of activation by oxidative stress resulted in widespread protein aggregation. These results indicate a direct relationship between the mechanism of ATM activation and its effects on cellular metabolism and DNA damage responses in human cells and implicate ATM in the control of protein homeostasis.</p>

Stoichiometry controls activity of phase-separated clusters of actin signaling proteins
<p>Biomolecular condensates concentrate macromolecules into foci without a surrounding membrane. Many condensates appear to form through multivalent interactions that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>ve liquid-liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation (LLPS). LLPS increases the specific activity of actin regulatory proteins toward actin assembly by the Arp2/3 complex. We show that this increase occurs because LLPS of the Nephrin–Nck–N-WASP signaling pathway on lipid bilayers increases membrane dwell time of N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex, consequently increasing actin assembly. Dwell time varies with relative stoichiometry of the signaling proteins in the phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated clusters, rendering N-WASP and Arp2/3 activity stoichiometry dependent. This mechanism of controlling protein activity is enabled by the stoichiometrically undefined nature of biomolecular condensates. Such regulation should be a general feature of signaling systems that assemble through multivalent interactions and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>ve nonequilibrium outputs.</p>

Design and control of gas diffusion process in a nanoporous soft crystal
<p>Design of the gas-diffusion process in a porous material is challenging because a contracted pore aperture is a prerequisite, whereas the channel traffic of guest molecules is regulated by the flexible and dynamic motions of nanochannels. Here, we present the rational design of a diffusion-regulatory system in a porous coordination polymer (PCP) in which flip-flop molecular motions within the framework structure provide kinetic gate functions that enable efficient gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and storage. The PCP shows substantial temperature-responsive adsorption in which the adsorbate molecules are differentiated by each gate-admission temperature, facilitating kinetics-based gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations of oxygen/argon and ethylene/ethane with high selectivities of ~350 and ~75, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the long-lasting physical encapsulation of ethylene at ambient conditions, owing to strongly impeded diffusion in distinctive nanochannels.</p>

Phase separation focuses DNA sensing
<p>The presence of any double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytosol is a potent trigger for the activation of innate immune responses. In the context of an infection, immunorecognition of “foreign” dsDNA serves as a central host strategy to detect the presence of pathogens. Under certain conditions, however, sensing of aberrant cytosolic self-dsDNA can also promote destructive inflammation in autoinflammatory diseases. A fundamental question is how cells spatially organize and biochemically regulate the recognition of intracellular dsDNA in the vast cytosolic space of a cell. On page 704 in this issue, Du and Chen (<i>1</i>) introduce an elegant explanation by demonstrating that phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of the dsDNA sensor cGAS [cyclic GMP (guanosine monophosphate)–AMP (adenosine monophosphate) synthase] enables this central task. This adds to the cellular processes that are facilitated by phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation.</p>

Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control
<p>Super-enhancers (SEs) are clusters of enhancers that cooperatively assemble a high density of the transcriptional apparatus to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>ve robust expression of genes with prominent roles in cell identity. Here we demonstrate that the SE-enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid-like condensates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb condensates. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts. These results support the idea that coactivators form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated condensates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-identity genes.</p>

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins
<p>Prion-like RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP43 and FUS are largely soluble in the nucleus but form solid pathological aggregates when mislocalized to the cytoplasm. What keeps these proteins soluble in the nucleus and promotes aggregation in the cytoplasm is still unknown. We report here that RNA critically regulates the phase behavior of prion-like RBPs. Low RNA/protein ratios promote phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and the formation of cytotoxic solid-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.</p>

Piezo2 channel–Merkel cell signaling modulates the conversion of touch to itch
<p>The somatosensory system relays many signals ranging from light touch to pain and itch. Touch is critical to spatial awareness and communication. However, in disease states, innocuous mechanical stimuli can provoke pathologic sensations such as mechanical itch (alloknesis). The molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern this conversion remain unknown. We found that in mice, alloknesis in aging and dry skin is associated with a loss of Merkel cells, the touch receptors in the skin. Targeted genetic deletion of Merkel cells and associated mechanosensitive Piezo2 channels in the skin was sufficient to produce alloknesis. Chemogenetic activation of Merkel cells protected against alloknesis in dry skin. This study reveals a previously unknown function of the cutaneous touch receptors and may provide insight into the development of alloknesis.</p>

Spatially distributed multipartite entanglement enables EPR steering of atomic clouds
<p>A key resource for distributed quantum-enhanced protocols is entanglement between spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated modes. However, the robust generation and detection of entanglement between spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated regions of an ultracold atomic system remain a challenge. We used spin mixing in a tightly confined Bose-Einstein condensate to generate an entangled state of indistinguishable particles in a single spatial mode. We show experimentally that this entanglement can be spatially distributed by self-similar expansion of the atomic cloud. We used spatially resolved spin read-out to reveal a particularly strong form of quantum correlations known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between distinct parts of the expanded cloud. Based on the strength of EPR steering, we constructed a witness, which confirmed genuine 5-partite entanglement.</p>

Chameleon-like elastomers with molecularly encoded strain-adaptive stiffening and coloration

Microphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of the architecturally distinct blocks results in physically cross-linked networks that display vibrant color, extreme softness, and intense strain stiffening on par with that of skin tissue. Each of these functional properties is regulated by the structure of one macromolecule, without the need for chemical cross-linking or additives. These materials remain stable under conditions characteristic of internal bodily environments and under ambient conditions, neither swelling in bodily fluids nor drying when exposed to air.</p>

Nanofluidic rocking Brownian motors

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The structure reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate the cavities. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T structure reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base’s interactions.</p>

Creation of a Bose-condensed gas of <sup>87</sup>Rb by laser cooling
<p>Protocols for attaining quantum degeneracy in atomic gases almost exclusively rely on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ative cooling, a time-consuming final step associated with substantial atom loss. We demonstrate direct laser cooling of a gas of rubidium-87 (<sup>87</sup>Rb) atoms to quantum degeneracy. The method is fast and induces little atom loss. The atoms are trapped in a two-dimensional optical lattice that enables cycles of compression to increase the density, followed by Raman sideband cooling to decrease the temperature. From a starting number of 2000 atoms, 1400 atoms reach quantum degeneracy in 300 milliseconds, as confirmed by a bimodal velocity distribution. The method should be broadly applicable to many bosonic and fermionic species and to systems where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ative cooling is not possible.</p>

Size effect in ion transport through angstrom-scale slits

The atomically flat angstrom-scale slits exhibit little surface charge, allowing elucidation of the role of steric effects. We find that ions with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>ed diameters larger than the slit size can still permeate through, albeit with reduced mobility. The confinement also leads to a notable asymmetry between anions and cations of the same diameter.

Toughening elastomers using mussel-inspired iron-catechol complexes
<p>Materials often exhibit a trade-off between stiffness and extensibility; for example, strengthening elastomers by increasing their cross-link density leads to embrittlement and decreased toughness. Inspired by cuticles of marine mussel byssi, we circumvent this inherent trade-off by incorporating sacrificial, reversible iron-catechol cross-links into a dry, loosely cross-linked epoxy network. The iron-containing network exhibits two to three orders of magnitude increases in stiffness, tensile strength, and tensile toughness compared to its iron-free precursor while gaining recoverable hysteretic energy dissipation and maintaining its original extensibility. Compared to previous realizations of this chemistry in hydrogels, the dry nature of the network enables larger property enhancement owing to the cooperative effects of both the increased cross-link density given by the reversible iron-catecholate complexes and the chain-restricting ionomeric nanodomains that they form.</p>

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators

Mechanism of Activation of Protein Kinase JAK2 by the Growth Hormone Receptor
<p>Signaling from JAK (Janus kinase) protein kinases to STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) transcription factors is key to many aspects of biology and medicine, yet the mechanism by which cytokine receptors initiate signaling is enigmatic. We present a complete mechanistic model for activation of receptor-bound JAK2, based on an archetypal cytokine receptor, the growth hormone receptor. For this, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor positioning of the JAK2 binding motif in the receptor dimer, substitution of the receptor extracellular domains with Jun zippers to control the position of its transmembrane (TM) helices, atomistic modeling of TM helix movements, and docking of the crystal structures of the JAK2 kinase and its inhibitory pseudokinase domain with an opposing kinase-pseudokinase domain pair. Activation of the receptor dimer induced a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of its JAK2 binding motifs, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>ven by a ligand-induced transition from a parallel TM helix pair to a left-handed crossover arrangement. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation leads to removal of the pseudokinase domain from the kinase domain of the partner JAK2 and pairing of the two kinase domains, facilitating trans-activation. This model may well generalize to other class I cytokine receptors.</p>

A Simple Method for Measuring Apoplast Hydration and Collecting Apoplast Contents
<p>The plant leaf apoplast is a dynamic environment subject to a variety of both internal and external stimuli. In addition to being a conduit for water vapor and gas exchange involved in transpiration and photosynthesis, the apoplast also accumulates many nutrients transported from the soil as well as those produced through photosynthesis. The internal leaf also provides a protective environment for endophytic and pathogenic microbes alike. Given the diverse array of physiological processes occurring in the apoplast, it is expedient to develop methods to study its contents. Many established methods rely on vacuum infiltration of an apoplast wash solution followed by centrifugation. In this study, we describe a refined method optimized for maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) seedling leaves, which not only provides a simple procedure for obtaining apoplast fluid, but also allows direct calculation of apoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>ion at the time of harvest for every sample. In addition, we describe an abbreviated method for estimating apoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>ion if the full apoplast extraction is not necessary. Finally, we show the applicability of this optimized apoplast extraction procedure for plants infected with the maize pathogen <i>Pantoea stewartii</i> ssp <i>stewartii</i>, including the efficient isolation of bacteria previously residing in the apoplast. The approaches to establishing this method should make it generally applicable to other types of plants.</p>

<p>The correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, and sister chromatids during meiosis II, relies on the tight control of the cohesion complex. The phosphorylation and subsequent cleavage of the meiotic recombination protein REC8 (REC8-like family protein [SYN1] in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]), the α-kleisin subunit of the cohesion ring, along the chromosome arms at meiosis I allows crossovers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes without chromatid dissociation. REC8 continues to localize and function at the centromeres up to metaphase II and, in yeast and vertebrates, is protected from cleavage by means of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation. Here, we show that, in plants, centromeric sister chromatid cohesion until meiosis II also requires the activity of a PP2A-type phosphatase complex. The combined absence of the regulatory subunits PP2AB′α and PP2AB′β leads to the premature loss of chromosome cohesion in meiosis I. Male meiocytes of the <i>pp2ab′αβ</i> double mutant display premature depletion of SYN1. The PP2AA1 structural and B′α regulatory subunit localize specifically to centromeres until metaphase II, supporting a role for the PP2A complex in the SYN1-mediated maintenance of centromeric cohesion in plant meiosis.</p>

Candidate Enzymes for Saffron Crocin Biosynthesis Are Localized in Multiple Cellular Compartments
<p>Saffron is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>ed stigmas of <i>Crocus sativus</i> and is the most expensive spice in the world. Its red color is due to crocins, which are apocarotenoid glycosides that accumulate in the vacuole to a level up to 10% of the stigma dry weight. Previously, we characterized the first dedicated enzyme in the crocin biosynthetic pathway, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase2 (CsCCD2), which cleaves zeaxanthin to yield crocetin dialdehyde. In this work, we identified six putative <i>aldehyde dehydrogenase</i> (<i>ALDH</i>) genes expressed in <i>C. sativus</i> stigmas. Heterologous expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> showed that only one of corresponding proteins (CsALDH3I1) was able to convert crocetin dialdehyde into the crocin precursor crocetin. CsALDH3I1 carries a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain, similar to that of the <i>Neurospora crassa</i> membrane-associated apocarotenoid dehydrogenase YLO-1. We also characterized the UDP-glycosyltransferase CsUGT74AD1, which converts crocetin to crocins 1 and 2′. In vitro assays revealed high specificity of CsALDH3I1 for crocetin dialdehyde and long-chain apocarotenals and of CsUGT74AD1 for crocetin. Following extract fractionation, CsCCD2, CsALDH3I1, and CsUGT74AD1 were found in the insoluble fraction, suggesting their association with membranes or large insoluble complexes. Analysis of protein localization in both <i>C. sativus</i> stigmas and following transgene expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves revealed that CsCCD2, CsALDH3I, and CsUGT74AD1 were localized to the plastids, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the cytoplasm, respectively, in association with cytoskeleton-like structures. Based on these findings and current literature, we propose that the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm function as transit centers for metabolites whose biosynthesis starts in the plastid and are accumulated in the vacuole.</p>

Gradients in Wall Mechanics and Polysaccharides along Growing Inflorescence Stems
<p>At early stages of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) flowering, the inflorescence stem undergoes rapid growth, with elongation occurring predominantly in the apical ∼4 cm of the stem. We measured the spatial gradients for elongation rate, osmotic pressure, cell wall thickness, and wall mechanical compliances and coupled these macroscopic measurements with molecular-level characterization of the polysaccharide composition, mobility, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>ion, and intermolecular interactions of the inflorescence cell wall using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering. Force-extension curves revealed a gradient, from high to low, in the plastic and elastic compliances of cell walls along the elongation zone, but plots of growth rate versus wall compliances were strikingly nonlinear. Neutron-scattering curves showed only subtle changes in wall structure, including a slight increase in cellulose microfibril alignment along the growing stem. In contrast, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra showed substantial decreases in pectin amount, esterification, branching, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>ion, and mobility in an apical-to-basal pattern, while the cellulose content increased modestly. These results suggest that pectin structural changes are connected with increases in pectin-cellulose interaction and reductions in wall compliances along the apical-to-basal gradient in growth rate. These pectin structural changes may lessen the ability of the cell wall to undergo stress relaxation and irreversible expansion (e.g. induced by expansins), thus contributing to the growth kinematics of the growing stem.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, dynamic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict dynamic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ative demand as well as dynamic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

Hornwort Stomata: Architecture and Fate Shared with 400-Million-Year-Old Fossil Plants without Leaves
<p>As one of the earliest plant groups to evolve stomata, hornworts are key to understanding the origin and function of stomata. Hornwort stomata are large and scattered on sporangia that grow from their bases and release spores at their tips. We present data from development and immunocytochemistry that identify a role for hornwort stomata that is correlated with sporangial and spore maturation. We measured guard cells across the genera with stomata to assess developmental changes in size and to analyze any correlation with genome size. Stomata form at the base of the sporophyte in the green region, where they develop differential wall thickenings, form a pore, and die. Guard cells collapse inwardly, increase in surface area, and remain perched over a substomatal cavity and network of intercellular spaces that is initially fluid filled. Following pore formation, the sporophyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>es from the outside inwardly and continues to do so after guard cells die and collapse. Spore tetrads develop in spore mother cell walls within a mucilaginous matrix, both of which progressively dry before sporophyte dehiscence. A lack of correlation between guard cell size and DNA content, lack of arabinans in cell walls, and perpetually open pores are consistent with the inactivity of hornwort stomata. Stomata are expendable in hornworts, as they have been lost twice in derived taxa. Guard cells and epidermal cells of hornworts show striking similarities with the earliest plant fossils. Our findings identify an architecture and fate of stomata in hornworts that is ancient and common to plants without sporophytic leaves.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The adhesion of plant cells is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between cell wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant cells are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border cells are examples of this. Border cells (in some species known as border-like cells) provide an expendable barrier between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex cellular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip cell walls. Our study included immunocarbo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydrat</span></strong>e microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of cell wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of cell wall components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified multiple novel modes of cell wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border cells. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border cell maturation and enable us to develop a model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation process. We propose that loss of adhesion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of cell curvature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dri</span></strong>ven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

Is gastrointestinal plasticity in king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) elicited by diet-fibre or diet-energy dilution?
<p>Phenotypic plasticity of organ size allows some animals to manage fluctuations of resource quality or availability. Here, we examined the phenotypic plasticity of the gastrointestinal tract of king quail (<i>Coturnix chinensis</i>) in a diet-fibre manipulation study. Quail were offered either a control low-fibre (high-quality) food (8.5% neutral-detergent fibre; NDF), or one of two experimental diets of higher fibre contents of 16% NDF (i.e. low-quality food). To examine whether phenotypic plasticity of organ size was associated with the fibre content per se, or as a consequence of diluting the diet energy contents by adding fibre, one of the high-fibre feeds was ‘balanced’ with additional energy to match that of the low-fibre control diet. Total empty dry mass of the gastrointestinal tract was significantly heavier among birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet as compared with those offered the control diet, with birds offered the fibrous but energy-balanced diet having guts of intermediate size. The heavier entire-gut mass (dry) of quail offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated mainly with these birds having significantly heavier gizzards. Notably, the larger gizzard in the birds offered the unbalanced high-fibre diet was associated with marked increases in their metabolisability (digestion) of diet fibre. Our findings suggest that the available energy in the diet may be more important for eliciting phenotypic changes in the gut of these herbivorous birds rather than simple physical effects of diet fibre on feed intakes or on muscular compensation to fibrous ingesta.</p>

Venous thromboembolism in adult elective spinal surgery
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the incidence of primary venous thromboembolism (VTE),   epidural haematoma, surgical site infection (SSI), and 90-day mortality   after elective spinal surgery, and the effect of two protocols for   prophylaxis.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 2181 adults underwent 2366 elective spinal procedures   between January 2007 and January 2012.

Comparative Genomics of the Pine Pathogens and Beetle Symbionts in the Genus <i>Grosmannia</i>
<p>Studies on beetle/tree fungal symbionts typically characterize the ecological and geographic distributions of the fungal populations. There is limited understanding of the genome-wide evolutionary processes that act within and between species as such fungi adapt to different environments, leading to physiological differences and reproductive isolation. Here, we assess genomic evidence for such evolutionary processes by extending our recent work on <i>Grosmannia clavigera</i>, which is vectored by the mountain pine beetle and jeffrey pine beetle. We report the genome sequences of an additional 11 <i>G. clavigera</i> (Gc) sensu lato strains from the two known sibling species, <i>Grosmannia</i> sp. (Gs) and Gc. The 12 fungal genomes are structurally similar, showing large-scale synteny within and between species. We identified 103,430 single-nucleotide variations that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated the <i>Grosmannia</i> strains into divergent Gs and Gc clades, and further divided each of these clades into two subclades, one of which may represent an additional species. Comparing variable genes between these lineages, we identified truncated genes and potential pseudogenes, as well as seven genes that show evidence of positive selection. As these variable genes are involved in secondary metabolism and in detoxifying or utilizing host-tree defense chemicals (e.g., polyketide synthases, oxidoreductases, and mono-oxygenases), their variants may reflect adaptation to the specific chemistries of the host trees <i>Pinus contorta</i>, <i>P. ponderosa</i>, and <i>P. jeffreyi</i>. This work provides a comprehensive resource for developing informative markers for landscape population genomics of these ecologically and economically important fungi, and an approach that could be extended to other beetle–tree-associated fungi.</p>

Ancestry of the Australian Termitivorous Numbat
<p>The Australian numbat, <i>Myrmecobius fasciatus</i>, is the only marsupial that feeds almost exclusively on termites and that has a life following the diurnally restricted and dynamic geographical distribution of termites. The millions of years of this adaptation led to unique morphological and anatomical features, especially basicranial and dental characteristics, that make it difficult to identify a clear phylogenetic affiliation to other marsupials. From DNA sequence analyses, the family Myrmecobiidae is placed within the dasyuromorph marsupials, but the exact position varies from study to study, and support values are mostly rather modest. Here, we report the recovery and analysis of approximately 110,000 quasifossilized traces of mobile element insertions into the genome of a dasyurid marsupial (Tasmanian devil), 25 of which are phylogenetically informative for early dasyuromorphial evolution. Fourteen of these ancient retroposon insertions are shared by the 16 Dasyuromorphia species analyzed, including the numbat, but are absent in the outgroups. An additional 11 other insertions are present in all Dasyuridae but are absent in the numbat. These findings place numbats as the sister group to all living Dasyuridae and show that the investigated Dasyuromorphia, including the Myrmecobiidae, constitutes a monophyletic group that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated from Peramelemorphia, Notoryctemorphia, and other marsupials.</p>

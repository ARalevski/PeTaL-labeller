The changing face of fractures of the hip in Northern Ireland
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We reviewed all patients who sustained a fracture of the hip   and were treated in Northern Ireland over a period of 15 years to   identify trends in incidence, the demographics of the patients,   the rates of mortality, the configuration of the fracture and the   choice of implant.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Since 01 January 2001 data about every fracture of the hip sustained   in an adult have been collected centrally in Northern Ireland. All   adults with such a fracture between 2000 and 2015 were included   in the study. Temporal changes in their demographics, the mode of   treatment, and outcomes including mortality were analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The incidence of fractures of the hip, in Northern Ireland, rose   from 54 in 100 000 in 2000 to 86 in 100 000 in 2015. If these trends   continue, we predict this rising to 128 in 100 000 in 2030. We found   that these patients are becoming older and increasingly frail, as   assessed by the American Association of Anesthesiology grade. Complex extracapsular   fractures have become more common since 2009, which may explain   the increased use of cephalomedullary nails. Despite increasing   frailty, the 30-day and 12-month rates of mortality fell significantly   (p = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures of the hip are becoming more common and more complex   in an aging, increasingly frail population. We expect these trends   to continue. This will place an increasing economic and clinical   strain on healthcare systems. Forward planning is essential to put   systems in place that can deal with the increasing demand.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1223â€“31.</p></sec>

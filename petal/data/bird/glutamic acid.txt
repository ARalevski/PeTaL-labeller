NMDA-Type Glutamate Receptor Activation Promotes Vascular Remodeling and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Excessive proliferation and apoptosis resistance in pulmonary vascular cells underlie vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Specific treatments for PAH exist, mostly targeting endothelial dysfunction, but high pulmonary arterial pressure still causes heart failure and death. Pulmonary vascular remodeling may be driven by metabolic reprogramming of vascular cells to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>inolysis and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate production. The <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), a major neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor, is also expressed on vascular cells, but its role in PAH is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We assessed the status of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate-NMDAR axis in the pulmonary arteries of patients with PAH and controls through mass spectrometry imaging, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. We measured the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate release from cultured pulmonary vascular cells using enzymatic assays and analyzed NMDAR regulation/phosphorylation through Western blot experiments. The effect of NMDAR blockade on human pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation was determined using a BrdU incorporation assay. We assessed the role of NMDARs in vascular remodeling associated to pulmonary hypertension, in both smooth muscle-specific NMDAR knockout mice exposed to chronic hypoxia and the monocrotaline rat model of pulmonary hypertension using NMDAR blockers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We report <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate accumulation, upregulation of the NMDAR, and NMDAR engagement reflected by increases in GluN1-subunit phosphorylation in the pulmonary arteries of human patients with PAH.

Smooth-muscle NMDAR deficiency in mice attenuated the vascular remodeling triggered by chronic hypoxia, highlighting the role of vascular NMDARs in pulmonary hypertension.

Essential roles of AMPA receptor GluA1 phosphorylation and presynaptic HCN channels in fast-acting antidepressant responses of ketamine
<p>Although the molecular mechanism is not clear, the clinically tested drug ketamine has rapid antidepressant action that does not require the multiple weeks of treatment needed for other antidepressant drugs to have an effect. We showed that ketamine potentiated Schaffer collateral–CA1 cell excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slice preparations from rodents and enhanced the phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit on Ser<sup>845</sup> of the AMPA-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor in the hippocampal area CA1. These effects persisted when γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors were pharmacologically blocked. Ketamine reduced behavioral despair in wild-type mice but had no effect in GluA1 S845A knock-in mutant mice. Presynaptic (CA3 pyramidal cell), but not postsynaptic (CA1 pyramidal cell), deletion of <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA)–type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptors eliminated the ketamine-induced enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices and the antidepressant actions of ketamine in mice. The synaptic and behavioral actions of ketamine were completely occluded by inhibition or deletion of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide–gated channel 1 (HCN1). Our results implicate presynaptic NMDA receptor inhibition followed by reduced activity of presynaptic HCN1 channels, which would result in an increase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate release and postsynaptic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor activity, as a mechanism of ketamine action. These data provide a mechanism for changes in synaptic activity that could explain the fast-acting antidepressant effects of this drug.</p>

Glutamate triggers long-distance, calcium-based plant defense signaling
<p>Animals require rapid, long-range molecular signaling networks to integrate sensing and response throughout their bodies. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system, facilitating long-range information exchange via activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor channels. Similarly, plants sense local signals, such as herbivore attack, and transmit this information throughout the plant body to rapidly activate defense responses in undamaged parts. Here we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate is a wound signal in plants. Ion channels of the <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ATE RECEPTOR–LIKE</i> family act as sensors that convert this signal into an increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration that propagates to distant organs, where defense responses are then induced.</p>

Glutamate signaling at cytoneme synapses
<p>We investigated the roles of components of neuronal synapses for development of the <i>Drosophila</i> air sac primordium (ASP). The ASP, an epithelial tube, extends specialized signaling filopodia called cytonemes that take up signals such as Dpp (Decapentaplegic, a homolog of the vertebrate bone morphogenetic protein) from the wing imaginal disc. Dpp signaling in the ASP was compromised if disc cells lacked Synaptobrevin and Synaptotagmin-1 (which function in vesicle transport at neuronal synapses), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate transporter, and a voltage-gated calcium channel, or if ASP cells lacked Synaptotagmin-4 or the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor GluRII. Transient elevations of intracellular calcium in ASP cytonemes correlate with signaling activity. Calcium transients in ASP cells depend on GluRII, are activated by <sc>l</sc>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate and by stimulation of an optogenetic ion channel expressed in the wing disc, and are inhibited by EGTA and by the GluR inhibitor NASPM (1-naphthylacetyl spermine trihydrochloride).

NRT1.1-Related NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Toxicity Is Associated with a Disturbed Balance between NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Uptake and Assimilation
<p>A high concentration of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) as the sole source of nitrogen in the growth medium often is toxic to plants. The nitrate transporter NRT1.1 is involved in mediating the effects of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity; however, the mechanism remains undefined. In this study, wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Columbia-0 [Col-0]) and <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants (<i>chl1-1</i> and <i>chl1-5</i>) were grown hydroponically in NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> media to assess the function of NRT1.1 in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress responses. All the plants grew normally in medium containing mixed nitrogen sources, but Col-0 displayed more chlorosis and lower biomass and photosynthesis than the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants in (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium. Grafting experiments between Col-0 and <i>chl1-5</i> further confirmed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity is influenced by NRT1.1. In (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium, NRT1.1 induced the expression of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> transporters, increasing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake. Additionally, the activities of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ine synthetase and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate synthetase in roots of Col-0 plants decreased and soluble sugar accumulated significantly, whereas pyruvate kinase-mediated glycolysis was not affected, all of which contributed to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation. By contrast, the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants showed reduced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ine synthetase, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate synthetase, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate dehydrogenase. Moreover, the up-regulation of genes involved in ethylene synthesis and senescence in Col-0 plants treated with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> suggests that ethylene is involved in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity responses. This study showed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity is related to a nitrate-independent signaling function of <i>NRT1.1</i> in Arabidopsis, characterized by enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> accumulation and altered NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> metabolism, which stimulates ethylene synthesis, leading to plant senescence.</p>

Functional changes of AMPA responses in human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neural progenitors in fragile X syndrome
<p>Altered neuronal network formation and function involving dysregulated excitatory and inhibitory circuits are associated with fragile X syndrome (FXS). We examined functional maturation of the excitatory transmission system in FXS by investigating the response of FXS patient–derived neural progenitor cells to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate analog (AMPA). Neural progenitors derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines generated from boys with FXS had augmented intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to AMPA and kainate that were mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) lacking the GluA2 subunit. Together with the enhanced differentiation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate-responsive cells, the proportion of CP-AMPAR and <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor–coexpressing cells was increased in human FXS progenitors. Differentiation of cells lacking GluA2 was also increased and paralleled the increased inward rectification in neural progenitors derived from <i>Fmr1</i>-knockout mice (the FXS mouse model). Human FXS progenitors had increased the expression of the precursor and mature forms of miR-181a, a microRNA that represses translation of the transcript encoding GluA2. Blocking GluA2-lacking, CP-AMPARs reduced the neurite length of human iPSC-derived control progenitors and further reduced the shortened length of neurites in human FXS progenitors, supporting the contribution of CP-AMPARs to the regulation of progenitor differentiation. Furthermore, we observed reduced expression of <i>Gria2</i> (the GluA2-encoding gene) in the frontal lobe of FXS mice, consistent with functional changes of AMPARs in FXS. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through CP-AMPARs may increase the vulnerability and affect the differentiation and migration of distinct cell populations, which may interfere with normal circuit formation in FXS.</p>

Bacterial pseudokinase catalyzes protein polyglutamylation to inhibit the SidE-family ubiquitin ligases

Homer1a drives homeostatic scaling-down of excitatory synapses during sleep
<p>Sleep is an essential process that supports learning and memory by acting on synapses through poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Using biochemistry, proteomics, and imaging in mice, we find that during sleep, synapses undergo widespread alterations in composition and signaling, including weakening of synapses through removal and dephosphorylation of synaptic AMPA-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptors. These changes are driven by the immediate early gene Homer1a and signaling from group I metabotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptors mGluR1/5. Homer1a serves as a molecular integrator of arousal and sleep need via the wake- and sleep-promoting neuromodulators, noradrenaline and adenosine, respectively. Our data suggest that homeostatic scaling-down, a global form of synaptic plasticity, is active during sleep to remodel synapses and participates in the consolidation of contextual memory.</p>

A nuclease that mediates cell death induced by DNA damage and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1
<p>Inhibition or genetic deletion of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is protective against toxic insults in many organ systems. The molecular mechanisms underlying PARP-1–dependent cell death involve release of mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and its translocation to the nucleus, which results in chromatinolysis. We identified macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as a PARP-1–dependent AIF-associated nuclease (PAAN). AIF was required for recruitment of MIF to the nucleus, where MIF cleaves genomic DNA into large fragments. Depletion of MIF, disruption of the AIF-MIF interaction, or mutation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ic acid at position 22 in the catalytic nuclease domain blocked MIF nuclease activity and inhibited chromatinolysis, cell death induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate excitotoxicity, and focal stroke. Inhibition of MIF’s nuclease activity is a potential therapeutic target for diseases caused by excessive PARP-1 activation.</p>

Analysis of Posttranslational Activation of Alternative Oxidase Isoforms
<p>Mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) in plants is a non-proton-motive ubiquinol oxidase that is activated by redox mechanisms and 2-oxo acids. A comparative analysis of the AOX isoenzymes AOX1A, AOX1C, and AOX1D from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) revealed that cysteine residues, CysI and CysII, are both involved in 2-oxo acid activation, with AOX1A activity being more increased by 2-oxo acids than that of AOX1C and AOX1D. Substitution of cysteine in AOX1A by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate mimicked its activation by pyruvate or glyoxylate, but not in AOX1C and AOX1D. CysIII, only present in AOX1A, is not involved in activation by reduction or metabolites, but substitutions at this position affected activity. AOX1A carrying a serine residue at position CysI was activated by succinate, while correspondingly substituted variants of AOX1C and AOX1D were insensitive. Activation by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate at CysI and CysII is consistent with the formation of the thiohemiacetal, while succinate activation after changing CysI to serine suggests hemiacetal formation. Surprisingly, in AOX1A, replacement of CysI by alanine, which cannot form a (thio)hemiacetal, led to even higher activities, pointing to an alternative mechanism of activation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AOX isoforms are differentially activated and that activation at CysI and CysII is additive.</p>

Dissecting the Metabolic Role of Mitochondria during Developmental Leaf Senescence
<p>The functions of mitochondria during leaf senescence, a type of programmed cell death aimed at the massive retrieval of nutrients from the senescing organ to the rest of the plant, remain elusive. Here, combining experimental and analytical approaches, we showed that mitochondrial integrity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is conserved until the latest stages of leaf senescence, while their number drops by 30%. Adenylate phosphorylation state assays and mitochondrial respiratory measurements indicated that the leaf energy status also is maintained during this time period. Furthermore, after establishing a curated list of genes coding for products targeted to mitochondria, we analyzed in isolation their transcript profiles, focusing on several key mitochondrial functions, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial electron transfer chain, iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, transporters, as well as catabolic pathways. In tandem with a metabolomic approach, our data indicated that mitochondrial metabolism was reorganized to support the selective catabolism of both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong>s and fatty acids. Such adjustments would ensure the replenishment of α-ketoglutarate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate, which provide the carbon backbones for nitrogen remobilization. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate, being the substrate of the strongly up-regulated cytosolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ine synthase, is likely to become a metabolically limiting factor in the latest stages of developmental leaf senescence. Finally, an evolutionary age analysis revealed that, while branched-chain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong> and proline catabolism are very old mitochondrial functions particularly enriched at the latest stages of leaf senescence, auxin metabolism appears to be rather newly acquired. In summation, our work shows that, during developmental leaf senescence, mitochondria orchestrate catabolic processes by becoming increasingly central energy and metabolic hubs.</p>

Skeletal muscle fuel selection occurs at the mitochondrial level
<p>Mammals exponentially increase the rate of carbohydrate oxidation as exercise intensity rises, while birds combust lipid almost exclusively while flying at high percentages of aerobic capacity. The fuel oxidized by contracting muscle depends on many factors: whole-body fuel storage mass, mobilization, blood transport, cellular uptake, and substrate selection at the level of the mitochondrion. We examined the fuel preferences of mitochondria isolated from mammalian and avian locomotory muscles using two approaches. First, the influence of substrates on the kinetics of respiration (<i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> and <i>V</i><sub>max</sub>) was evaluated. For all substrates and combinations, <i>K</i><sub>m,ADP</sub> was generally twofold higher in avian mitochondria. Second, fuel competition between pyruvate, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate and/or palmitoyl-<sc>l</sc>-carnitine at three levels of ATP free energy was determined using the principle of mass balance and the measured rates of O<sub>2</sub> consumption and metabolite accumulation/utilization. Avian mitochondria strongly spared pyruvate from oxidation when another substrate was available and fatty acid was the dominant substrate, regardless of energy state. Mammalian mitochondria exhibited some preference for fatty acid over pyruvate at lower flux (higher energy state), but exhibited a much greater tendency to select pyruvate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate when available. Studies in sonicated mitochondria revealed twofold higher electron transport chain electron conductance in avian mitochondria. We conclude that substantial fuel selection occurs at the level of the mitochondrial matrix and that avian flight muscle mitochondria are particularly biased toward the selection of fatty acid, possibly by facilitating high β-oxidation flux by maintaining a more oxidized matrix.</p>

Sexually different physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> to nitrogen and phosphorus deficiencies
<p>Previous studies have shown that there are significant sexual differences in the morphological and physiological responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder under stressful conditions. However, little is known about sex-specific differences in responses to nutrient deficiencies. In this study, the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deficiencies on the morphological, physiological and chloroplast ultrastructural traits of <i>P. cathayana</i> males and females were investigated. The results showed that N and P deficiencies significantly decreased plant growth, foliar N and P contents, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, and instantaneous photosynthetic N- and P-use efficiencies (PNUE and PPUE) in both sexes. Males had higher photosynthesis, higher PNUE and PPUE rates, and a lower accumulation of plastoglobules in chloroplasts than did females when exposed to N- and P-deficiency conditions. Nitrogen-deficient males had higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate dehydrogenase and peroxidase activities, and a more intact chloroplast ultrastructure, but less starch accumulation than did N-deficient females. Phosphorus-deficient males had higher nitrate reductase, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ine synthetase and acid phosphatase activities, but a lower foliar N : P ratio and less PSII damage than did P-deficient females. These results suggest that N and P deficiencies cause greater negative effects on females than on males, and that the different sexes of <i>P. cathayana</i> may employ different strategies to cope with N and P deficiencies.</p>

The pseudokinase domains of guanylyl cyclase–A and –B allosterically increase the affinity of their catalytic domains for substrate
<p>Natriuretic peptides regulate multiple physiologic systems by activating transmembrane receptors containing intracellular guanylyl cyclase domains, such as GC-A and GC-B, also known as Npr1 and Npr2, respectively. Both enzymes contain an intracellular, phosphorylated pseudokinase domain (PKD) critical for activation of the C-terminal cGMP-synthesizing guanylyl cyclase domain. Because ATP allosterically activates GC-A and GC-B, we investigated how ATP binding to the PKD influenced guanylyl cyclase activity. Molecular modeling indicated that all the residues of the ATP-binding site of the prototypical kinase PKA, except the catalytic aspartate, are conserved in the PKDs of GC-A and GC-B. Kinase-inactivating alanine substitutions for the invariant lysine in subdomain II or the aspartate in the DYG-loop of GC-A and GC-B failed to decrease enzyme phosphate content, consistent with the PKDs lacking kinase activity. In contrast, both mutations reduced enzyme activation by blocking the ability of ATP to decrease the Michaelis constant without affecting peptide-dependent activation. The analogous lysine-to-alanine substitution in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate-substituted phosphomimetic mutant form of GC-B also reduced enzyme activity, consistent with ATP stimulating guanylyl cyclase activity through an allosteric, phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Mutations designed to rigidify the conserved regulatory or catalytic spines within the PKDs increased guanylyl cyclase activity, increased sensitivity to natriuretic peptide, or reduced the Michaelis constant in the absence of ATP, consistent with ATP binding stabilizing the PKD in a conformation analogous to that of catalytically active kinases. We conclude that allosteric mechanisms evolutionarily conserved in the PKDs promote the catalytic activation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases.</p>

Hippocampal mGluR1-dependent long-term potentiation requires NAADP-mediated acidic store Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling
<p>Acidic organelles, such as endosomes and lysosomes, store Ca<sup>2+</sup> that is released in response to intracellular increases in the second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). In neurons, NAADP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling contribute to synaptic plasticity, a process of activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) [or, alternatively, long-term depression (LTD)] of synaptic strength and neuronal transmission that is critical for neuronal function and memory formation. We explored the function of and mechanisms regulating acidic Ca<sup>2+</sup> store signaling in murine hippocampal neurons. We found that metabotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor 1 (mGluR1) was coupled to NAADP signaling that elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from acidic stores. In turn, this released Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated mGluR1-dependent LTP by transiently inhibiting SK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels, possibly through the activation of protein phosphatase 2A. Genetically removing two-pore channels (TPCs), which are endolysosomal-specific ion channels, switched the polarity of plasticity from LTP to LTD, indicating the importance of specific receptor store coupling and providing mechanistic insight into how mGluR1 can produce both synaptic potentiation and synaptic depression.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the diffusion of metabotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average diffusion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis, we found that the diffusion of receptor molecules was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average diffusion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the chemical properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

The kinases HipA and HipA7 phosphorylate different substrate pools in <i>Escherichia coli</i> to promote multidrug tolerance
<p>The bacterial serine-threonine protein kinase HipA promotes multidrug tolerance by phosphorylating the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate-tRNA ligase (GltX), leading to a halt in translation, inhibition of growth, and induction of a physiologically dormant state (persistence). The HipA variant HipA7 substantially increases persistence despite being less efficient at inhibiting cell growth. We postulated that this phenotypic difference was caused by differences in the substrates targeted by both kinases. We overproduced HipA and HipA7 in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and identified their endogenous substrates by SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomics. We confirmed that GltX was the main substrate of both kinase variants and likely the primary determinant of persistence. When HipA and HipA7 were moderately overproduced from plasmids, HipA7 targeted only GltX, but HipA phosphorylated several additional substrates involved in translation, transcription, and replication, such as ribosomal protein L11 (RplK) and the negative modulator of replication initiation, SeqA. HipA7 showed reduced kinase activity compared to HipA and targeted a substrate pool similar to that of HipA only when produced from a high–copy number plasmid. The kinase variants also differed in autophosphorylation, which was substantially reduced for HipA7. When produced endogenously from the chromosome, HipA showed no activity because of inhibition by the antitoxin HipB, whereas HipA7 phosphorylated GltX and phage shock protein PspA. Initial testing did not reveal a connection between HipA-induced phosphorylation of RplK and persistence or growth inhibition, suggesting that other HipA-specific substrates were likely responsible for growth inhibition. Our results contribute to the understanding of HipA7 action and present a resource for elucidating HipA-related persistence.</p>

We found that the treatment of 12-month-old symptomatic heterozygous and homozygous <i>zQ175</i> huntingtin knockin mice for 12 weeks with CTEP, a negative allosteric modulator of metabotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor 5 (mGluR5), reduced the size and number of huntingtin aggregates, attenuated caspase-3 activity, and reduced both neuronal apoptosis and neuronal loss in brain tissue. Both motor and cognitive impairments were improved in CTEP-treated <i>zQ175</i> mice. The reduction in huntingtin protein aggregate burden by CTEP correlated with the activation of an autophagy pathway mediated by the kinase GSK3β, the transcription factor ZBTB16, and the autophagy factor ATG14. Inhibition of mGluR5 with CTEP also reduced the inhibitory phosphorylation of the autophagosome biogenesis–related kinase ULK1, increased the phosphorylation of the autophagy factor ATG13, and increased the abundance of the autophagy-related protein Beclin1 in homozygous <i>zQ175</i> mice. The findings suggest that mGluR5 antagonism may activate autophagy through convergent mechanisms to promote the clearance of mutant huntingtin aggregates and might be therapeutic in HD patients.</p>

The receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 promotes glutamine metabolism in tumors by activating the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ
<p>Malignant tumors reprogram cellular metabolism to support cancer cell proliferation and survival. Although most cancers depend on a high rate of aerobic glycolysis, many cancer cells also display addiction to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ine. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ine transporters and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>inase activity are critical for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ine metabolism in tumor cells. We found that the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 activated the TEAD family transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ), likely in a ligand-independent manner, to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ine metabolism in cells and mouse models of HER2-positive breast cancer. Overexpression of EphA2 induced the nuclear accumulation of YAP and TAZ and increased the expression of YAP/TAZ target genes. Inhibition of the GTPase Rho or the kinase ROCK abolished EphA2-dependent YAP/TAZ nuclear localization. Silencing <i>YAP</i> or <i>TAZ</i> substantially reduced the amount of intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate through decreased expression of <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i>, respectively, genes that encode proteins that promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ine uptake and metabolism. The regulatory DNA elements of both <i>SLC1A5</i> and <i>GLS</i> contain TEAD binding sites and were bound by TEAD4 in an EphA2-dependent manner. In patient breast cancer tissues, <i>EphA2</i> expression positively correlated with that of <i>YAP</i> and <i>TAZ</i>, as well as that of <i>GLS</i> and <i>SLC1A5</i>. Although high expression of <i>EphA2</i> predicted enhanced metastatic potential and poor patient survival, it also rendered HER2-positive breast cancer cells more sensitive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>inase inhibition. The findings define a previously unknown mechanism of EphA2-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>inolysis through YAP/TAZ activation in HER2-positive breast cancer and identify potential therapeutic targets in patients.</p>

Reducing eIF4E-eIF4G interactions restores the balance between protein synthesis and actin dynamics in fragile X syndrome model mice
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. FXS is caused by silencing of the <i>FMR1</i> gene, which encodes fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an mRNA-binding protein that represses the translation of its target mRNAs. One mechanism by which FMRP represses translation is through its association with cytoplasmic FMRP-interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1), which subsequently sequesters and inhibits eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). CYFIP1 shuttles between the FMRP-eIF4E complex and the Rac1–Wave regulatory complex, thereby connecting translational regulation to actin dynamics and dendritic spine morphology, which are dysregulated in FXS model mice that lack FMRP. Treating FXS mice with 4EGI-1, which blocks interactions between eIF4E and eIF4G, a critical interaction partner for translational initiation, reversed defects in hippocampus-dependent memory and spine morphology. We also found that 4EGI-1 normalized the phenotypes of enhanced metabotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor (mGluR)–mediated long-term depression (LTD), enhanced Rac1–p21-activated kinase (PAK)–cofilin signaling, altered actin dynamics, and dysregulated CYFIP1/eIF4E and CYFIP1/Rac1 interactions in FXS mice. Our findings are consistent with the idea that an imbalance in protein synthesis and actin dynamics contributes to pathophysiology in FXS mice, and suggest that targeting eIF4E may be a strategy for treating FXS.</p>

Adult-born hippocampal neurons bidirectionally modulate entorhinal inputs into the dentate gyrus
<p>Young adult-born granule cells (abGCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) have a profound impact on cognition and mood. However, it remains unclear how abGCs distinctively contribute to local DG information processing. We found that the actions of abGCs in the DG depend on the origin of incoming afferents. In response to lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) inputs, abGCs exert monosynaptic inhibition of mature granule cells (mGCs) through group II metabotropic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptors. By contrast, in response to medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) inputs, abGCs directly excite mGCs through <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptors. Thus, a critical function of abGCs may be to regulate the relative synaptic strengths of LEC-driven contextual information versus MEC-driven spatial information to shape distinct neural representations in the DG.</p>

Architecture of the heteromeric GluA1/2 AMPA receptor in complex with the auxiliary subunit TARP γ8
<p>AMPA-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptors (AMPARs) mediate excitatory neurotransmission and are central regulators of synaptic plasticity, a molecular mechanism underlying learning and memory. Although AMPARs act predominantly as heteromers, structural studies have focused on homomeric assemblies. Here, we present a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the heteromeric GluA1/2 receptor associated with two transmembrane AMPAR regulatory protein (TARP) γ8 auxiliary subunits, the principal AMPAR complex at hippocampal synapses. Within the receptor, the core subunits arrange to give the GluA2 subunit dominant control of gating. This structure reveals the geometry of the Q/R site that controls calcium flux, suggests association of TARP-stabilized lipids, and demonstrates that the extracellular loop of γ8 modulates gating by selectively interacting with the GluA2 ligand-binding domain. Collectively, this structure provides a blueprint for deciphering the signal transduction mechanisms of synaptic AMPARs.</p>

Architecture and subunit arrangement of native AMPA receptors elucidated by cryo-EM
<p>Glutamate-gated AMPA receptors mediate the fast component of excitatory signal transduction at chemical synapses throughout all regions of the mammalian brain. AMPA receptors are tetrameric assemblies composed of four subunits, GluA1–GluA4. Despite decades of study, the subunit composition, subunit arrangement, and molecular structure of native AMPA receptors remain unknown. Here we elucidate the structures of 10 distinct native AMPA receptor complexes by single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We find that receptor subunits are arranged nonstochastically, with the GluA2 subunit preferentially occupying the B and D positions of the tetramer and with triheteromeric assemblies comprising a major population of native AMPA receptors. Cryo-EM maps define the structure for S2-M4 linkers between the ligand-binding and transmembrane domains, suggesting how neurotransmitter binding is coupled to ion channel gating.</p>

A gut-brain neural circuit for nutrient sensory transduction
<p>The brain is thought to sense gut stimuli only via the passive release of hormones. This is because no connection has been described between the vagus and the putative gut epithelial sensor cell—the enteroendocrine cell. However, these electrically excitable cells contain several features of epithelial transducers. Using a mouse model, we found that enteroendocrine cells synapse with vagal neurons to transduce gut luminal signals in milliseconds by using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate as a neurotransmitter. These synaptically connected enteroendocrine cells are referred to henceforth as neuropod cells. The neuroepithelial circuit they form connects the intestinal lumen to the brainstem in one synapse, opening a physical conduit for the brain to sense gut stimuli with the temporal precision and topographical resolution of a synapse.</p>

A gut feeling
<p>The anatomist Friedrich S. Merkel predicted in 1880 that sensory systems are composed of epithelial cells and sensory nerves, which together transform environmental cues into neural signals that trigger our rich sensory experiences (<i>1</i>). We now know that this hypothesis mostly holds true for the canonical senses of vision, hearing, taste, and touch. Perhaps surprisingly, the peripheral outposts of these classical sensory systems (eyes, ears, tongue, and skin) are dwarfed by the human body's largest sensory organ—the gut. Enteroendocrine cells, which are rare epithelial cells that decorate the gut lining, have long been suspected to be sensory receptor cells that inform the brain about ingested nutrients (<i>2</i>). Since their description, these cells were assumed to play a role in metabolism and gut physiology by releasing slow-acting peptide hormones that stimulate neurons throughout the gut and in the brain. On page 1219 of this issue, Kaelberer <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) challenge this view by demonstrating that gut enteroendocrine cells locally excite sensory nerves through release of the neurotransmitter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate. A recent study of enterochromaffin cells, a subset of enteroendocrine cells, also found that gut signals are transmitted at epithelial-neural synapses through release of the neurotransmitter serotonin (<i>4</i>). Together, these findings overturn a decades-old dogma that enteroendocrine cells signal exclusively through hormones.</p>

Semisynthetic sensor proteins enable metabolic assays at the point of care
<p>Monitoring metabolites at the point of care could improve the diagnosis and management of numerous diseases. Yet for most metabolites, such assays are not available. We introduce semisynthetic, light-emitting sensor proteins for use in paper-based metabolic assays. The metabolite is oxidized by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, and the sensor changes color in the presence of the reduced cofactor, enabling metabolite quantification with the use of a digital camera. The approach makes any metabolite that can be oxidized by the cofactor a candidate for quantitative point-of-care assays, as shown for phenylalanine, glucose, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate. Phenylalanine blood levels of phenylketonuria patients were analyzed at the point of care within minutes with only 0.5 microliters of blood.

CORNICHON sorting and regulation of GLR channels underlie pollen tube Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis
<p>Compared to animals, evolution of plant calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) physiology has led to a loss of proteins for influx and small ligand–operated control of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, leaving many Ca<sup>2+</sup> mechanisms unaccounted for. Here, we show a mechanism for sorting and activation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate receptor–like channels (GLRs) by CORNICHON HOMOLOG (CNIH) proteins. Single mutants of pollen-expressed <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> GLRs (<i>At</i>GLRs) showed growth and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux phenotypes expected for plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. However, higher-order mutants of <i>At</i>GLR3.3 revealed phenotypes contradicting this assumption. These discrepancies could be explained by subcellular <i>At</i>GLR localization, and we explored the implication of <i>At</i>CNIHs in this sorting. We found that <i>At</i>GLRs interact with <i>At</i>CNIH pairs, yielding specific intracellular localizations. <i>At</i>CNIHs further trigger <i>At</i>GLR activity in mammalian cells without any ligand. These results reveal a regulatory mechanism underlying Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis by sorting and activation of <i>At</i>GLRs by <i>At</i>CNIHs.</p>

Whispering neurons fuel cortical highways
<p>The mammalian neocortex is one of the most intricate entities found in nature, both in terms of structure and function. It is the brain region responsible for the execution of high-order functions, including sensory perception, motor control, cognition, and speech. Its development is equally complex because it requires that millions to billions (depending on the species) of neurons assemble in distinct layers and connect with exquisite precision to perform complicated information processing operations. During embryonic development, formation of the cerebral cortex involves the migration of excitatory neurons generated in the ventricular zone toward the cortical plate, where they establish their final position in six well-defined horizontal layers consisting of different types of neurons and architecture. Along this migratory phase, developing neurons undergo a morphological transition from multipolar shape to bipolar morphology. Bipolar neurons exhibit faster locomotion, quickly reaching their final destination. On page 313 of this issue, Ohtaka-Maruyama <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal that this important switch to bipolar neurons is influenced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate release from neurons located at the subplate, just beneath the cortical plate. Subplate neurons trigger this transformation by making transient synaptic contacts with multipolar neurons in transit to the cortical laminae. Understanding this process is important because disruption of neocortical migration results in several human neuro-developmental diseases.</p>

CRMP2-binding compound, edonerpic maleate, accelerates motor function recovery from brain damage

Edonerpic bound to collapsin-response-mediator-protein 2 (CRMP2) and failed to augment recovery in CRMP2-deficient mice. Edonerpic maleate enhanced motor function recovery from internal capsule hemorrhage in nonhuman primates. Thus, edonerpic maleate, a neural plasticity enhancer, could be a clinically potent small compound with which to accelerate rehabilitation after brain damage.</p>

An interferon-independent lncRNA promotes viral replication by modulating cellular metabolism
<p>Viruses regulate host metabolic networks to improve their survival. The molecules that are responsive to viral infection and regulate such metabolic changes are hardly known, but are essential for understanding viral infection. Here we identify a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is induced by multiple viruses, but not by type I interferon (IFN-I), and facilitates viral replication in mouse and human cells. In vivo deficiency of lncRNA-ACOD1 (a lncRNA identified by its nearest coding gene <i>Acod1</i>, aconitate decarboxylase 1) significantly attenuates viral infection through IFN-I–IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3)–independent pathways. Cytoplasmic lncRNA-ACOD1 directly binds the metabolic enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT2) near the substrate niche, enhancing its catalytic activity. Recombinant GOT2 protein and its metabolites could rescue viral replication upon lncRNA-ACOD1 deficiency and increase lethality. This work reveals a feedback mechanism of virus-induced lncRNA-mediated metabolic promotion of viral infection and a potential target for developing broad-acting antiviral therapeutics.</p>

Metabolic recycling of ammonia via glutamate dehydrogenase supports breast cancer biomass
<p>Ammonia is a ubiquitous by-product of cellular metabolism; however, the biological consequences of ammonia production are not fully understood, especially in cancer. We found that ammonia is not merely a toxic waste product but is recycled into central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong> metabolism to maximize nitrogen utilization. In our experiments, human breast cancer cells primarily assimilated ammonia through reductive amination catalyzed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate dehydrogenase (GDH); secondary reactions enabled other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong>s, such as proline and aspartate, to directly acquire this nitrogen. Metabolic recycling of ammonia accelerated proliferation of breast cancer. In mice, ammonia accumulated in the tumor microenvironment and was used directly to generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong>s through GDH activity. These data show that ammonia is not only a secreted waste product but also a fundamental nitrogen source that can support tumor biomass.</p>

Rapid binge-like eating and body weight gain driven by zona incerta GABA neuron activation
<p>The neuronal substrate for binge eating, which can at times lead to obesity, is not clear. We find that optogenetic stimulation of mouse zona incerta (ZI) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons or their axonal projections to paraventricular thalamus (PVT) excitatory neurons immediately (in 2 to 3 seconds) evoked binge-like eating. Minimal intermittent stimulation led to body weight gain; ZI GABA neuron ablation reduced weight. ZI stimulation generated 35% of normal 24-hour food intake in just 10 minutes. The ZI cells were excited by food deprivation and the gut hunger signal ghrelin. In contrast, stimulation of excitatory axons from the parasubthalamic nucleus to PVT or direct stimulation of PVT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate neurons reduced food intake. These data suggest an unexpected robust orexigenic potential for the ZI GABA neurons.</p>

Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carriers Prevent Cadmium Toxicity by Sustaining the TCA Cycle and Glutathione Synthesis
<p>Cadmium (Cd) is a major heavy metal pollutant, and Cd toxicity is a serious cause of abiotic stress in the environment. Plants protect themselves against Cd stress through a variety of pathways. In a recent study, we found that mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (MPCs) are involved in Cd tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Following the identification of MPCs in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) in 2012, most studies have focused on the function of MPCs in animals, as a possible approach to reduce the risk of cancer developing. The results of this study show that AtMPC protein complexes are required for Cd tolerance and prevention of Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis. AtMPC complexes are composed of two elements, AtMPC1 and AtMPC2 (AtNRGA1 or AtMPC3). When the formation of AtMPCs was interrupted by the loss of <i>AtMPC1</i>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate could supplement the synthesis of acetyl-coenzyme A and sustain the TCA cycle. With the up-regulation of glutathione synthesis following exposure to Cd stress, the supplementary pathway could not efficiently drive the tricarboxylic acid cycle without AtMPC. The ATP content decreased concomitantly with the deletion of tricarboxylic acid activity, which led to Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis. More importantly, ScMPCs were also required for Cd tolerance in yeast. Our results suggest that the mechanism of Cd tolerance may be similar in other species.</p>

Protein Carbonylation and Glycation in Legume Nodules
<p>Nitrogen fixation is an agronomically and environmentally important process catalyzed by bacterial nitrogenase within legume root nodules. These unique symbiotic organs have high metabolic rates and produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species that may modify proteins irreversibly. Here, we examined two types of oxidative posttranslational modifications of nodule proteins: carbonylation, which occurs by direct oxidation of certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong>s or by interaction with reactive aldehydes arising from cell membrane lipid peroxides; and glycation, which results from the reaction of lysine and arginine residues with reducing sugars or their autooxidation products. We used a strategy based on the enrichment of carbonylated peptides by affinity chromatography followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify 369 oxidized proteins in bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) nodules. Of these, 238 corresponded to plant proteins and 131 to bacterial proteins. Lipid peroxidation products induced most carbonylation sites. This study also revealed that carbonylation has major effects on two key nodule proteins. Metal-catalyzed oxidation caused the inactivation of malate dehydrogenase and the aggregation of leghemoglobin. In addition, numerous glycated proteins were identified in vivo, including three key nodule proteins: sucrose synthase, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ine synthetase, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate synthase. Label-free quantification identified 10 plant proteins and 18 bacterial proteins as age-specifically glycated. Overall, our results suggest that the selective carbonylation or glycation of crucial proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and signaling may constitute a mechanism to control cell metabolism and nodule senescence.</p>

A Rice Glutamyl-tRNA Synthetase Modulates Early Anther Cell Division and Patterning
<p>Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) have housekeeping roles in protein synthesis, but little is known about how these aaRSs are involved in organ development. Here, we report that a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>yl-tRNA synthetase (OsERS1) maintains proper somatic cell organization and limits the overproliferation of male germ cells during early anther development. The expression of <i>OsERS1</i> is specifically detectable in meristematic layer 2-derived cells of the early anther, and <i>osers1</i> anthers exhibit overproliferation and disorganization of layer 2-derived cells, producing fused lobes and extra germ cells in early anthers. The conserved biochemical function of OsERS1 in ligating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate to tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> is enhanced by its cofactor aaRS OsARC. Furthermore, metabolomics profiling revealed that OsERS1 is an important node for multiple metabolic pathways, indicated by the accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong>s and tricarboxylic acid cycle components in <i>osers1</i> anthers. Notably, the anther defects of the <i>osers1</i> mutant are causally associated with the abnormal accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, which can reconstitute the <i>osers1</i> phenotype when applied to wild-type anthers.

The α-Terpineol to 1,8-Cineole Cyclization Reaction of Tobacco Terpene Synthases
<p>Flowers of <i>Nicotiana</i> species emit a characteristic blend including the cineole cassette monoterpenes. This set of terpenes is synthesized by multiproduct enzymes, with either 1,8-cineole or α-terpineol contributing most to the volatile spectrum, thus referring to cineole or terpineol synthase, respectively. To understand the molecular and structural requirements of the enzymes that favor the biochemical formation of α-terpineol and 1,8-cineole, site-directed mutagenesis, in silico modeling, and semiempiric calculations were performed. Our results indicate the formation of α-terpineol by a nucleophilic attack of water. During this attack, the α-terpinyl cation is stabilized by π-stacking with a tryptophan side chain (tryptophan-253). The hypothesized catalytic mechanism of α-terpineol-to-1,8-cineole conversion is initiated by a catalytic dyad (histidine-502 and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate-249), acting as a base, and a threonine (threonine-278) providing the subsequent rearrangement from terpineol to cineol by catalyzing the autoprotonation of (<i>S</i>)-(−)-α-terpineol, which is the favored enantiomer product of the recombinant enzymes. Furthermore, by site-directed mutagenesis, we were able to identify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amino acid</span></strong>s at positions 147, 148, and 266 that determine the different terpineol-cineole ratios in <i>Nicotiana</i> <i>suaveolens</i> cineole synthase and <i>Nicotiana</i> <i>langsdorffii</i> terpineol synthase.

Ethylene-Regulated Glutamate Dehydrogenase Fine-Tunes Metabolism during Anoxia-Reoxygenation
<p>Ethylene is an essential hormone in plants that is involved in low-oxygen and reoxygenation responses. As a key transcription factor in ethylene signaling, ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) activates targets that trigger various responses. However, most of these targets are still poorly characterized. Through analyses of our microarray data and the published Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) EIN3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data set, we inferred the putative targets of EIN3 during anoxia-reoxygenation. Among them, <i>GDH2</i>, which encodes one subunit of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate dehydrogenase (GDH), was chosen for further studies for its role in tricarboxylic acid cycle replenishment. We demonstrated that both <i>GDH1</i> and <i>GDH2</i> are induced during anoxia and reoxygenation and that this induction is mediated via ethylene signaling. In addition, the results of enzymatic assays showed that the level of GDH during anoxia-reoxygenation decreased in the ethylene-insensitive mutants <i>ein2-5</i> and <i>ein3eil1</i>. Global metabolite analysis indicated that the deamination activity of GDH might regenerate 2-oxoglutarate, which is a cosubstrate that facilitates the breakdown of alanine by alanine aminotransferase when reoxygenation occurs. Moreover, ineffective tricarboxylic acid cycle replenishment, disturbed carbohydrate metabolism, reduced phytosterol biosynthesis, and delayed energy regeneration were found in <i>gdh1gdh2</i> and ethylene mutants during reoxygenation. Taken together, these data illustrate the essential role of EIN3-regulated GDH activity in metabolic adjustment during anoxia-reoxygenation.</p>

Development of the GABA-ergic signaling system and its role in larval swimming in sea urchin
<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the development and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic regulation of larval swimming in the sea urchin <i>Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus</i> by cloning <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate decarboxylase (<i>Hp-gad</i>), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<i>Hp-gabrA</i>) and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein (<i>Hp-gabarap</i>), and by performing immunohistochemistry. The regulation of larval swimming was increasingly dependent on the GABAergic system, which was active from the 2 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.) pluteus stage onwards. GABA-immunoreactive cells were detected as a subpopulation of secondary mesenchyme cells during gastrulation and eventually constituted the ciliary band and a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells during the pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gad</i> transcription was detected by RT-PCR during the period when Hp-Gad-positive cells were seen as a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells and on the apical side of the ciliary band from the 2 d.p.f. pluteus stage. Consistent with these observations, inhibition of GAD with 3-mercaptopropioninc acid inhibited GABA immunoreactivity and larval swimming dose dependently. <i>Hp-gabrA</i> amplimers were detected weakly in unfertilized eggs and 4 d.p.f. plutei but strongly from fertilized eggs to 2 d.p.f. plutei, and Hp-GabrA, together with GABA, was localized at the ciliary band in association with dopamine receptor D1 from the two-arm pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gabarap</i> transcription and protein expression were detected from the swimming blastula stage. Inhibition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor by bicuculline inhibited larval swimming dose dependently. Inhibition of larval swimming by either 3-mercaptopropionic acid or bicuculline was more severe in older larvae (17 and 34 d.p.f. plutei) than in younger ones (1 d.p.f. prism larvae).</p>

Rapid mitochondrial adjustments in response to short-term hypoxia and re-oxygenation in the Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea gigas</i>
<p>As oxygen concentrations in marine coastal habitats can fluctuate rapidly and drastically, sessile marine organisms such as the oyster <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> can experience marked and rapid oxygen variations. In this study, we investigated the responses of oyster gill mitochondria to short-term hypoxia (3 and 12 h, at 1.7 mg O<sub>2</sub> l<sup>−1</sup>) and subsequent re-oxygenation. Mitochondrial respiratory rates (states 3 and 4 stimulated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ate) and phosphorylation efficiency [respiratory control ratio (RCR) and the relationship between ADP and oxygen consumption (ADP/O)] were measured. Cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (CCO) activity and cytochrome concentrations (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>c</i>) were measured to investigate the rearrangements of respiratory chain subunits. The potential implication of an alternative oxidase (AOX) was investigated using an inhibitor of the respiratory chain (antimycin A) and through gene expression analysis in gills and digestive gland. Results indicate a downregulation of mitochondrial capacity, with 60% inhibition of respiratory rates after 12 h of hypoxia. RCR remained stable, while ADP/O increased after 12 h of hypoxia and 1 h of re-oxygenation, suggesting increased phosphorylation efficiency. CCO showed a fast and remarkable increase of its catalytic activity only after 3 h of hypoxia. AOX mRNA levels showed similar patterns in gills and digestive gland, and were upregulated after 12 and 24 h of hypoxia and during re-oxygenation. Results suggest a set of controls regulating mitochondrial functions in response to oxygen fluctuations, and demonstrate the fast and extreme plasticity of oyster mitochondria in response to oxygen variations.</p>

Genome sequence of <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314
<p>Awamori is a traditional distilled beverage made from steamed Thai-Indica rice in Okinawa, Japan. For brewing the liquor, two microbes, local kuro (black) koji mold <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> and awamori yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> are involved. In contrast, that yeasts are used for ethanol fermentation throughout the world, a characteristic of Japanese fermentation industries is the use of <i>Aspergillus</i> molds as a source of enzymes for the maceration and saccharification of raw materials. Here we report the draft genome of a kuro (black) koji mold, <i>A. luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314 (RIB 2604). The total length of nonredundant sequences was nearly 34.7 Mb, comprising approximately 2,300 contigs with 16 telomere-like sequences. In total, 11,691 genes were predicted to encode proteins. Most of the housekeeping genes, such as transcription factors and <i>N</i>-and <i>O</i>-glycosylation system, were conserved with respect to <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>. An alternative oxidase and acid-stable α-amylase regarding citric acid production and fermentation at a low pH as well as a unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">glutam</span></strong>ic peptidase were also found in the genome. Furthermore, key biosynthetic gene clusters of ochratoxin A and fumonisin B were absent when compared with <i>A. niger</i> genome, showing the safety of <i>A. luchuensis</i> for food and beverage production. This genome information will facilitate not only comparative genomics with industrial kuro-koji molds, but also molecular breeding of the molds in improvements of awamori fermentation.</p>

Quantum correlations from a room-temperature optomechanical cavity
<p>The act of position measurement alters the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of an object being measured. This quantum measurement backaction is typically much smaller than the thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of a room-temperature object and thus difficult to observe. By shining laser light through a nanomechanical beam, we measure the beam’s thermally driven vibrations and perturb its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> with optical force fluctuations at a level dictated by the Heisenberg measurement-disturbance uncertainty relation. We demonstrate a cross-correlation technique to distinguish optically driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> from thermally driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, observing this quantum backaction signature up to room temperature. We use the scale of the quantum correlations, which is determined by fundamental constants, to gauge the size of thermal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, demonstrating a path toward absolute thermometry with quantum mechanically calibrated ticks.</p>

Locked synchronous rotor motion in a molecular motor
<p>Biological molecular motors translate their local directional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> into ordered movement of other parts of the system to empower controlled mechanical functions. The design of analogous geared systems that couple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> in a directional manner, which is pivotal for molecular machinery operating at the nanoscale, remains highly challenging. Here, we report a molecular rotary motor that translates light-driven unidirectional rotary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> to controlled movement of a connected biaryl rotor. Achieving coupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of the distinct parts of this multicomponent mechanical system required precise control of multiple kinetic barriers for isomerization and synchronous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, resulting in sliding and rotation during a full rotary cycle, with the motor always facing the same face of the rotor.</p>

Design and control of gas diffusion process in a nanoporous soft crystal
<p>Design of the gas-diffusion process in a porous material is challenging because a contracted pore aperture is a prerequisite, whereas the channel traffic of guest molecules is regulated by the flexible and dynamic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s of nanochannels. Here, we present the rational design of a diffusion-regulatory system in a porous coordination polymer (PCP) in which flip-flop molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s within the framework structure provide kinetic gate functions that enable efficient gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and storage.

Additionally, we demonstrate the long-lasting physical encapsulation of ethylene at ambient conditions, owing to strongly impeded diffusion in distinctive nanochannels.</p>

Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites

Here we report a microporous metal-organic framework, iron(III) peroxide 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate [Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) (dobdc<sup>4−</sup>: 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)], with iron (Fe)–peroxo sites for the preferential binding of ethane over ethylene and thus highly selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>.

Through a fixed-bed column packed with this porous material, polymer-grade ethylene (99.99% pure) can be straightforwardly produced from ethane/ethylene mixtures during the first adsorption cycle, demonstrating the potential of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for this important industrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation with a low energy cost under ambient conditions.</p>

Systematic Biology
Diversity, Disparity, and Evolutionary Rate Estimation for Unresolved Yule Trees
<p>The branching structure of biological evolution confers statistical dependencies on phenotypic trait values in related organisms. For this reason, comparative macroevolutionary studies usually begin with an inferred phylogeny that describes the evolutionary relationships of the organisms of interest. The probability of the observed trait data can be computed by assuming a model for trait evolution, such as Brownian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, over the branches of this fixed tree. However, the phylogenetic tree itself contributes statistical uncertainty to estimates of rates of phenotypic evolution, and many comparative evolutionary biologists regard the tree as a nuisance parameter. In this article, we present a framework for analytically integrating over unknown phylogenetic trees in comparative evolutionary studies by assuming that the tree arises from a continuous-time Markov branching model called the Yule process. To do this, we derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of phylogenetic diversity (PD), which is the sum of branch lengths connecting the species in a clade. We then present a generalization of PD which is equivalent to the expected trait disparity in a set of taxa whose evolutionary relationships are generated by a Yule process and whose traits evolve by Brownian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>. We find expressions for the distribution of expected trait disparity under a Yule tree. Given one or more observations of trait disparity in a clade, we perform fast likelihood-based estimation of the Brownian variance for unresolved clades. Our method does not require simulation or a fixed phylogenetic tree. We conclude with a brief example illustrating Brownian rate estimation for 12 families in the mammalian order Carnivora, in which the phylogenetic tree for each family is unresolved.

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting chemical inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the chemical composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the chemical environment into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall biochemical environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated chemical inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Large-area graphene-nanomesh/carbon-nanotube hybrid membranes for ionic and molecular nanofiltration
<p>Nanoporous two-dimensional materials are attractive for ionic and molecular nanofiltration but limited by insufficient mechanical strength over large areas. We report a large-area graphene-nanomesh/single-walled carbon nanotube (GNM/SWNT) hybrid membrane with excellent mechanical strength while fully capturing the merit of atomically thin membranes. The monolayer GNM features high-density, subnanometer pores for efficient transport of water molecules while blocking solute ions or molecules to enable size-selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The SWNT network physically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ates the GNM into microsized islands and acts as the microscopic framework to support the GNM, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the atomically thin GNM.

DNA-induced liquid phase condensation of cGAS activates innate immune signaling

The disordered and positively charged cGAS N terminus enhanced cGAS-DNA phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation by increasing the valencies of DNA binding. Long DNA was more efficient in promoting cGAS liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and cGAS enzyme activity than short DNA.

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with yeast prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical yeast prion protein Sup35. In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation followed by gelation. Phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH sensor domain.

Thus, prion-like domains represent conserved environmental stress sensors that facilitate rapid adaptation in unstable environments by modifying protein phase behavior.</p>

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature microspores and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear microspores. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

Anterior lateral line nerve encoding to tones and play-back vocalisations in free-swimming oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>
<p>In the underwater environment, sound propagates both as a pressure wave and as particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>, with particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> dominating close to the source. At the receptor level, the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors, and both are potentially stimulated by the particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> component of sound. The encoding of the anterior lateral line nerve to acoustic stimuli in freely behaving oyster toadfish, <i>Opsanus tau</i>, was examined. Nerve sensitivity and directional responses were determined using spike rate and vector strength analysis, a measure of phase-locking of spike times to the stimulus waveform. All units showed greatest sensitivity to 100 Hz stimulus. While sensitivity was independent of stimuli orientation, the neuron's ability to phase-lock was correlated with stimuli origin. Two different types of units were classified, type 1 (tonic), and type 2 (phasic). The type 1 fibres were further classified into two sub-types based on their frequency response (type 1–1 and type 1–2), which was hypothesised to be related to canal (type 1–1) and superficial (type 1–2) neuromast innervation. Lateral line units also exhibited sensitivity and phase locking to boatwhistle vocalisations, with greatest spike rates exhibited at the onset of the call. These results provide direct evidence that oyster toadfish can use their lateral line to detect behaviourally relevant acoustic stimuli, which could provide a sensory pathway to aid in sound source localisation.</p>

Dynamic pre-BCR homodimers fine-tune autonomous survival signals in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia
<p>The pre–B cell receptor (pre-BCR) is an immature form of the BCR critical for early B lymphocyte development. It is composed of the membrane-bound immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain, surrogate light chain components, and the signaling subunits Igα and Igβ. We developed monovalent quantum dot (QD)–labeled probes specific for Igβ to study the behavior of pre-BCRs engaged in autonomous, ligand-independent signaling in live B cells. Single-particle tracking revealed that QD-labeled pre-BCRs engaged in transient, but frequent, homotypic interactions. Receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> was correlated at short <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation distances, consistent with the formation of dimers and higher-order oligomers. Repeated encounters between diffusing pre-BCRs appeared to reflect transient co-confinement in plasma membrane domains. In human B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells, we showed that frequent, short-lived, homotypic pre-BCR interactions stimulated survival signals, including expression of <i>BCL6</i>, which encodes a transcriptional repressor. These survival signals were blocked by inhibitory monovalent antigen-binding antibody fragments (Fabs) specific for the surrogate light chain components of the pre-BCR or by inhibitors of the tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. For comparison, we evaluated pre-BCR aggregation mediated by dimeric galectin-1, which has binding sites for carbohydrate and for the surrogate light chain λ5 component. Galectin-1 binding resulted in the formation of large, highly immobile pre-BCR aggregates, which was partially relieved by the addition of lactose to prevent the cross-linking of galectin-BCR complexes to other glycosylated membrane components. Analysis of the pre-BCR and its signaling partners suggested that they could be potential targets for combination therapy in BCP-ALL.</p>

Cadherin-11–mediated adhesion of macrophages to myofibroblasts establishes a profibrotic niche of active TGF-β
<p>Macrophages contribute to the activation of fibroblastic cells into myofibroblasts, which secrete collagen and contract the collagen matrix to acutely repair injured tissue. Persistent myofibroblast activation leads to the accumulation of fibrotic scar tissue that impairs organ function. We investigated the key processes that turn acute beneficial repair into destructive progressive fibrosis. We showed that homotypic cadherin-11 interactions promoted the specific binding of macrophages to and persistent activation of profibrotic myofibroblasts. Cadherin-11 was highly abundant at contacts between macrophages and myofibroblasts in mouse and human fibrotic lung tissues. In attachment assays, cadherin-11 junctions mediated specific recognition and strong adhesion between macrophages and myofibroblasts. One functional outcome of cadherin-11–mediated adhesion was locally restricted activation of latent transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) between macrophage-myofibroblast pairs that was not observed in cocultures of macrophages and myofibroblasts that were not in contact with one another. Our data suggest that cadherin-11 junctions maintain latent TGF-β–producing macrophages and TGF-β–activating myofibroblasts in close proximity to one another. Inhibition of homotypic cadherin-11 interactions could be used to cause macrophage-myofibroblast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation, thereby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">destabil</span></strong>izing the profibrotic niche.</p>

Covalent inhibitors of EGFR family protein kinases induce degradation of human Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) pseudokinase in cancer cells
<p>A major challenge associated with biochemical and cellular analysis of pseudokinases is a lack of target-validated small-molecule compounds with which to probe function. Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with a diverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There is substantial evidence that human TRIB2 promotes survival and drug resistance in solid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutic target. The unusual TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-rich C-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminal tail, which also supports its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases. We found that TRIB2 is a target of previously described small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinase domains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Using a thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB2-binding compounds within the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and used a drug repurposing approach to classify compounds that either stabilized or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">destabil</span></strong>ized TRIB2 in vitro. TRIB2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">destabil</span></strong>izing agents, including the covalent drug afatinib, led to rapid TRIB2 degradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signaling and survival. Our data reveal new drug leads for the development of TRIB2-degrading compounds, which will also be invaluable for unraveling the cellular mechanisms of TRIB2-based signaling. Our study highlights that small molecule–induced protein down-regulation through drug “off-targets” might be relevant for other inhibitors that serendipitously target pseudokinases.</p>

ATM directs DNA damage responses and proteostasis via genetically separable pathways
<p>The protein kinase ATM is a master regulator of the DNA damage response but also responds directly to oxidative stress. Loss of ATM causes ataxia telangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder with pleiotropic symptoms that include cerebellar dysfunction, cancer, diabetes, and premature aging. We genetically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated the activation of ATM by DNA damage from that by oxidative stress using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation-of-function mutations. We found that deficient activation of ATM by the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex and DNA double-strand breaks resulted in loss of cell viability, checkpoint activation, and DNA end resection in response to DNA damage. In contrast, loss of oxidative activation of ATM had minimal effects on DNA damage–related outcomes but blocked ATM-mediated initiation of checkpoint responses after oxidative stress and resulted in deficiencies in mitochondrial function and autophagy. In addition, expression of a variant ATM incapable of activation by oxidative stress resulted in widespread protein aggregation. These results indicate a direct relationship between the mechanism of ATM activation and its effects on cellular metabolism and DNA damage responses in human cells and implicate ATM in the control of protein homeostasis.</p>

Stoichiometry controls activity of phase-separated clusters of actin signaling proteins
<p>Biomolecular condensates concentrate macromolecules into foci without a surrounding membrane. Many condensates appear to form through multivalent interactions that drive liquid-liquid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation (LLPS). LLPS increases the specific activity of actin regulatory proteins toward actin assembly by the Arp2/3 complex. We show that this increase occurs because LLPS of the Nephrin–Nck–N-WASP signaling pathway on lipid bilayers increases membrane dwell time of N-WASP and Arp2/3 complex, consequently increasing actin assembly. Dwell time varies with relative stoichiometry of the signaling proteins in the phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated clusters, rendering N-WASP and Arp2/3 activity stoichiometry dependent. This mechanism of controlling protein activity is enabled by the stoichiometrically undefined nature of biomolecular condensates. Such regulation should be a general feature of signaling systems that assemble through multivalent interactions and drive nonequilibrium outputs.</p>

Phase separation focuses DNA sensing
<p>The presence of any double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytosol is a potent trigger for the activation of innate immune responses. In the context of an infection, immunorecognition of “foreign” dsDNA serves as a central host strategy to detect the presence of pathogens. Under certain conditions, however, sensing of aberrant cytosolic self-dsDNA can also promote destructive inflammation in autoinflammatory diseases. A fundamental question is how cells spatially organize and biochemically regulate the recognition of intracellular dsDNA in the vast cytosolic space of a cell. On page 704 in this issue, Du and Chen (<i>1</i>) introduce an elegant explanation by demonstrating that phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of the dsDNA sensor cGAS [cyclic GMP (guanosine monophosphate)–AMP (adenosine monophosphate) synthase] enables this central task.

Coactivator condensation at super-enhancers links phase separation and gene control

Here we demonstrate that the SE-enriched transcriptional coactivators BRD4 and MED1 form nuclear puncta at SEs that exhibit properties of liquid-like condensates and are disrupted by chemicals that perturb condensates. The intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of BRD4 and MED1 can form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated droplets, and MED1-IDR droplets can compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus from nuclear extracts. These results support the idea that coactivators form phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated condensates at SEs that compartmentalize and concentrate the transcription apparatus, suggest a role for coactivator IDRs in this process, and offer insights into mechanisms involved in the control of key cell-identity genes.</p>

RNA buffers the phase separation behavior of prion-like RNA binding proteins
<p>Prion-like RNA binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP43 and FUS are largely soluble in the nucleus but form solid pathological aggregates when mislocalized to the cytoplasm. What keeps these proteins soluble in the nucleus and promotes aggregation in the cytoplasm is still unknown. We report here that RNA critically regulates the phase behavior of prion-like RBPs. Low RNA/protein ratios promote phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation into liquid droplets, whereas high ratios prevent droplet formation in vitro. Reduction of nuclear RNA levels or genetic ablation of RNA binding causes excessive phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation and the formation of cytotoxic solid-like assemblies in cells. We propose that the nucleus is a buffered system in which high RNA concentrations keep RBPs soluble. Changes in RNA levels or RNA binding abilities of RBPs cause aberrant phase transitions.</p>

Spatially distributed multipartite entanglement enables EPR steering of atomic clouds
<p>A key resource for distributed quantum-enhanced protocols is entanglement between spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated modes. However, the robust generation and detection of entanglement between spatially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated regions of an ultracold atomic system remain a challenge. We used spin mixing in a tightly confined Bose-Einstein condensate to generate an entangled state of indistinguishable particles in a single spatial mode. We show experimentally that this entanglement can be spatially distributed by self-similar expansion of the atomic cloud. We used spatially resolved spin read-out to reveal a particularly strong form of quantum correlations known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between distinct parts of the expanded cloud. Based on the strength of EPR steering, we constructed a witness, which confirmed genuine 5-partite entanglement.</p>

Nanofluidic rocking Brownian motors
<p>Control and transport of nanoscale objects in fluids is challenging because of the unfavorable scaling of most interaction mechanisms to small length scales. We designed energy landscapes for nanoparticles by accurately shaping the geometry of a nanofluidic slit and exploiting the electrostatic interaction between like-charged particles and walls. Directed transport was performed by combining asymmetric potentials with an oscillating electric field to achieve a rocking Brownian motor. Using gold spheres 60 nanometers in diameter, we investigated the physics of the motor with high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling a parameter-free comparison with theory. We fabricated a sorting device that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ates 60- and 100-nanometer particles in opposing directions within seconds. Modeling suggests that the device <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ates particles with a radial difference of 1 nanometer.</p>

Structural insights into ion conduction by channelrhodopsin 2
<p>The light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) from <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is a major optogenetic tool. Photon absorption starts a well-characterized photocycle, but the structural basis for the regulation of channel opening remains unclear. We present high-resolution structures of ChR2 and the C128T mutant, which has a markedly increased open-state lifetime. The structure reveals two cavities on the intracellular side and two cavities on the extracellular side. They are connected by extended hydrogen-bonding networks involving water molecules and side-chain residues. Central is the retinal Schiff base that controls and synchronizes three gates that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate the cavities. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ate from this network is the DC gate that comprises a water-mediated bond between C128 and D156 and interacts directly with the retinal Schiff base. Comparison with the C128T structure reveals a direct connection of the DC gate to the central gate and suggests how the gating mechanism is affected by subtle tuning of the Schiff base’s interactions.</p>

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators
<p>Topological phases, like the Haldane phase in spin-1 chains, defy characterization through local order parameters. Instead, nonlocal string order parameters can be employed to reveal their hidden order. Similar diluted magnetic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of spin-charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden magnetic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of nonlocal spin-density correlation functions reveals a hidden finite-range antiferromagnetic order, a direct consequence of spin-charge <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation. Our technique, which measures nonlocal order directly, can be readily extended to higher dimensions to study the complex interplay between magnetic order and density fluctuations.</p>

Mechanism of transmembrane signaling by sensor histidine kinases
<p>One of the major and essential classes of transmembrane (TM) receptors, present in all domains of life, is sensor histidine kinases, parts of two-component signaling systems (TCSs). The structural mechanisms of TM signaling by these sensors are poorly understood. We present crystal structures of the periplasmic sensor domain, the TM domain, and the cytoplasmic HAMP domain of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> nitrate/nitrite sensor histidine kinase NarQ in the ligand-bound and mutated ligand-free states. The structures reveal that the ligand binding induces rearrangements and pistonlike shifts of TM helices. The HAMP domain protomers undergo leverlike <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s and convert these pistonlike <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong>s into helical rotations. Our findings provide the structural framework for complete understanding of TM TCS signaling and for development of antimicrobial treatments targeting TCSs.</p>

Direction-specific van der Waals attraction between rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocrystals
<p>Mutual lattice orientations dictate the types and magnitudes of forces between crystalline particles. When lattice polarizability is anisotropic, the van der Waals dispersion attraction can, in principle, contribute to this direction dependence. We report measurement of this attraction between rutile nanocrystals, as a function of their mutual orientation and surface hydration extent. At tens of nanometers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation, the attraction is weak and shows no dependence on azimuthal alignment or surface hydration. At <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ations of approximately one hydration layer, the attraction is strongly dependent on azimuthal alignment and systematically decreases as intervening water density increases. Measured forces closely agree with predictions from Lifshitz theory and show that dispersion forces can generate a torque between particles interacting in solution and between grains in materials.</p>

Mechanism of Activation of Protein Kinase JAK2 by the Growth Hormone Receptor
<p>Signaling from JAK (Janus kinase) protein kinases to STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) transcription factors is key to many aspects of biology and medicine, yet the mechanism by which cytokine receptors initiate signaling is enigmatic. We present a complete mechanistic model for activation of receptor-bound JAK2, based on an archetypal cytokine receptor, the growth hormone receptor. For this, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor positioning of the JAK2 binding motif in the receptor dimer, substitution of the receptor extracellular domains with Jun zippers to control the position of its transmembrane (TM) helices, atomistic modeling of TM helix movements, and docking of the crystal structures of the JAK2 kinase and its inhibitory pseudokinase domain with an opposing kinase-pseudokinase domain pair. Activation of the receptor dimer induced a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of its JAK2 binding motifs, driven by a ligand-induced transition from a parallel TM helix pair to a left-handed crossover arrangement. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation leads to removal of the pseudokinase domain from the kinase domain of the partner JAK2 and pairing of the two kinase domains, facilitating trans-activation. This model may well generalize to other class I cytokine receptors.</p>

PROTEIN PHOSHATASE 2A B’<i>α</i> and <i>β</i> Maintain Centromeric Sister Chromatid Cohesion during Meiosis in Arabidopsis
<p>The correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I, and sister chromatids during meiosis II, relies on the tight control of the cohesion complex. The phosphorylation and subsequent cleavage of the meiotic recombination protein REC8 (REC8-like family protein [SYN1] in Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>]), the α-kleisin subunit of the cohesion ring, along the chromosome arms at meiosis I allows crossovers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation of homologous chromosomes without chromatid dissociation. REC8 continues to localize and function at the centromeres up to metaphase II and, in yeast and vertebrates, is protected from cleavage by means of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation. Here, we show that, in plants, centromeric sister chromatid cohesion until meiosis II also requires the activity of a PP2A-type phosphatase complex. The combined absence of the regulatory subunits PP2AB′α and PP2AB′β leads to the premature loss of chromosome cohesion in meiosis I. Male meiocytes of the <i>pp2ab′αβ</i> double mutant display premature depletion of SYN1. The PP2AA1 structural and B′α regulatory subunit localize specifically to centromeres until metaphase II, supporting a role for the PP2A complex in the SYN1-mediated maintenance of centromeric cohesion in plant meiosis.</p>

Pea Border Cell Maturation and Release Involve Complex Cell Wall Structural Dynamics
<p>The adhesion of plant cells is vital for support and protection of the plant body and is maintained by a variety of molecular associations between cell wall components. In some specialized cases, though, plant cells are programmed to detach, and root cap-derived border cells are examples of this. Border cells (in some species known as border-like cells) provide an expendable barrier between roots and the environment. Their maturation and release is an important but poorly characterized cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation event. To gain a deeper insight into the complex cellular dynamics underlying this process, we undertook a systematic, detailed analysis of pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) root tip cell walls. Our study included immunocarbohydrate microarray profiling, monosaccharide composition determination, Fourier-transformed infrared microspectroscopy, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of cell wall biosynthetic genes, analysis of hydrolytic activities, transmission electron microscopy, and immunolocalization of cell wall components. Using this integrated glycobiology approach, we identified multiple novel modes of cell wall structural and compositional rearrangement during root cap growth and the release of border cells. Our findings provide a new level of detail about border cell maturation and enable us to develop a model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ation process. We propose that loss of adhesion by the dissolution of homogalacturonan in the middle lamellae is augmented by an active biophysical process of cell curvature driven by the polarized distribution of xyloglucan and extensin epitopes.</p>

Mexican blind cavefish use mouth suction to detect obstacles
<p>Fish commonly use their lateral line system to detect moving bodies such as prey and predators. A remarkable case is the Mexican blind cavefish <i>Astyanax fasciatus</i>, which evolved the ability to detect non-moving obstacles. The swimming body of <i>A. fasciatus</i> generates fluid disturbances, the alteration of which by an obstacle can be sensed by the fish's lateral line system. It is generally accepted that these alterations can provide information on the distance to the obstacle. We observed that <i>A. fasciatus</i> swimming in an unfamiliar environment open and close their mouths at high frequency (0.7–4.5 Hz) in order to generate suction flows. We hypothesized that repeated mouth suction generates a hydrodynamic velocity field, which is altered by an obstacle, inducing pressure gradients in the neuromasts of the lateral line and corresponding strong lateral line stimuli. We observed that the frequency and rate of mouth-opening events varied with the fish's distance to obstacles, a hallmark of pulse-based navigation mechanisms such as echolocation. We formulated a mathematical model of this hitherto unrecognized mechanism of obstacle detection and parameterized it experimentally. This model suggests that suction flows induce lateral line stimuli that are weakly dependent on the fish's speed, and may be an order of magnitude stronger than the correspondent stimuli induced by the fish's gliding body. We illustrate that <i>A. fasciatus</i> can navigate non-visually using a combination of two deeply ancestral and highly conserved mechanisms of ray-finned fishes: the mechanism of sensing water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> by the lateral line system and the mechanism of generating water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> by mouth suction.</p>

Octopaminergic modulation of the visual flight speed regulator of <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that flies' sensitivity to large-field optic flow is increased by the release of octopamine during flight. This increase in gain presumably enhances visually mediated behaviors such as the active regulation of forward speed, a process that involves the comparison of a vision-based estimate of velocity with an internal set point. To determine where in the neural circuit this comparison is made, we selectively silenced the octopamine neurons in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i>, and examined the effect on vision-based velocity regulation in free-flying flies. We found that flies with inactivated octopamine neurons accelerated more slowly in response to visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> than control flies, but maintained nearly the same baseline flight speed. Our results are parsimonious with a circuit architecture in which the internal control signal is injected into the visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> pathway upstream of the interneuron network that estimates groundspeed.</p>

The effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
<p>The effects of flight behavior on physiology and senescence may be profound in insects because of the extremely high metabolic costs of flight. Flight capacity in insects decreases with age; in contrast, limiting flight behavior extends lifespan and slows the age-related loss of antioxidant capacity and accumulation of oxidative damage in flight muscles. In this study, we tested the effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity by measuring wingbeat frequency, the ability to fly in a hypo-dense gas mixture, and metabolic rate in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Specifically, 5-day-old adult flies were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ated into three life-long treatments: (1) those not allowed to fly (no flight), (2) those allowed – but not forced – to fly (voluntary flight) and (3) those mechanically stimulated to fly (induced flight). Flight capacity senesced earliest in flies from the no-flight treatment, followed by the induced-flight group and then the voluntary flight group. Wingbeat frequency senesced with age in all treatment groups, but was most apparent in the voluntary- and induced-flight groups. Metabolic rate during agitated flight senesced earliest and most rapidly in the induced flight group, and was low and uniform throughout age in the no-flight group. Early senescence in the induced-flight group was likely due to the acceleration of deleterious aging phenomena such as the rapid accumulation of damage at the cellular level, while the early loss of flight capacity and low metabolic rates in the no-flight group demonstrate that disuse effects can also significantly alter senescence patterns of whole-insect performance.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the liquid-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the dimensions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies.</p>

Dynamic use of optic flow during pheromone tracking by the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>
<p>Several insects require both olfactory and visual cues during odour-source localisation to successfully locate an odour source. In the male silkmoth, <i>Bombyx mori</i>, detection of the female sex pheromone triggers a programmed walking pattern, starting from a surge (straight-line walking) followed by zigzag walking. Although pheromone-triggered behaviour in silkmoths is well understood, the role of visual cues remains obscure. To address this question, we performed behavioural experiments on tethered-walking moths by recording their loco<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> during stimulation with a pheromone and a visual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> pattern (optic flow). The experiments were conducted under open- and closed-loop visual stimuli. We found that the use of optic flow input was determined by the behavioural state of surge and zigzagging. Silkmoths exhibited an optomotor response, which is a behavioural visual response, by turning towards the same direction as optic flow stimuli only during surge, but not during zigzagging. In addition, modulation of the zigzag walking pattern was observed when the moths were presented with biased closed-loop visual stimuli (visual feedback with biased constant optic flow); however, the directional preference mechanism was different from that of the optomotor response. Based on these findings, we suggest that the optomotor response is utilised for course control during straight-line walking, whereas the absence of optomotor response during zigzagging is used to effectively perform the programmed walking pattern. Considering the neural basis of programmed behaviour, we speculate that at least two visual pathways are involved in the state-dependent use of optic flow during odour tracking behaviour in silkmoths.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">motion</span></strong> programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

The metabolic cost of communicative sound production in bottlenose dolphins (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>)

It is clear that acoustic communication is important to the survival of these marine mammals, yet the metabolic cost of producing whistles and other socials sounds and the energetic consequences of modifying these sounds in response to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance are unknown. We used flow-through respirometry to determine whether the metabolic cost of sound production could be quantified in two captive dolphins producing social sounds (whistles and squawks). On average, we found that metabolic rates measured during 2 min periods of sound production were 1.2 times resting values. Up to 7 min were required for metabolism to return to resting values following vocal periods. The total metabolic cost (over resting values) of the 2 min vocal period plus the required recovery period (163.3 to 2995.9 ml O<sub>2</sub> or 3279.6 to 60,166.7 J) varied by individual as well as by mean duration of sounds produced within the vocal period. Observed variation in received cumulative sound energy levels of vocalizations was not related to total metabolic costs. Furthermore, our empirical findings did not agree with previous theoretical estimates of the metabolic cost of whistles. This study provides the first empirical data on the metabolic cost of sound production in dolphins, which can be used to estimate metabolic costs of vocal responses to environmental perturbations in wild dolphins.</p>

Is it safe to preserve the deltoid when resecting the proximal humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Resection of the proximal humerus for the primary malignant bone   tumour sometimes requires <i>en bloc</i> resection of the   deltoid. However, there is no information in the literature which   helps a surgeon decide whether to preserve the deltoid or not. The   aim of this study was to determine whether retaining the deltoid   at the time of resection would increase the rate of local recurrence.   We also sought to identify the variables that persuade expert surgeons   to choose a deltoid sparing rather than deltoid resecting procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed 45 patients who had undergone resection of a primary   malignant tumour of the proximal humerus. There were 29 in the deltoid   sparing group and 16 in the deltoid resecting group. Imaging studies   were reviewed to assess tumour extension and soft-tissue involvement.   The presence of a fat rim <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">separ</span></strong>ating the tumour from the deltoid   on MRI was particularly noted. The cumulative probability of local   recurrence was calculated in a competing risk scenario.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no significant difference (adjusted p = 0.89) in the   cumulative probability of local recurrence between the deltoid sparing   (7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 to 20) and the deltoid resecting   group (26%, 95% CI 8 to 50). Patients were more likely to be selected   for a deltoid sparing procedure if they presented with a small tumour   (p = 0.0064) with less bone involvement (p = 0.032) and a continuous   fat rim on MRI (p = 0.002) and if the axillary nerve could be identified   (p = 0.037).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A deltoid sparing procedure can provide good local control after   resection of the proximal humerus for a primary malignant bone tumour.   A smaller tumour, the presence of a continuous fat rim and the identification   of the axillary nerve on pre-operative MRI will persuade surgeons   to opt for a deltoid resecting procedure.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1244–9.</p></sec>

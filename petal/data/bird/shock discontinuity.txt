Low-Dose Aspirin Discontinuation and Risk of Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>There are increasing concerns about risks associated with aspirin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ation in the absence of major surgery or bleeding. We investigated whether long-term low-dose aspirin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ation and treatment gaps increase the risk of cardiovascular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a cohort study of 601 527 users of low-dose aspirin for primary or secondary prevention in the Swedish prescription register between 2005 and 2009 who were >40 years of age, were free from previous cancer, and had ≥80% adherence during the first observed year of treatment. Cardiovascular events were identified with the Swedish inpatient and cause-of-death registers. The first 3 months after a major bleeding or surgical procedure were excluded from the time at risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During a median of 3.0 years of follow-up, 62 690 cardiovascular events occurred. Patients who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ed aspirin had a higher rate of cardiovascular events than those who continued (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–1.41), corresponding to an additional cardiovascular event observed per year in 1 of every 74 patients who <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>e aspirin. The risk increased shortly after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ation and did not appear to diminish over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In long-term users, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ation of low-dose aspirin in the absence of major surgery or bleeding was associated with a >30% increased risk of cardiovascular events. Adherence to low-dose aspirin treatment in the absence of major surgery or bleeding is likely an important treatment goal.</p></sec>

Myocardial Infarction Risk After Discontinuation of Thienopyridine Therapy in the Randomized DAPT Study (Dual Antiplatelet Therapy)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Thienopyridine plus aspirin beyond 1 year after coronary stenting reduces myocardial infarction (MI) risk and increases bleeding risk in comparison with aspirin alone. The hazard associated with late thienopyridine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ation and risk factors for MI after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ation are poorly defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In the DAPT Study (Dual Antiplatelet Therapy), after percutaneous coronary intervention and 12 months of thienopyridine (clopidogrel or prasugrel) plus aspirin, eligible patients remained on aspirin and were randomly assigned to continued thienopyridine versus placebo for 18 months. At 30 months, patients stopped the study drug and were observed for 3 months. Cumulative incidence of MI was assessed over 3 months after randomization (months 12–15) and 3 months after study drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ation (months 30–33). The MI hazard for each of these periods was assessed across randomized treatment arms and by DAPT score values <2 or ≥2.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 11 648 randomly assigned patients, the monthly cumulative incidence of MI was lower with continued thienopyridine versus placebo at 12 to 15 months (0.12% versus 0.37%, <i>P</i><0.001, in all patients; 0.13% versus 0.27%, <i>P</i>=0.02, in patients not treated with paclitaxel-eluting stents), and higher at 30 to 33 months (0.30% versus 0.15%, <i>P</i>=0.013, in all patients; in patients without paclitaxel-eluting stents, 0.18% versus 0.17%, <i>P</i>=0.91). The majority of MIs in both time periods (74% and 76%) were not related to stent thrombosis. After multivariable adjustment, treatment arm independently predicted MI at months 12 to 15 (<i>P</i><0.001) and 30 to 33 (<i>P</i>=0.011). During months 12 to 15, patients with DAPT scores <2 or ≥2 both had lower rates of MI with continued thienopyridine (MI monthly incidence 0.16% versus 0.51%, <i>P</i><0.001, for scores ≥2; 0.08% versus 0.24%, <i>P</i>=0.012, for scores<2, interaction <i>P</i>=0.064).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ing thienopyridine after either 12 or 30 months is associated with an early increase in MI risk, mainly unrelated to stent thrombosis; the magnitude of risk is highest in the earlier time frame, and lower in patients not treated with paclitaxel-eluting stents. Although higher DAPT scores identify patients with greater absolute ischemic benefit (relative to bleeding harm) with continued thienopyridine therapy, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ation at 12 months increases MI hazard regardless of DAPT score group.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth correlations over the last century as well as from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly correlated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate correlations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

A unified continental thickness from seismology and diamonds suggests a melt-defined plate
<p>Thick, rigid continents move over the weaker underlying mantle, although geophysical and geochemical constraints on the exact thickness and defining mechanism of the continental plates are widely discrepant. Xenoliths suggest a chemical continental lithosphere ~175 kilometers thick, whereas seismic tomography supports a much thicker root (>250 kilometers) and a gradual lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, consistent with a thermal definition. We modeled <i>SS</i> precursor waveforms from continental interiors and found a 7 to 9% velocity drop at depths of 130 to 190 kilometers. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ity depth is well correlated with the origin depths of diamond-bearing xenoliths and corresponds to the transition from coarse to deformed xenoliths. At this depth, the xenolith-derived geotherm also intersects the carbonate-silicate solidus, suggesting that partial melt defines the plate boundaries beneath the continental interior.</p>

Root diffusion barrier control by a vasculature-derived peptide binding to the SGN3 receptor
<p>The root endodermis forms its extracellular diffusion barrier by developing ringlike impregnations called Casparian strips. A factor responsible for their establishment is the SCHENGEN3/GASSHO1 (SGN3/GSO1) receptor-like kinase. Its loss of function causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ous Casparian strips. SGN3 also mediates endodermal overlignification of other Casparian strip mutants. Yet, without ligand, SGN3 function remained elusive. Here we report that <i>schengen2 (sgn2)</i> is defective in an enzyme sulfating peptide ligands. On the basis of this observation, we identified two stele-expressed peptides (CASPARIAN STRIP INTEGRITY FACTORS, CIF1/2) that complement <i>sgn2</i> at nanomolar concentrations and induce Casparian strip mislocalization as well as overlignification—all of which depend on SGN3. Direct peptide binding to recombinant SGN3 identifies these peptides as SGN3 ligands. We speculate that CIF1/2-SGN3 is part of a barrier surveillance system, evolved to guarantee effective sealing of the supracellular Casparian strip network.</p>

Management of massive acetabular bone defects in revision arthroplasty of the hip using a reconstruction cage and porous metal augment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>It may not be possible to undertake revision total hip arthroplasty   (THA) in the presence of massive loss of acetabular bone stock using   standard cementless hemispherical acetabular components and metal   augments, as satisfactory stability cannot always be achieved. We   aimed to study the outcome using a reconstruction cage and a porous   metal augment in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 22 acetabular revisions in 19 patients were performed   using a combination of a reconstruction cage and porous metal augments.   The augments were used in place of structural allografts. The mean   age of the patients at the time of surgery was 70 years (27 to 85)   and the mean follow-up was 39 months (27 to 58). The mean number   of previous THAs was 1.9 (1 to 3). All patients had segmental defects   involving more than 50% of the acetabulum and seven hips had an   associated pelvic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discontinu</span></strong>ity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Three failures were observed in two hips, both of which had undergone   a previous resection of a tumour affecting the acetabulum. Other   complications included a late arterial injury, a sciatic nerve palsy,   a dislocation treated with a femoral revision, a deep infection   treated with irrigation and debridement and a fracture of the greater   trochanter treated conservatively. The mean Oxford Hip Score significantly   increased from 13.9 (2 to 23) to 28.7 (13 to 38) (p < 0.00001).   The mean vertical distance between the centre of rotation of the   hip and its normal location decreased from 30 mm to 10 mm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Acceptable early survivorship can be achieved using this novel   technique, but it may be unsuitable for use in patients who have   previously undergone the resection of a tumour involving the acetabulum.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:607–13.</p></sec>

Pharmacodynamic Effects of Switching From Ticagrelor to Clopidogrel in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Switching between different classes of P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, including de-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel, commonly occurs in clinical practice. However, the pharmacodynamic profiles of this strategy have been poorly explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, open-label study conducted in patients on maintenance dosing (MD) of aspirin (81 mg/d) and clopidogrel (75 mg/d). After a 7-day run-in with ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose [LD] followed by 90 mg twice daily MD), patients (n=80) were randomized into 1 of 4 groups: group A, clopidogrel 600 mg LD 24 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-600 mg-24h); group B, clopidogrel 600 mg LD 12 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-600 mg-12h); group C, clopidogrel 75 mg/d MD 24 hours after the last MD of ticagrelor (C-75 mg-24h); and group D, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily MD (T-90 mg twice daily). MD of the randomized treatment was maintained for 10±3 days. Pharmacodynamic assessments were performed at baseline, after run-in, and at 2, 24, 48, and 72 hours and 10 days with P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction units by VerifyNow; platelet reactivity index was assessed by vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein; and maximal platelet aggregation was determined by light transmittance aggregometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>T-90 mg twice daily led to lower platelet reactivity than any clopidogrel regimen using all assays at all time points. P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction unit levels were similar between the C-600 mg-24h (group A) and the C-75 mg-24h (group C) (<i>P</i>=0.29), including at 48 hours (primary end point; least mean difference, −6.9; 95% confidence interval, −38.1 to 24.3; <i>P</i>=0.66). P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction unit levels were lower with C-600 mg-12h (group B) than with C-75 mg-24h (group C; <i>P</i>=0.024). Maximal platelet aggregation over time was lower with both C-600 mg-24h (group A; <i>P</i>=0.041) and C-600 mg-12h (group B; <i>P</i>=0.028) compared with C-75 mg-24h (group C). Platelet reactivity index profiles paralleled those observed with P2Y<sub>12</sub> reaction units. There were no pharmacodynamic differences for all tests between C-600 mg-24h (group A) and C-600 mg-12h (group B). In group C (C-75 mg-24h), platelet reactivity increased compared with baseline as early as 24 hours, reaching statistical significance at 48 and 72 hours and up to 10 days. These pharmacodynamic findings were delayed and blunted in magnitude with the administration of an LD, regardless of the timing of administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>De-escalation from ticagrelor to clopidogrel therapy is associated with an increase in platelet reactivity.

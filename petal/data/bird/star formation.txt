An excess of massive stars in the local 30 Doradus starburst
<p>The 30 Doradus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud is a nearby analog of large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-formation events in the distant universe. We determined the recent formation history and the initial mass function (IMF) of massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s in 30 Doradus on the basis of spectroscopic observations of 247 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s more massive than 15 solar masses ([Formula]). The main episode of massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation began about 8 million years (My) ago, and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-formation rate seems to have declined in the last 1 My. The IMF is densely sampled up to 200 [Formula] and contains 32 ± 12% more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s above 30 [Formula] than predicted by a standard Salpeter IMF. In the mass range of 15 to 200 [Formula], the IMF power-law exponent is [Formula], shallower than the Salpeter value of 2.35.</p>

Fast molecular outflow from a dusty star-forming galaxy in the early Universe
<p>Galaxies grow inefficiently, with only a small percentage of the available gas converted into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s each free-fall time. Feedback processes, such as outflowing winds driven by radiation pressure, supernovae, or supermassive black hole accretion, can act to halt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation if they heat or expel the gas supply. We report a molecular outflow launched from a dust-rich <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>-forming galaxy at redshift 5.3, 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The outflow reaches velocities up to 800 kilometers per second relative to the galaxy, is resolved into multiple clumps, and carries mass at a rate within a factor of 2 of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation r</span></strong>ate. Our results show that molecular outflows can remove a large fraction of the gas available for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation from galaxies at high redshift.</p>

Illuminating gravitational waves: A concordant picture of photons from a neutron star merger
<p>Merging neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s offer an excellent laboratory for simultaneously studying strong-field gravity and matter in extreme environments. We establish the physical association of an electromagnetic counterpart (EM170817) with gravitational waves (GW170817) detected from merging neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s. By synthesizing a panchromatic data set, we demonstrate that merging neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s are a long-sought production site forging heavy elements by r-process nucleosynthesis. The weak gamma rays seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-ray bursts with ultrarelativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet explains the low-luminosity gamma rays, the high-luminosity ultraviolet-optical-infrared, and the delayed radio and x-ray emission. We posit that all neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> mergers may lead to a wide-angle cocoon breakout, sometimes accompanied by a successful jet and sometimes by a choked jet.</p>

Intertidal sea stars (<i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>) alter body shape in response to wave action
<p>Sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s are some of the largest mobile animals able to live in the harsh flow environment of wave-exposed, rocky intertidal shores. In addition, some species, such as the northeastern Pacific <i>Pisaster ochraceus</i>, are ecologically significant predators in a broad range of environments, from sheltered lagoons to the most wave-exposed shorelines. How they function and survive under such an extreme range of wave exposures remains a puzzle. Here we examine the ability of <i>P. ochraceus</i> to alter body form in response to variation in flow conditions. We found that sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s in wave-exposed sites had narrower arms and were lighter per unit arm length than those from sheltered sites. Body form was tightly correlated with maximum velocity of breaking waves across four sites and also varied over time. In addition, field transplant experiments showed that these differences in shape were due primarily to phenotypic plasticity. Sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s transplanted from a sheltered site to a more wave-exposed site became lighter per unit arm length, and developed narrower arms, after 3 months. The tight correlation between water flow and morphology suggests that wave force must be a significant selective factor acting on body shape. On exposed shores, narrower arms probably reduce both lift and drag in breaking waves. On protected shores, fatter arms may provide more thermal inertia to resist overheating, or more body volume for gametes. Such plastic changes in body shape represent a unique method by which sea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s adapt to spatial, seasonal and possibly short-term variation in flow conditions.</p>

Asteroseismic detection of latitudinal differential rotation in 13 Sun-like stars

For the most significant detections, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s’ equators rotate approximately twice as fast as their midlatitudes.

A precise measurement of the magnetic field in the corona of the black hole binary V404 Cygni
<p>Observations of binary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s containing an accreting black hole or neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> often show x-ray emission extending to high energies (>10 kilo­–electron volts), which is ascribed to an accretion disk corona of energetic particles akin to those seen in the solar corona. Despite their ubiquity, the physical conditions in accretion disk coronae remain poorly constrained. Using simultaneous infrared, optical, x-ray, and radio observations of the Galactic black hole system V404 Cygni, showing a rapid synchrotron cooling event in its 2015 outburst, we present a precise 461 ± 12 gauss magnetic field measurement in the corona. This measurement is substantially lower than previous estimates for such systems, providing constraints on physical models of accretion physics in black hole and neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> binary systems.</p>

Supersonic gas streams enhance the formation of massive black holes in the early universe
<p>The origin of super-massive black holes in the early universe remains poorly understood. Gravitational collapse of a massive primordial gas cloud is a promising initial process, but theoretical studies have difficulty growing the black hole fast enough. We report numerical simulations of early black hole formation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>ting from realistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmolog</span></strong>ical conditions. Supersonic gas motions left over from the Big Bang prevent early gas cloud formation until rapid gas condensation is triggered in a protogalactic halo. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">proto<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong></span></strong> is formed in the dense, turbulent gas cloud, and it grows by sporadic mass accretion until it acquires 34,000 solar masses.

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The magnetic fields of solar-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the turbulent convective layers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s and have a complex dependency upon stellar rotation rate. We have performed a set of turbulent global simulations that exhibit magnetic cycles varying systematically with stellar rotation and luminosity. We find that the magnetic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of rotation on turbulent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s.</p>

Relativistic deflection of background starlight measures the mass of a nearby white dwarf star
<p>Gravitational deflection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>light around the Sun during the 1919 total solar eclipse provided measurements that confirmed Einstein’s general theory of relativity. We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the analogous process of astrometric microlensing caused by a nearby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>, the white dwarf Stein 2051 B. As Stein 2051 B passed closely in front of a background <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>, the background <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>’s position was deflected. Measurement of this deflection at multiple epochs allowed us to determine the mass of Stein 2051 B—the sixth-nearest white dwarf to the Sun—as 0.675 ± 0.051 solar masses. This mass determination provides confirmation of the physics of degenerate matter and lends support to white dwarf evolutionary theory.</p>

Spiral density waves in a young protoplanetary disk
<p>Gravitational forces are expected to excite spiral density waves in protoplanetary disks, disks of gas and dust orbiting young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s. However, previous observations that showed spiral structure were not able to probe disk midplanes, where most of the mass is concentrated and where planet formation takes place. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we detected a pair of trailing symmetric spiral arms in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> Elias 2-27. The arms extend to the disk outer regions and can be traced down to the midplane. These millimeter-wave observations also reveal an emission gap closer to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> than the spiral arms. We argue that the observed spirals trace shocks of spiral density waves in the midplane of this young disk.</p>

Compact radio emission indicates a structured jet was produced by a binary neutron star merger
<p>The binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> merger event GW170817 was detected through both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves. Its afterglow emission may have been produced by either a narrow relativistic jet or an isotropic outflow. High-spatial-resolution measurements of the source size and displacement can discriminate between these scenarios. We present very-long-baseline interferometry observations, performed 207.4 days after the merger by using a global network of 32 radio telescopes. The apparent source size is constrained to be smaller than 2.5 milli–arc seconds at the 90% confidence level. This excludes the isotropic outflow scenario, which would have produced a larger apparent size, indicating that GW170817 produced a structured relativistic jet. Our rate calculations show that at least 10% of neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> mergers produce such a jet.</p>

A whirling plane of satellite galaxies around Centaurus A challenges cold dark matter cosmology
<p>The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are each surrounded by a thin plane of satellite dwarf galaxies that may be corotating. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmolog</span></strong>ical simulations predict that most satellite galaxy systems are close to isotropic with random motions, so those two well-studied systems are often interpreted as rare statistical outliers. We test this assumption using the kinematics of satellite galaxies around the Centaurus A galaxy. Our statistical analysis reveals evidence for corotation in a narrow plane: Of the 16 Centaurus A satellites with kinematic data, 14 follow a coherent velocity pattern aligned with the long axis of their spatial distribution. In standard <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmolog</span></strong>ical simulations, <0.5% of Centaurus A–like systems show such behavior. Corotating satellite systems may be common in the universe, challenging small-scale structure formation in the prevailing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmolog</span></strong>ical paradigm.</p>

Early spectra of the gravitational wave source GW170817: Evolution of a neutron star merger
<p>On 17 August 2017, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) was discovered as the optical counterpart of the binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> gravitational wave event GW170817. We report time-series spectroscopy of SSS17a from 11.75 hours until 8.5 days after the merger. Over the first hour of observations, the ejecta rapidly expanded and cooled. Applying blackbody fits to the spectra, we measured the photosphere cooling from [Formula] to [Formula] kelvin, and determined a photospheric velocity of roughly 30% of the speed of light. The spectra of SSS17a began displaying broad features after 1.46 days and evolved qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) components. The late-time component is consistent with theoretical models of r-process–enriched neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> ejecta, whereas the blue component requires high-velocity, lanthanide-free material.</p>

Light curves of the neutron star merger GW170817/SSS17a: Implications for r-process nucleosynthesis
<p>On 17 August 2017, gravitational waves (GWs) were detected from a binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a), was subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present ultraviolet, optical, and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9 hours to 18 days postmerger. We constrain the radioactively powered transient resulting from the ejection of neutron-rich material. The fast rise of the light curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with multiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time light curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy elements, demonstrating that neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> mergers play a role in rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis in the universe.</p>

<i>Swift</i> and <i>NuSTAR</i> observations of GW170817: Detection of a blue kilonova

The bright, rapidly fading UV emission indicates a high mass (≈0.03 solar masses) wind-driven outflow with moderate electron fraction (<i>Y</i><sub>e</sub> ≈ 0.27). Combined with the x-ray limits, we favor an observer viewing angle of ≈30° away from the orbital rotation axis, which avoids both obscuration from the heaviest elements in the orbital plane and a direct view of any ultrarelativistic, highly collimated ejecta (a γ-ray burst afterglow).</p>

Lifetime of the solar nebula constrained by meteorite paleomagnetism

We present paleomagnetic analyses of volcanic angrites demonstrating that they formed in a near-zero magnetic field (<0.6 microtesla) at 4563.5 ± 0.1 million years ago, ~3.8 million years after solar system formation. This indicates that the solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong> field, and likely the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nebula</span></strong>r gas, had dispersed by this time.

The core dynamo on the angrite parent body did not initiate until about 4 to 11 million years after solar system formation.</p>

Close-range remote sensing of Saturn’s rings during Cassini’s ring-grazing orbits and Grand Finale

There are fine-scaled correlations among optical depth, spectral properties, and temperature in the B ring, but anticorrelations within strong density waves in the A ring. There is no spectral distinction between plateaux and the rest of the C ring, whereas the region outward of the Keeler gap is spectrally distinct from nearby regions. These results likely indicate that radial stratification of particle physical properties, rather than compositional differences, is responsible for producing these ring structures.</p>

A loud quasi-periodic oscillation after a star is disrupted by a massive black hole
<p>The tidal forces close to massive black holes can rip apart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong>s that come too close to them. As the resulting stellar debris spirals toward the black hole, the debris heats up and emits x-rays. We report observations of a stable 131-second x-ray quasi-periodic oscillation from the tidal disruption event ASASSN-14li. Assuming the black hole mass indicated by host galaxy scaling relations, these observations imply that the periodicity originates from close to the event horizon and that the black hole is rapidly spinning. Our findings demonstrate that tidal disruption events can generate quasi-periodic oscillations that encode information about the physical properties of their black holes.</p>

The well-structured multiple layers of electron populations indicate that the dominant electron dynamics are mostly laminar, despite the presence of turbulence near the reconnection site.</p>

A dust-enshrouded tidal disruption event with a resolved radio jet in a galaxy merger
<p>Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are transient flares produced when a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> is ripped apart by the gravitational field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). We have observed a transient source in the western nucleus of the merging galaxy pair Arp 299 that radiated >1.5 × 10<sup>52</sup> erg at infrared and radio wavelengths but was not luminous at optical or x-ray wavelengths. We interpret this as a TDE with much of its emission reradiated at infrared wavelengths by dust. Efficient reprocessing by dense gas and dust may explain the difference between theoretical predictions and observed luminosities of TDEs. The radio observations resolve an expanding and decelerating jet, probing the jet formation and evolution around a SMBH.</p>

Multimessenger observations of a flaring blazar coincident with high-energy neutrino IceCube-170922A
<p>Previous detections of individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">astrophys</span></strong>ical sources of neutrinos are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017, we detected a high-energy neutrino, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of ~290 tera–electron volts. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known γ-ray blazar, TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to γ-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy γ-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a γ-ray–emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.</p>

<p>A high-energy neutrino event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056.

We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5σ evidence for neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode.

We report the detection of normal vibrational modes in the isolated interstellar cloud Musca, allowing determination of the 3D physical dimensions of the cloud. We found that Musca is vibrating globally, with the characteristic modes of a sheet viewed edge on, not the characteristics of a filament as previously supposed. We reconstructed the physical properties of Musca through 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, reproducing the observed normal modes and confirming a sheetlike morphology.</p>

Measurement of the neutron lifetime using a magneto-gravitational trap and in situ detection
<p>The precise value of the mean neutron lifetime, τ<sub>n</sub>, plays an important role in nuclear and particle physics and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmolog</span></strong>y. It is used to predict the ratio of protons to helium atoms in the primordial universe and to search for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. We eliminated loss mechanisms present in previous trap experiments by levitating polarized ultracold neutrons above the surface of an asymmetric storage trap using a repulsive magnetic field gradient so that the stored neutrons do not interact with material trap walls. As a result of this approach and the use of an in situ neutron detector, the lifetime reported here [877.7 ± 0.7 (stat) +0.4/–0.2 (sys) seconds] does not require corrections larger than the quoted uncertainties.</p>

Electromagnetic evidence that SSS17a is the result of a binary neutron star merger
<p>Eleven hours after the detection of gravitational wave source GW170817 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Virgo Interferometers, an associated optical transient, SSS17a, was identified in the galaxy NGC 4993. Although the gravitational wave data indicate that GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints on the nature of that system. We synthesize the optical to near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration, finding that SSS17a is unlike other known transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process). We conclude that SSS17a was the result of a binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> merger, reinforcing the gravitational wave result.</p>

A radio counterpart to a neutron star merger
<p>Gravitational waves have been detected from a binary neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> merger event, GW170817. The detection of electromagnetic radiation from the same source has shown that the merger occurred in the outskirts of the galaxy NGC 4993, at a distance of 40 megaparsecs from Earth. We report the detection of a counterpart radio source that appears 16 days after the event, allowing us to diagnose the energetics and environment of the merger. The observed radio emission can be explained by either a collimated ultrarelativistic jet, viewed off-axis, or a cocoon of mildly relativistic ejecta. Within 100 days of the merger, the radio light curves will enable observers to distinguish between these models, and the angular velocity and geometry of the debris will be directly measurable by very long baseline interferometry.</p>

Extended gamma-ray sources around pulsars constrain the origin of the positron flux at Earth
<p>The unexpectedly high flux of cosmic-ray positrons detected at Earth may originate from nearby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">astrophys</span></strong>ical sources, dark matter, or unknown processes of cosmic-ray secondary production. We report the detection, using the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), of extended tera–electron volt gamma-ray emission coincident with the locations of two nearby middle-aged pulsars (Geminga and PSR B0656+14). The HAWC observations demonstrate that these pulsars are indeed local sources of accelerated leptons, but the measured tera–electron volt emission profile constrains the diffusion of particles away from these sources to be much slower than previously assumed. We demonstrate that the leptons emitted by these objects are therefore unlikely to be the origin of the excess positrons, which may have a more exotic origin.</p>

Mapping spiral structure on the far side of the Milky Way
<p>Little is known about the portion of the Milky Way lying beyond the Galactic center at distances of more than 9 kiloparsec from the Sun. These regions are opaque at optical wavelengths because of absorption by interstellar dust, and distances are very large and hard to measure. We report a direct trigonometric parallax distance of <bold>[Formula]</bold> kiloparsec obtained with the Very Long Baseline Array to a water maser source in a region of active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation. These measurements allow us to shed light on Galactic spiral structure by locating the Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm as it passes through the far side of the Milky Way and to validate a kinematic method for determining distances in this region on the basis of transverse motions.</p>

An unusual white dwarf star may be a surviving remnant of a subluminous Type Ia supernova
<p>Subluminous Type Ia supernovae, such as the Type Iax–class prototype SN 2002cx, are described by a variety of models such as the failed detonation and partial deflagration of an accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> or the explosion of an accreting, hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon core. These models predict that bound remnants survive such events with, according to some simulations, a high kick velocity. We report the discovery of a high proper motion, low-mass white dwarf (LP 40-365) that travels at a velocity greater than the Galactic escape velocity and whose peculiar atmosphere is dominated by intermediate-mass elements. Strong evidence indicates that this partially burnt remnant was ejected following a subluminous Type Ia supernova event. This supports the viability of single-degenerate supernova progenitors.</p>

Measurement of the small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium using close quasar pairs
<p>The distribution of diffuse gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM) imprints a series of hydrogen absorption lines on the spectra of distant background quasars known as the Lyman-α forest. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict that IGM density fluctuations are suppressed below a characteristic scale where thermal pressure balances gravity. We measured this pressure-smoothing scale by quantifying absorption correlations in a sample of close quasar pairs. We compared our measurements to hydrodynamical simulations, where pressure smoothing is determined by the integrated thermal history of the IGM. Our findings are consistent with standard models for photoionization heating by the ultraviolet radiation backgrounds that reionized the universe.</p>

An accreting pulsar with extreme properties drives an ultraluminous x-ray source in NGC 5907
<p>Ultraluminous x-ray sources (ULXs) in nearby galaxies shine brighter than any x-ray source in our Galaxy. ULXs are usually modeled as stellar-mass black holes (BHs) accreting at very high rates or intermediate-mass BHs. We present observations showing that NGC 5907 ULX is instead an x-ray accreting neutron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> (NS) with a spin period evolving from 1.43 seconds in 2003 to 1.13 seconds in 2014. It has an isotropic peak luminosity of [Formula]1000 times the Eddington limit for a NS at 17.1 megaparsec. Standard accretion models fail to explain its luminosity, even assuming beamed emission, but a strong multipolar magnetic field can describe its properties. These findings suggest that other extreme ULXs (x-ray luminosity [Formula] 10<sup>41 </sup>erg second[Formula]) might harbor NSs.</p>

The magnetic field and turbulence of the cosmic web measured using a brilliant fast radio burst
<p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration events thought to originate beyond the Milky Way galaxy. Uncertainty surrounding the burst sources, and their propagation through intervening plasma, has limited their use as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmolog</span></strong>ical probes. We report on a mildly dispersed (dispersion measure 266.5 ± 0.1 parsecs per cubic centimeter), exceptionally intense (120 ± 30 janskys), linearly polarized, scintillating burst (FRB 150807) that we directly localize to 9 square arc minutes. On the basis of a low Faraday rotation (12.0 ± 0.7 radians per square meter), we infer negligible magnetization in the circum-burst plasma and constrain the net magnetization of the cosmic web along this sightline to <21 nanogauss, parallel to the line-of-sight. The burst scintillation suggests weak turbulence in the ionized intergalactic medium.</p>

Molecular gas in the halo fuels the growth of a massive cluster galaxy at high redshift
<p>The largest galaxies in the universe reside in galaxy clusters. Using sensitive observations of carbon monoxide, we show that the Spiderweb galaxy—a massive galaxy in a distant protocluster—is forming from a large reservoir of molecular gas. Most of this molecular gas lies between the protocluster galaxies and has low velocity dispersion, indicating that it is part of an enriched intergalactic medium. This may constitute the reservoir of gas that fuels the widespread <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">star</span></strong> formation seen in earlier ultraviolet observations of the Spiderweb galaxy. Our results support the notion that giant galaxies in clusters formed from extended regions of recycled gas at high redshift.</p>

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The dynamics of many-body systems spanning condensed matter, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">cosmolog</span></strong>y, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase transitions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose condensates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives condensates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the condensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.</p>

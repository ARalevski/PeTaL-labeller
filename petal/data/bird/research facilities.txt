Synovasure ‘quick test’ is not as accurate as the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow test kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow test kit for the diagnosis of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion criteria were all clinical studies where the diagnosis   of PJI was uncertain. All studies selected used the Musculoskeletal   Infection Society (MSIS) or modified MSIS criteria. Two independent   reviewers reviewed the studies and extracted data. A meta-analysis   of results was carried out: pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive   and negative likelihood ratio, heterogeneity and areas under curves   are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ten studies (759 patients) were included. Of these, seven studies   (640 patients) evaluated the laboratory-based α-defensin immunoassay   and three (119 patients) the lateral flow test. The pooled sensitivity   and specificity of the qualitative α-defensin laboratory immunoassay   was 0.953 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 0.984) and 0.965 (95%   CI 0.943 to 0.979) respectively. The pooled positive likelihood   ratio (PLR) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were 34.86 (95%   CI 19.34 to 62.85) and 0.02 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.11). The pooled sensitivity   and specificity of the lateral flow test were 0.774 (95% CI 0.637   to 0.870) and 0.913 (95% CI 0.828 to 0.958), respectively. The pooled   PLR and NLR were 8.675 (95% CI 4.229 to 17.794) and 0.248 (95% CI   0.147 to 0.418), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the lateral flow test   were lower than those of the   α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay test. Hence, care must be   taken with interpretation of the lateral flow test when relying   on its results for the intra-operative diagnosis of PJI.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:66–72.</p></sec>

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental questions remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. We built a global model of aerosol formation by using extensive laboratory measurements of rates of nucleation involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, ions, and organic compounds conducted in the CERN CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) chamber. The simulations and a comparison with atmospheric observations show that nearly all nucleation throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds, in addition to sulfuric acid. A considerable fraction of nucleation involves ions, but the relatively weak dependence on ion concentrations indicates that for the processes studied, variations in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through nucleation in the present-day atmosphere.</p>

An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) sensors on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD probes. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation probes were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional sensors were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD sensors as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around sensors installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. Sensors with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after sensor installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

Assessment of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain
<p>Methane emissions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were estimated by using ground-based, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ity-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for ~30% of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally, our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ity-based estimate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 ± 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas combustion. Substantial emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.</p>

Digitization of multistep organic synthesis in reactionware for on-demand pharmaceuticals
<p>Chemical manufacturing is often done at large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ities that require a sizable capital investment and then produce key compounds for a finite period. We present an approach to the manufacturing of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals in a self-contained plastic reactionware device. The device was designed and constructed by using a chemical to computer-automated design (ChemCAD) approach that enables the translation of traditional bench-scale synthesis into a platform-independent digital code. This in turn guides production of a three-dimensional printed device that encloses the entire synthetic route internally via simple operations. We demonstrate the approach for the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor agonist, (±)-baclofen, establishing a concept that paves the way for the local manufacture of drugs outside of specialist <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ities.</p>

Similar specificities of symbiont uptake by adults and larvae in an anemone model system for coral biology
<p>Reef-building corals depend for much of their energy on photosynthesis by symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (genus <i>Symbiodinium</i>) that live within their gastrodermal cells. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning this ecologically critical symbiosis, including those governing the specificity of symbiont uptake by the host, remain poorly understood, in part because of the difficulties of working with corals in the laboratory. Here, we used the small symbiotic sea anemone <i>Aiptasia</i> as an experimentally tractable model system to analyze the specificity and timing of symbiosis onset in larval and adult animals under controlled laboratory conditions. Using four clonal, axenic <i>Symbiodinium</i> strains, we found no difference in uptake specificity between larvae (even when very young) and adults. Although both compatible and incompatible algal strains were found within the larval guts, only the former appeared to be internalized by gastrodermal cells, and they (but not incompatible algae) proliferated rapidly within the larvae in the absence of detectable exchange with other larvae. Older larvae showed reduced ingestion of both compatible and incompatible algae, and the addition of food failed to promote the uptake of an incompatible algal strain. Thus, <i>Aiptasia</i> adults and larvae appear to have similar mechanisms for discriminating between compatible and incompatible dinoflagellate types prior to phagocytosis by host gastrodermal cells. Whether a particular algal strain is compatible or incompatible appears to be stable during years of axenic culture in the absence of a host. These studies provide a foundation for future analyses of the mechanisms of symbiont-uptake specificity in this emerging model system.</p>

Development
Identification of <i>Ssm1b</i>, a novel modifier of DNA methylation, and its expression during mouse embryogenesis
<p>The strain-specific modifier Ssm1 is responsible for the strain-dependent methylation of particular <i>E. coli gpt-</i>containing transgenic sequences. Here, we identify <i>Ssm1</i> as the KRAB-zinc finger (ZF) gene 2610305D13Rik located on distal chromosome 4. <i>Ssm1b</i> is a member of a gene family with an unusual array of three ZFs. Ssm1 family members in C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) mice have various amino acid changes in their ZF domain and in the linker between the KRAB and ZF domains. <i>Ssm1b</i> is expressed up to E8.5; its target transgene gains partial methylation by this stage as well. At E9.5, <i>Ssm1b</i> mRNA is no longer expressed but by then its target has become completely methylated. By contrast, in D2 embryos the transgene is essentially unmethylated. Methylation during B6 embryonic development depends on <i>Dnmt3b</i> but not <i>Mecp2</i>. In differentiating B6 embryonic stem cells methylation spreads from <i>gpt</i> to a co-integrated <i>neo</i> gene that has a similarly high CpG content as <i>gpt</i>, but <i>neo</i> alone is not methylated. In adult B6 mice, <i>Ssm1b</i> is expressed in ovaries, but in other organs only other members of the <i>Ssm1</i> family are expressed. Interestingly, the transgene becomes methylated when crossed into some, but not other, wild mice that were kept outbred in the laboratory. Thus, polymorphisms for the methylation patterns seen among laboratory inbred strains are also found in a free-living population. This may imply that mice that do not have the <i>Ssm1b</i> gene may use another member of the <i>Ssm1</i> family to control the potentially harmful expression of certain endogenous or exogenous genes.</p>

Ventricular Fibrillation Conversion Testing After Implantation of a Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Compared with transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), subcutaneous (S)-ICDs require a higher energy for effective defibrillation. Although ventricular fibrillation conversion testing (CT) is recommended after S-ICD implantation to ensure an adequate margin between the defibrillation threshold and maximum device output (80J), prior work found that adherence to this recommendation is declining.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied first-time recipients of S-ICDs (between September 28, 2012, and April 1, 2016) in the National Cardiovascular Database Registry ICD Registry to determine predictors of use of CT, predictors of an insufficient safety margin (ISM, defined as ventricular fibrillation conversion energy >65J) during testing, and inhospital outcomes associated with use of CT. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to predict use of CT and ISM. Inverse probability weighted logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between use of CT and inhospital adverse events including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>CT testing was performed in 70.7% (n=5624) of 7960 patients with S-ICDs. Although deferral of CT was associated with several patient characteristics (including increased body mass index, increased body surface area, severely reduced ejection fraction, dialysis dependence, warfarin use, anemia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ity effect was comparatively more important (area under the curve for patient level versus generalized linear mixed model: 0.619 versus 0.877). An ISM occurred in 6.9% (n=336) of 4864 patients without a prior ICD and was more common among white patients and those with ventricular pacing on the preimplant ECG, higher preimplant blood pressure, larger body surface area, higher body mass index, and lower ejection fraction. A risk score was able to identify patients at low (<5%), medium (5% to 10%), and high risk (>10%) for ISM. CT testing was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications including death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of CT testing after S-ICD implantation was driven by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ity preference to a greater extent than patient factors and was not associated with a composite of inhospital complications or death.

Quality of Care at Hospitals Identified as Outliers in Publicly Reported Mortality Statistics for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Public reporting of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes may create disincentives for physicians to provide care for critically ill patients, particularly at institutions with worse clinical outcomes. We thus sought to evaluate the procedural management and in-hospital outcomes of patients treated for acute myocardial infarction before and after a hospital had been publicly identified as a negative outlier.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using state reports, we identified hospitals that were recognized as negative PCI outliers in 2 states (Massachusetts and New York) from 2002 to 2012. State hospitalization files were used to identify all patients with an acute myocardial infarction within these states. Procedural management and in-hospital outcomes were compared among patients treated at outlier hospitals before and after public report of outlier status. Patients at nonoutlier institutions were used to control for temporal trends.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 86 hospitals, 31 were reported as outliers for excess mortality. Outlier <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ities were larger, treating more patients with acute myocardial infarction and performing more PCIs than nonoutlier hospitals (<i>P</i><0.05 for each). Among 507 672 patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized at these institutions, 108 428 (21%) were treated at an outlier hospital after public report. The likelihood of PCI at outlier (relative risk [RR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12–1.15) and nonoutlier institutions (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.11–1.14) increased in a similar fashion (interaction <i>P</i>=0.50) after public report of outlier status. The likelihood of in-hospital mortality decreased at outlier institutions (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81–0.85) after public report, and to a lesser degree at nonoutlier institutions (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87–0.92; interaction <i>P</i><0.001). Among patients that underwent PCI, in-hospital mortality decreased at outlier institutions after public recognition of outlier status in comparison with prior (RR, 0.72; 9% CI, 0.66–0.79), a decline that exceeded the reduction at nonoutlier institutions (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96; interaction <i>P</i><0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Large hospitals with higher clinical volume are more likely to be designated as negative outliers.

Reduced Arogenate Dehydratase Expression: Ramifications for Photosynthesis and Metabolism
<p>Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) biosynthesis. Previous work showed that ADT-deficient Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants had significantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger reductions in lines that had deficiencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by analyzing Arabidopsis <i>ADT</i> mutants using our phenomics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">facil</span></strong>ity and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we describe the effects of the modulation of ADT on photosynthetic parameters and secondary metabolism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon flux into Phe biosynthesis in <i>ADT</i> mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron transport rates is caused by an increase in proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane that down-regulates photosystem II activity by the high-energy quenching mechanism. Furthermore, quantitation of secondary metabolites in <i>ADT</i> mutants revealed reduced flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, and glucosinolate contents, including glucosinolates that are not derived from aromatic amino acids, and significantly increased contents of putative galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Additionally, we used real-time atmospheric monitoring mass spectrometry to compare respiration and carbon fixation rates between the wild type and <i>adt3/4/5/6</i>, our most extreme <i>ADT</i> knockout mutant, which revealed no significant difference in both night- and day-adapted plants. Overall, these data reveal the profound effects of altered ADT activity and Phe metabolism on secondary metabolites and photosynthesis with implications for plant improvement.</p>

Acclimation to Fluctuating Light Impacts the Rapidity of Response and Diurnal Rhythm of Stomatal Conductance<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>Plant acclimation to growth light environment has been studied extensively; however, the majority of these studies have focused on light intensity and photo-acclimation, with few studies exploring the impact of dynamic growth light on stomatal acclimation and behavior. To assess the impact of growth light regime on stomatal acclimation, we grew Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in three different lighting regimes (with the same average daily intensity), fluctuating with a fixed pattern of light, fluctuating with a randomized pattern of light (sinusoidal), and nonfluctuating (square wave), to assess the effect of light regime dynamics on gas exchange. We demonstrated that <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> (stomatal conductance to water vapor) acclimation is influenced by both intensity and light pattern, modifying the stomatal kinetics at different times of the day and resulting in differences in the rapidity and magnitude of the <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response. We also describe and quantify the response to an internal signal that uncouples variation in <i>A</i> and <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> over the majority of the diurnal period and represents 25% of the total diurnal <i>g<sub>s</sub></i>. This <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response can be characterized by a Gaussian element and when incorporated into the widely used Ball-Berry model greatly improved the prediction of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in a dynamic environment. From these findings, we conclude that acclimation of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> to growth light could be an important strategy for maintaining carbon fixation and overall plant water status and should be considered when inferring responses in the field from laboratory-based experiments.</p>

Vacuolar Transporters – Companions on a Longtime Journey
<p>Biochemical and electrophysiological studies on plant vacuolar transporters became feasible in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when methods to isolate large quantities of intact vacuoles and purified vacuolar membrane vesicles were established. However, with the exception of the H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and H<sup>+</sup>-PPase, which could be followed due to their hydrolytic activities, attempts to purify tonoplast transporters were for a long time not successful. Heterologous complementation, T-DNA insertion mutants, and later proteomic studies allowed the next steps, starting from the 1990s. Nowadays, our knowledge about vacuolar transporters has increased greatly. Nevertheless, there are several transporters of central importance that have still to be identified at the molecular level or have even not been characterized biochemically. Furthermore, our knowledge about regulation of the vacuolar transporters is very limited, and much work is needed to get a holistic view about the interplay of the vacuolar transportome. The huge amount of information generated during the last 35 years cannot be summarized in such a review. Therefore, I decided to concentrate on some aspects where we were involved during my research on vacuolar transporters, for some our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laboratori</span></strong>es contributed more, while others contributed less.</p>

These antibodies are widely used to identify differences in plant cell wall components in mutants, organ and tissue types, and developmental stages.

Here, we use a plant glycan microarray equipped with 88 synthetic oligosaccharides to comprehensively map the epitopes of plant cell wall glycan-directed antibodies. Our results reveal the binding epitopes for 78 arabinogalactan-, rhamnogalacturonan-, xylan-, and xyloglucan-directed antibodies. We demonstrate that, with knowledge of the exact epitopes recognized by individual antibodies, specific glycosyl hydrolases can be implemented into immunological cell wall analyses, providing a framework to obtain structural information on plant cell wall glycans with unprecedented molecular precision.</p>

Dead or Alive? Using Membrane Failure and Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Fluorescence to Predict Plant Mortality from Drought
<p>Climate models predict widespread increases in both drought intensity and duration in the next decades. Although water deficiency is a significant determinant of plant survival, limited understanding of plant responses to extreme drought impedes forecasts of both forest and crop productivity under increasing aridity. Drought induces a suite of physiological responses; however, we lack an accurate mechanistic description of plant response to lethal drought that would improve predictive understanding of mortality under altered climate conditions. Here, proxies for leaf cellular damage, chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence, and electrolyte leakage were directly associated with failure to recover from drought upon rewatering in <i>Brassica</i> <i>rapa</i> (genotype R500) and thus define the exact timing of drought-induced death. We validated our results using a second genotype (imb211) that differs substantially in life history traits. Our study demonstrates that whereas changes in carbon dynamics and water transport are critical indicators of drought stress, they can be unrelated to visible metrics of mortality, i.e. lack of meristematic activity and regrowth. In contrast, membrane failure at the cellular scale is the most proximate cause of death. This hypothesis was corroborated in two gymnosperms (<i>Picea engelmannii</i> and <i>Pinus contorta</i>) that experienced lethal water stress in the field and in laboratory conditions. We suggest that measurement of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence can be used to operationally define plant death arising from drought, and improved plant characterization can enhance surface model predictions of drought mortality and its consequences to ecosystem services at a global scale.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid measurements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were measured with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside measurements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a measure of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical absorbance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for measured and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional measurements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

Paternal Mitochondrial Transmission in Intra-Species <i>Caenorhabditis briggsae</i> Hybrids
<p>To study mitochondrial–nuclear genetic interactions in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis briggsae</i>, our three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laboratori</span></strong>es independently created 38 intra-species cytoplasmic–nuclear hybrid (cybrid) lines. Although the cross design combines maternal mitotypes with paternal nuclear genotypes, eight lines (21%) unexpectedly contained paternal mitotypes. All eight share in common ancestry of one of two genetically related strains. This unexpected parallel observation of paternal mitochondrial transmission, undesirable given our intent of creating cybrids, provides a serendipitous experimental model and framework to study the molecular and evolutionary basis of uniparental mitochondrial inheritance.</p>

High basal metabolic rate does not elevate oxidative stress during reproduction in laboratory mice
<p>Increased oxidative stress (OS) has been suggested as a physiological cost of reproduction. However, previous studies reported ambiguous results, with some even showing a reduction of oxidative damage during reproduction. We tested whether the link between reproduction and OS is mediated by basal metabolic rate (BMR), which has been hypothesized to affect both the rate of radical oxygen species production and antioxidative capacity. We studied the effect of reproduction on OS in females of laboratory mice divergently selected for high (H-BMR) and low (L-BMR) BMR, previously shown to differ with respect to parental investment. Non-reproducing L-BMR females showed higher oxidative damage to lipids (quantified as the level of malondialdehyde in internal organ tissues) and DNA (quantified as the level of 8-oxodG in blood serum) than H-BMR females. Reproduction did not affect oxidative damage to lipids in either line; however, it reduced damage to DNA in L-BMR females. Reproduction increased catalase activity in liver (significantly stronger in L-BMR females) and decreased it in kidneys. We conclude that the effect of reproduction on OS depends on the initial variation in BMR and varies between studied internal organs and markers of OS.</p>

Thermal tolerance breadths among groundwater crustaceans living in a thermally constant environment
<p>The climate variability hypothesis assumes that the thermal tolerance breadth of a species is primarily determined by temperature variations experienced in its environment. If so, aquatic invertebrates living in thermally buffered environments would be expected to exhibit narrow thermal tolerance breadths (stenothermy). We tested this prediction by studying the thermal physiology of three isopods (Asellidae, <i>Proasellus</i>) colonizing groundwater habitats characterized by an annual temperature amplitude of less than 1°C. The species responses to temperature variation were assessed in the laboratory using five physiological variables: survival, locomotor activity, aerobic respiration, immune defense and concentrations of total free amino acids and sugars. The three species exhibited contrasted thermal physiologies, although all variables were not equally informative. In accordance with the climate variability hypothesis, two species were extremely sensitive even to moderate changes in temperature (2°C) below and above their habitat temperature. In contrast, the third species exhibited a surprisingly high thermal tolerance breadth (11°C). Differences in response to temperature variation among <i>Proasellus</i> species indicated that their thermal physiology was not solely shaped by the current temperature seasonality in their natural habitats. More particularly, recent gene flow among populations living in thermally constant yet contrasted habitats might explain the occurrence of eurytherm species in thermally buffered environments.</p>

Does tantalum exhibit any intrinsic antimicrobial or antibiofilm properties?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tantalum (Ta) trabecular metal components are increasingly used   to reconstruct major bone defects in revision arthroplasty surgery.   It is known that some metals such as silver have antibacterial properties.   Recent reports have raised the question regarding whether Ta components   are protective against infection in revision surgery. This laboratory   study aimed to establish whether Ta has intrinsic antibacterial   properties against planktonic bacteria, or the ability to inhibit   biofilm formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Equal-sized pieces of Ta and titanium (Ti) acetabular components   were sterilised and incubated with a low dose inoculum of either <i>Staphylococcus   (S.) aureus</i> or <i>S. epidermidis</i> for 24 hours.   After serial dilution, colony forming units (cfu) were quantified   on Mueller-Hinton agar plates. In order to establish whether biofilms   formed to a greater extent on one material than the other, these   Ta and Ti pieces were then washed twice, sonicated and washed again   to remove loosely adhered planktonic bacteria. They were then re-incubated   for 24 hours prior to quantifying the number of cfu. All experiments   were performed in triplicate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>More than 1x10<sup>8</sup> cfu/ml were observed in both the Ta   and Ti experiments. After washing and sonication, more than 2x10<sup>7</sup> cfu/ml   were observed for both Ta and Ti groups. The results were the same   for both <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>S. epidermidis</i>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Compared with Ti controls, Ta did not demonstrate any intrinsic   antibacterial activity or ability to inhibit biofilm formation.   Hence, intrinsic antimicrobial properties of Ta do not account for   the previously observed reduction in the frequency of subsequent   infections when Ta was used in revision procedures. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1153–6.</p></sec>

Assessment of resuscitation as measured by markers of metabolic acidosis and features of injury
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The best time for definitive orthopaedic care is often unclear   in patients with multiple injuries. The objective of this study   was make a prospective assessment of the safety of our early appropriate   care (EAC) strategy and to evaluate the potential benefit of additional   laboratory data to determine readiness for surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A cohort of 335 patients with fractures of the pelvis, acetabulum,   femur, or spine were included. Patients underwent definitive fixation   within 36 hours if one of the following three parameters were met:   lactate < 4.0 mmol/L; pH ≥ 7.25; or base excess (BE) ≥ -5.5 mmol/L.   If all three parameters were met, resuscitation was designated full   protocol resuscitation (FPR). If less than all three parameters   were met, it was designated an incomplete protocol resuscitation   (IPR). Complications were assessed by an independent adjudication   committee and included infection; sepsis; PE/DVT; organ failure;   pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In total, 66 patients (19.7%) developed 90 complications. An   historical cohort of 1441 patients had a complication rate of 22.1%.   The complication rate for patients with only one EAC parameter at   the point of protocol was 34.3%, which was higher than other groups   (p = 0.041). Patients who had IPR did not have significantly more   complications (31.8%) than those who had FPR (22.6%; p = 0.078).   Regression analysis showed male gender and injury severity score   to be independent predictors of complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights important trends in the IPR and FPR groups,   suggesting that differences in resuscitation parameters may guide   care in certain patients; further study is, however, required.

‘Hot Joints’ infection protocol reduces unnecessary post-operative re-admissions following total hip and knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of an institutionally developed   algorithm for evaluation and diagnosis of prosthetic joint injection   and to determine the impact of this protocol on overall hospital   re-admissions.p</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively evaluated 2685 total hip arthroplasty (THA)   and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients prior to (1263) and following   (1422) the introduction of an infection detection protocol. The   protocol used conservative thresholds for C-reactive protein to   direct the medical attendant to aspirate the joint. The protocol   incorporated a clear set of laboratory and clinical criteria that   allowed a patient to be discharged home if all were met. Patients were   included if they presented to our emergency department within 120   days post-operatively with concerns for swelling, pain or infection   and were excluded if they had an unambiguous infection or if their   chief complaint was non-orthopaedic in nature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Concern for infection was the single most common (32%) reason   for presentation. A total of 296 patients made an emergency visit   and were included following THA or TKA. In the pre-protocol cohort,   11 of 27 patients were formally re-admitted to the hospital with   concern for infection but only five (45%) patients had actual infections   and received additional treatment. In comparison, in the post-protocol   cohort, 11 patients were admitted for suspected infection, nine   (82%) of whom were truly infected (p = 0.04).

Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis in the United Kingdom
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) infection of bones and joints accounts for   6.7% of TB cases in England, and is associated with significant   morbidity and disability. Public Health England reports that patients   with TB experience delays in diagnosis and treatment. Our aims were   to determine the demographics, presentation and investigation of   patients with a TB infection of bones and joints, to help doctors   assessing potential cases and to identify avoidable delays.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective observational study of all adults with   positive TB cultures on specimens taken at a tertiary orthopaedic   centre between June 2012 and May 2014. A laboratory information   system search identified the patients. The demographics, clinical presentation,   radiology, histopathology and key clinical dates were obtained from   medical records.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 31 adult patients were identified. Their median age   was 37 years (interquartile range (IQR): 29 to 53); 21 (68%) were   male; 89% were migrants. The main sites affected were joints (10,   32%), the spine (8, 26%) and long bones (6, 19%); 8 (26%) had multifocal   disease. The most common presenting symptoms were pain (29/31, 94%)   and swelling (26/28, 93%). ‘Typical’ symptoms of TB, such as fever,   sweats and weight loss, were uncommon. Patients waited a median   of seven months (IQR 3 to 13.5) between the onset of symptoms and referral   to the tertiary centre and 2.3 months (IQR 1.6 to 3.4.)) between   referral and starting treatment. Radiology suggested TB in 26 (84%),   but in seven patients (23%) the initial biopsy specimens were not   sent for mycobacterial culture, necessitating a second biopsy. Rapid   Polymerase Chain Reaction-based testing for TB using Xpert MTB/RIF   was performed in five patients; 4 (80%) tested positive for TB.   These patients had a reduced time between the diagnostic biopsy and   starting treatment than those whose samples were not tested (median   eight days <i>versus</i> 36 days, p = 0.016).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with bone and joint TB experience delays in diagnosis   and treatment, some of which are avoidable. Maintaining a high index   of clinical suspicion and sending specimens for mycobacterial culture   are crucial to avoid missing cases.

Absence of strong strain effects in behavioral analyses of <i>Shank3</i>-deficient mice
<p>Haploinsufficiency of <i>SHANK3</i>, caused by chromosomal abnormalities or mutations that disrupt one copy of the gene, leads to a neurodevelopmental syndrome called Phelan-McDermid syndrome, symptoms of which can include absent or delayed speech, intellectual disability, neurological changes and autism spectrum disorders. The SHANK3 protein forms a key structural part of the post-synaptic density. We previously generated and characterized mice with a targeted disruption of <i>Shank3</i> in which exons coding for the ankyrin-repeat domain were deleted and expression of full-length Shank3 was disrupted. We documented specific deficits in synaptic function and plasticity, along with reduced reciprocal social interactions, in <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous mice. Changes in phenotype owing to a mutation at a single locus are quite frequently modulated by other loci, most dramatically when the entire genetic background is changed. In mice, each strain of laboratory mouse represents a distinct genetic background and alterations in phenotype owing to gene knockout or transgenesis are frequently different across strains, which can lead to the identification of important modifier loci. We have investigated the effect of genetic background on phenotypes of <i>Shank3</i> heterozygous, knockout and wild-type mice, using C57BL/6, 129SVE and FVB/Ntac strain backgrounds. We focused on observable behaviors with the goal of carrying out subsequent analyses to identify modifier loci. Surprisingly, there were very modest strain effects over a large battery of analyses. These results indicate that behavioral phenotypes associated with <i>Shank3</i> haploinsufficiency are largely strain-independent.</p>

Hemodynamic and Echocardiographic Comparison of the Lotus and CoreValve Transcatheter Aortic Valves in Patients With High and Extreme Surgical Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Comparative echocardiographic data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems from randomized trials are limited. The REPRISE III trial (Repositionable Percutaneous Replacement of Stenotic Aortic Valve through Implantation of Lotus Valve System – Randomized Clinical Evaluation) is a multicenter, randomized comparison of a mechanically expanded (Lotus) versus self-expanding (CoreValve) transcatheter aortic valve replacement device. This analysis rigorously assesses Doppler-derived valve hemodynamics and the impact on outcomes at 1 year in patients with extreme/high surgical risk treated with Lotus and CoreValve from REPRISE III.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>REPRISE III includes patients with extreme- and high-risk aortic stenosis. Patients were enrolled at 55 centers. All transthoracic echocardiograms with Doppler were obtained following a standard protocol up to 12 months postimplant and analyzed by a core laboratory. Valve size, mean gradient, aortic valve area, and Doppler velocity index and their impact on clinical outcomes are reported. Additional parameters including paravalvular leak were evaluated using a multiparametric approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 912 patients were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio; 607 Lotus:305 CoreValve). Median age was 84 years, 51% of the patients were women, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 6.8±4.1. CoreValve demonstrated lower gradients and larger aortic valve area and Doppler velocity index than Lotus at discharge; the difference decreased in subsequent follow-up up to a year (all <i>P</i><0.01). Lotus had lower rates of paravalvular leak that persisted over time (<i>P</i><0.05). Similar outcomes were seen when comparing each valve type by size group (small, medium, large). The hemodynamic differences between valves did not translate into worse clinical outcomes. All-cause mortality was not different between the 2 groups in any of the 3 valve sizes. When comparing patients with normal valve gradients (<20 mm Hg, n=780) with those with abnormal gradients (>20 mm Hg, n=48) in the entire patient population, all-cause mortality was not different. This was also not significant when evaluating each valve type separately. Similarly, there were no differences for aortic valve area >1.1 cm<sup>2</sup> or <1.1 cm<sup>2</sup> and for Doppler velocity index >0.35 or <0.35 (all <i>P</i>=not significant).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Lotus had significantly greater freedom from moderate or severe paravalvular leak and smaller valve area and higher gradients than CoreValve. The hemodynamic differences were not associated with any clinical differences in the composite end point of mortality, disabling stroke, and moderate paravalvular leak or with quality of life at 1 year of follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Carotid Stent Fractures Are Not Associated With Adverse Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The impact of carotid artery stent fractures on the incidence of adverse clinical events remains unclear. The objective of this study is to report the stent fracture rate and its association with in-stent restenosis and adverse outcomes in the ACT-1 trial (Carotid Angioplasty and Stenting Versus Endarterectomy in Asymptomatic Subjects Who Are at Standard Risk for Carotid Endarterectomy With Significant Extracranial Carotid Stenotic Disease).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>ACT-1 is a prospective multicenter trial of patients who have standard surgical risk with severe asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis randomly assigned to carotid artery stenting or carotid endarterectomy (Abbott Vascular). The primary end point was a composite of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction during the 30 days after the procedure or ipsilateral stroke during the 365 days after the procedure. After 771 patients were enrolled, successively randomly assigned patients were required to undergo annual radiographic (x-ray) analysis for stent fracture. Images were independently adjudicated by a core laboratory.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 1021 patients treated with carotid artery stenting during a mean follow-up of 3.1±1.6 years, 939 had at least 1 x-ray during the follow-up period. Stent fracture was reported in 51 (5.4%) patients. With a maximum follow-up period of 5 years, adverse clinical outcomes occurred in 39 patients with at least 1 x-ray during the follow-up. Of 826 (80.9%) subjects who underwent both duplex ultrasound and x-ray, 822 (99.5%) were interpretable. There was no association between stent fracture and the primary end point (<i>P</i>=0.86) or with restenosis (<i>P</i>=0.53).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this large, independently adjudicated, multicenter study, the stent fracture rate was low and not associated with major adverse clinical events or in-stent restenosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Mortality and Cerebrovascular Events After Heart Rhythm Disorder Management Procedures
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recognition of rates and causes of hard, patient-centered outcomes of death and cerebrovascular events (CVEs) after heart rhythm disorder management (HRDM) procedures is an essential step for the development of quality improvement programs in electrophysiology <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">laboratori</span></strong>es. Our primary aim was to assess and characterize death and CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic attack) after HRDM procedures over a 17-year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients undergoing HRDM procedures between January 2000 and November 2016 at the Mayo Clinic. Patients from all 3 tertiary academic centers (Rochester, Phoenix, and Jacksonville) were included in the study. All in-hospital deaths and CVEs after HRDM procedures were identified and were further characterized as directly or indirectly related to the HRDM procedure. Subgroup analysis of death and CVE rates was performed for ablation, device implantation, electrophysiology study, lead extraction, and defibrillation threshold testing procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 48 913 patients (age, 65.7±6.6 years; 64% male) who underwent a total of 62 065 HRDM procedures were included in the study. The overall mortality and CVE rates in the cohort were 0.36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.42) and 0.12% (95% CI, 0.09–0.16), respectively. Patients undergoing lead extraction had the highest overall mortality rate at 1.9% (95% CI, 1.34–2.61) and CVE rate at 0.62% (95% CI, 0.32–1.07). Among patients undergoing HRDM procedures, 48% of deaths directly related to the HDRM procedure were among patients undergoing device implantation procedures. Overall, cardiac tamponade was the most frequent direct cause of death (40%), and infection was the most common indirect cause of death (29%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 0.76%, with the highest being in lead extraction procedures (3.08%), followed by device implantation procedures (0.94%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Half of the deaths directly related to an HRDM procedure were among the patients undergoing device implantation procedures, with cardiac tamponade being the most common cause of death. This highlights the importance of the development of protocols for the quick identification and management of cardiac tamponade even in procedures typically believed to be lower risk such as device implantation.</p></sec>

Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) estimation. The novel method of LDL-C estimation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical cut points. For low estimated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we evaluated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald estimation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel estimation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald estimation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C estimation performs better in nonfasting samples than the fixed Friedewald estimation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides. In addition to stimulating further study, these results may have immediate relevance for guideline committees, laboratory leadership, clinicians, and patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Association Between Diastolic Blood Pressure During Pediatric In-Hospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Survival
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>On the basis of laboratory cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) investigations and limited adult data demonstrating that survival depends on attaining adequate arterial diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during CPR, the American Heart Association recommends using blood pressure to guide pediatric CPR. However, evidence-based blood pressure targets during pediatric CPR remain an important knowledge gap for CPR guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>All children ≥37 weeks’ gestation and <19 years old in Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network intensive care units with chest compressions for ≥1 minute and invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring before and during CPR between July 1, 2013, and June 31, 2016, were included. Mean DBP during CPR and Utstein-style standardized cardiac arrest data were collected. The hypothesis was that DBP ≥25 mm Hg during CPR in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old would be associated with survival. Primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcome was survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurological outcome, defined as Pediatric Cerebral Performance Categories 1 to 3 or no worse than prearrest baseline. Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error estimates were used to estimate the relative risk of outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Blinded investigators analyzed blood pressure waveforms during CPR from 164 children, including 60% <1 year old, 60% with congenital heart disease, and 54% after cardiac surgery. The immediate cause of arrest was hypotension in 67%, respiratory decompensation in 44%, and arrhythmia in 19%. Median duration of CPR was 8 minutes (quartiles, 3 and 27 minutes). Ninety percent survived the event, 68% with return of spontaneous circulation and 22% by extracorporeal life support. Forty-seven percent survived to hospital discharge, and 43% survived to discharge with favorable neurological outcome. Maintaining mean DBP ≥25 mm Hg in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old occurred in 101 of 164 children (62%) and was associated with survival (adjusted relative risk, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–2.6; <i>P</i>=0.007) and survival with favorable neurological outcome (adjusted relative risk, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–2.5; <i>P</i>=0.02).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data demonstrate that mean DBP ≥25 mm Hg during CPR in infants and ≥30 mm Hg in children ≥1 year old was associated with greater likelihood of survival to hospital discharge and survival with favorable neurological outcome.</p></sec>

High-Density Lipoprotein Subspecies Defined by Presence of Apolipoprotein C-III and Incident Coronary Heart Disease in Four Cohorts
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The causal role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in cardioprotection has been questioned by genetic and randomized studies. Novel measures that relate to HDL function may contribute new information to the prediction of cardiovascular risk. Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is a key regulator of lipoprotein metabolism. We investigated whether subspecies of HDL defined by apoC-III are associated with coronary heart disease (CHD).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used immunoaffinity chromatography to measure the apoA-I concentrations of HDL that contains and lacks apoC-III in 2 prospective studies of adults free of CHD. In MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), 5657 participants (52% women, 52–72 years of age) were followed for risk of CHD from 2000 to 2002 through 2013. In a case-cohort study nested within the DCH study (Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health), 3642 participants (47% women, 51–64 years of age) were followed from 1994 to 1997 through 2010. Subsequently, we conducted a meta-analysis that combined these results with the previously published findings from 2 cohort studies that used similar laboratory methodology to measure lipoproteins, totaling 2997 incident cases.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>ApoC-III was found on 6% to 8% of apoA-I. The 2 HDL subspecies showed opposing associations, with risk of CHD in each of the individual cohorts and in the meta-analysis (<i>P</i> heterogeneity between the 2 subspecies <0.01). HDL that contains apoC-III was associated with a higher risk of CHD (pooled relative risk per standard deviation, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.18), whereas HDL that lacks apoC-III was associated with lower risk (relative risk, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–0.83). The relative risk for HDL lacking apoC-III was even more negative than the relative risk for total HDL (relative risk, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.87).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings from 4 prospective studies support the hypothesis that apoC-III may mark a subfraction of HDL that is associated with higher risk of CHD. New measures reflecting HDL structure and function may provide novel insights for cardiovascular risk that extend beyond traditional plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations.</p></sec>

Physiology of Angina and Its Alleviation With Nitroglycerin
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The mechanisms governing exercise-induced angina and its alleviation by the most commonly used antianginal drug, nitroglycerin, are incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to develop a method by which the effects of antianginal drugs could be evaluated invasively during physiological exercise to gain further understanding of the clinical impact of angina and nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Forty patients (mean age, 65.2±7.6 years) with exertional angina and coronary artery disease underwent cardiac catheterization via radial access and performed incremental exercise using a supine cycle ergometer. As they developed limiting angina, sublingual nitroglycerin was administered to half the patients, and all patients continued to exercise for 2 minutes at the same workload. Throughout exercise, distal coronary pressure and flow velocity and central aortic pressure were recorded with sensor wires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients continued to exercise after nitroglycerin administration with less ST-segment depression (<i>P</i>=0.003) and therefore myocardial ischemia. Significant reductions in afterload (aortic pressure, <i>P</i>=0.030) and myocardial oxygen demand were seen (tension-time index, <i>P</i>=0.024; rate-pressure product, <i>P</i>=0.046), as well as an increase in myocardial oxygen supply (Buckberg index, <i>P</i>=0.017). Exercise reduced peripheral arterial wave reflection (<i>P</i><0.05), which was not further augmented by the administration of nitroglycerin (<i>P</i>=0.648). The observed increases in coronary pressure gradient, stenosis resistance, and flow velocity did not reach statistical significance; however, the diastolic velocity–pressure gradient relation was consistent with a significant increase in relative stenosis severity (k coefficient, <i>P</i><0.0001), in keeping with exercise-induced vasoconstriction of stenosed epicardial segments and dilatation of normal segments, with trends toward reversal with nitroglycerin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The catheterization laboratory protocol provides a model to study myocardial ischemia and the actions of novel and established antianginal drugs. Administration of nitroglycerin causes changes in the systemic and coronary circulation that combine to reduce myocardial oxygen demand and to increase supply, thereby attenuating exercise-induced ischemia. Designing antianginal therapies that exploit these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic strategies.</p></sec>

Optical Coherence Tomography Findings in Patients With Coronary Stent Thrombosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Stent thrombosis (ST) is a serious complication following coronary stenting. Intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) may provide insights into mechanistic processes leading to ST. We performed a prospective, multicenter study to evaluate OCT findings in patients with ST.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Consecutive patients presenting with ST were prospectively enrolled in a registry by using a centralized telephone registration system. After angiographic confirmation of ST, OCT imaging of the culprit vessel was performed with frequency domain OCT. Clinical data were collected according to a standardized protocol. OCT acquisitions were analyzed at a core laboratory. Dominant and contributing findings were adjudicated by an imaging adjudication committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Two hundred thirty-one patients presenting with ST underwent OCT imaging; 14 (6.1%) had image quality precluding further analysis. Of the remaining patients, 62 (28.6%) and 155 (71.4%) presented with early and late/very late ST, respectively. The underlying stent type was a new-generation drug-eluting stent in 50.3%. Mean reference vessel diameter was 2.9±0.6 mm and mean reference vessel area was 6.8±2.6 mm<sup>2</sup>. Stent underexpansion (stent expansion index <0.8) was observed in 44.4% of patients. The predicted average probability (95% confidence interval) that any frame had uncovered (or thrombus-covered) struts was 99.3% (96.1–99.9), 96.6% (92.4–98.5), 34.3% (15.0–60.7), and 9.6% (6.2–14.5) and malapposed struts was 21.8% (8.4–45.6), 8.5% (4.6–15.3), 6.7% (2.5–16.3), and 2.0% (1.2–3.3) for acute, subacute, late, and very late ST, respectively. The most common dominant finding adjudicated for acute ST was uncovered struts (66.7% of cases); for subacute ST, the most common dominant finding was uncovered struts (61.7%) and underexpansion (25.5%); for late ST, the most common dominant finding was uncovered struts (33.3%) and severe restenosis (19.1%); and for very late ST, the most common dominant finding was neoatherosclerosis (31.3%) and uncovered struts (20.2%). In patients presenting very late ST, uncovered stent struts were a common dominant finding in drug-eluting stents, and neoatherosclerosis was a common dominant finding in bare metal stents.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In patients with ST, uncovered and malapposed struts were frequently observed with the incidence of both decreasing with longer time intervals between stent implantation and presentation. The most frequent dominant observation varied according to time intervals from index stenting: uncovered struts and underexpansion in acute/subacute ST and neoatherosclerosis and uncovered struts in late/very late ST.</p></sec>

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Evolocumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9), markedly reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol across diverse patient populations. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of evolocumab in a pooled safety analysis from phase 2 or 3 randomized and placebo or comparator-controlled trials (integrated parent trials) and the first year of open-label extension (OLE) trials that included a standard-of-care control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This analysis included adverse event (AE) data from 6026 patients in 12 phase 2 and 3 parent trials, with a median exposure of 2.8 months, and, of those patients, from 4465 patients who continued with a median follow-up of 11.1 months in 2 OLE trials. AEs were analyzed separately for the parent and OLE trials. Overall AE rates, serious AEs, laboratory assessments, and AEs of interest were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Overall AE rates were similar between evolocumab and control in the parent trials (51.1% versus 49.6%) and in year 1 of OLE trials (70.0% versus 66.0%), as were those for serious AEs. Elevations of serum transaminases, bilirubin, and creatine kinase were infrequent and similar between groups. Muscle-related AEs were similar between evolocumab and control. Neurocognitive AEs were infrequent and balanced during the double-blind parent studies (5 events [0.1%], evolocumab groups versus 6 events [0.3%], control groups). In the OLE trials, 27 patients (0.9%) in the evolocumab groups and 5 patients (0.3%) in the control groups reported neurocognitive AEs. No neutralizing antievolocumab antibodies were detected.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Overall, this integrated safety analysis of 6026 patients pooled across phase 2/3 trials and 4465 patients who continued in OLE trials for 1 year supports a favorable benefit-risk profile for evolocumab.</p></sec>

We aimed to investigate survival and predictors of death in a large, contemporary cohort of Eisenmenger syndrome patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In a multicenter approach, we identified adults with Eisenmenger syndrome under follow-up between 2000 and 2015. We examined survival and its association with clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and laboratory parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We studied 1098 patients (median age, 34.4 years; range, 16.1–84.4 years; 65.1% female; 31.9% with Down syndrome). The majority had a posttricuspid defect (n=643, 58.6%), followed by patients with a complex (n=315, 28.7%) and pretricuspid lesion (n=140, 12.7%). Over a median follow-up of 3.1 years (interquartile range, 1.4–5.9), allowing for 4361.6 patient-years observation, 278 patients died and 6 underwent transplantation. Twelve parameters emerged as significant predictors of death on univariable analysis. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, only age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.41/10 years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24–1.59; <i>P</i><0.001), pretricuspid shunt (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.02–2.39; <i>P</i>=0.041), oxygen saturation at rest (HR, 0.53/10%; 95% CI, 0.43–0.65; <i>P</i><0.001), presence of sinus rhythm (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32–0.88; <i>P</i>=0.013), and presence of pericardial effusion (HR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.59–3.66; <i>P</i><0.001) remained significant predictors of death.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>There is significant premature mortality among contemporary adults with Eisenmenger syndrome. We report, herewith, a multivariable mortality risk stratification model based on 5 simple, noninvasive predictors of death in this population.</p></sec>

Compacted dimensions and singular plasmonic surfaces
<p>In advanced field theories, there can be more than four <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions to space, the excess <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions described as compacted and unobservable on everyday length scales. We report a simple model, unconnected to field theory, for a compacted <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ion realized in a metallic metasurface periodically structured in the form of a grating comprising a series of singularities. An extra <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ion of the grating is hidden, and the surface plasmon excitations, though localized at the surface, are characterized by three wave vectors rather than the two of typical two-<strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ional metal grating.

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency stability, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the damping). We show that the frequency stability of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>s, notably, increased damping leads to better stability and sensor resolution, with improvement proportional to damping. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature resolution of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>. These results open the door to high-performance ultrasensitive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator stability.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of system, having <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding systems in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in systems where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a system becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant systems, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-<strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> performance.</p>

The strength of long-range ties in population-scale social networks
<p>Long-range connections that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> large social networks are widely assumed to be weak, composed of sporadic and emotionally distant relationships. However, researchers historically have lacked the population-scale network data needed to verify the predicted weakness. Using data from 11 culturally diverse population-scale networks on four continents—encompassing 56 million Twitter users and 58 million mobile phone subscribers—we find that long-range ties are nearly as strong as social ties embedded within a small circle of friends. These high-<strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> connections have important implications for diffusion and social integration.</p>

Fractal-like hierarchical organization of bone begins at the nanoscale
<p>The components of bone assemble hierarchically to provide stiffness and toughness. However, the organization and relationship between bone’s principal components—mineral and collagen—has not been clearly elucidated. Using three-<strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ional electron tomography imaging and high-resolution two-<strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ional electron microscopy, we demonstrate that bone mineral is hierarchically assembled beginning at the nanoscale: Needle-shaped mineral units merge laterally to form platelets, and these are further organized into stacks of roughly parallel platelets. These stacks coalesce into aggregates that exceed the lateral <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions of the collagen fibrils and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> adjacent fibrils as continuous, cross-fibrillar mineralization. On the basis of these observations, we present a structural model of hierarchy and continuity for the mineral phase, which contributes to the structural integrity of bone.</p>

Accurate computational design of multipass transmembrane proteins
<p>The computational design of transmembrane proteins with more than one membrane-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ning region remains a major challenge. We report the design of transmembrane monomers, homodimers, trimers, and tetramers with 76 to 215 residue subunits containing two to four membrane-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ning regions and up to 860 total residues that adopt the target oligomerization state in detergent solution. The designed proteins localize to the plasma membrane in bacteria and in mammalian cells, and magnetic tweezer unfolding experiments in the membrane indicate that they are very stable. Crystal structures of the designed dimer and tetramer—a rocket-shaped structure with a wide cytoplasmic base that funnels into eight transmembrane helices—are very close to the design models. Our results pave the way for the design of multi<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> membrane proteins with new functions.</p>

Learning and attention reveal a general relationship between population activity and behavior
<p>Prior studies have demonstrated that correlated variability changes with cognitive processes that improve perceptual performance. We tested whether correlated variability covaries with subjects’ performance—whether performance improves quickly with attention or slowly with perceptual learning. We found a single, consistent relationship between correlated variability and behavioral performance, regardless of the time frame of correlated variability change. This correlated variability was oriented along the <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions in population space used by the animal on a trial-by-trial basis to make decisions.

Revealing the subfemtosecond dynamics of orbital angular momentum in nanoplasmonic vortices
<p>The ability of light to carry and deliver orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the form of optical vortices has attracted much interest. The physical properties of light with a helical wavefront can be confined onto two-<strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ional surfaces with subwavelength <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions in the form of plasmonic vortices, opening avenues for thus far unknown light-matter interactions. Because of their extreme rotational velocity, the ultrafast dynamics of such vortices remained unexplored. Here we show the detailed spatiotemporal evolution of nanovortices using time-resolved two-photon photoemission electron microscopy. We observe both long- and short-range plasmonic vortices confined to deep subwavelength <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions on the scale of 100 nanometers with nanometer spatial resolution and subfemtosecond time-step resolution. Finally, by measuring the angular velocity of the vortex, we directly extract the OAM magnitude of light.</p>

Spontaneous Mutation Accumulation in <i>Daphnia pulex</i> in Selection-Free vs. Competitive Environments
<p>Understanding the rates, spectra, and fitness effects of spontaneous mutations is fundamental to answering key questions in evolution, molecular biology, disease genetics, and conservation biology. To estimate mutation rates and evaluate the effect of selection on new mutations, we propagated mutation accumulation (MA) lines of <i>Daphnia pulex</i> for more than 82 generations and maintained a non-MA population under conditions where selection could act. Both experiments were started with the same obligate asexual progenitor clone. By sequencing 30 genomes and implementing a series of validation steps that informed the bioinformatic analyses, we identified a total of 477 single nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in the MA lines, corresponding to a mutation rate of 2.30 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (95% CI 1.90–2.70 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) per nucleotide per generation. The high overall rate of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 4.82 × 10<sup>−5</sup> per site per generation was due to a large ameiotic recombination event <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ning an entire arm of a chromosome (∼6 Mb) and several hemizygous deletion events <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ning ∼2 kb each. In the non-MA population, we found significantly fewer mutations than expected based on the rate derived from the MA experiment, indicating purifying selection was likely acting to remove new deleterious mutations. We observed a surprisingly high level of genetic variability in the non-MA population, which we propose to be driven by balancing selection. Our findings suggest that both positive and negative selection on new mutations is powerful and effective in a strictly clonal population.</p>

Quantification of the ossification of the lateral cuneiform in the feet of young children with unilateral congenital talipes equinovarus
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>After the initial correction of congenital talipes equinovarus   (CTEV) using the Ponseti method, a subsequent dynamic deformity   is often managed by transfer of the tendon of tibialis anterior   (TATT) to the lateral cuneiform.

Physiological Right Ventricular Adaptation in Elite Athletes of African and Afro-Caribbean Origin
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Regular, intensive exercise results in physiological biventricular cardiac adaptation. Ethnicity is an established determinant of left ventricular remodeling; black athletes (BAs) exhibit more profound LV hypertrophy than white athletes (WAs). Right ventricular (RV) remodeling has not been characterized in BAs, although the issue is pertinent because BAs commonly exhibit ECG anomalies that resemble arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Between 2006 and 2012, 300 consecutive BAs (n=243 males) from 25 sporting disciplines were evaluated by use of ECG and echocardiography. Results were compared with 375 WAs and 153 sedentary control subjects (n=69 blacks). There were no ethnic differences between RV parameters in control subjects. Both BAs and WAs exhibited greater RV <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions than control subjects. RV <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions were marginally smaller in BAs than in WAs (proximal outflow tract, 30.9±5.5 versus 32.8±5.3 mm, <i>P</i><0.001; longitudinal <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ion, 86.6±9.5 versus 89.8±9.6 mm, <i>P</i><0.001), although only 2.3% of variation was attributable to ethnicity. RV enlargement compatible with diagnostic criteria for arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy was frequently observed (proximal outflow tract ≥32 mm; 45.0% of BAs, 58.5% of WAs). Anterior T-wave inversion was present in 14.3% of BAs versus 3.7% of WAs (<i>P</i><0.001).

The impact of ethnicity is minimal, which obviates the need for race-specific RV reference values. However, in the context of frequent ECG repolarization anomalies in BAs, the potential for erroneous diagnosis of arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy is considerably greater in this ethnic group.</p></sec>

Late Outcomes of Mitral Valve Repair for Mitral Regurgitation Due to Degenerative Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The pathological spectrum of degenerative diseases of the mitral valve (MV) that causes mitral regurgitation (MR) is broad, and there is limited information on late outcomes of MV repair in various subgroups of patients and pathologies. This study examines this issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>All 840 patients who had MV repair for MR due to degenerative diseases from 1985 to 2004 were prospectively followed with clinical and echocardiographic evaluations at biennial intervals up to 26 years, median of 10.4 years. Clinical, hemodynamic, and pathological variables were evaluated for their association with outcomes. Age, left ventricular ejection fraction, and functional class were predictors of late cardiac- and valve-related deaths by multivariable analysis. MV repair failed to restore life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> to normal in patients with functional class IV. Thirty-eight patients had repeat MV surgery, and the probability of reoperation at 20 years was 5.9%. During the follow-up, recurrent severe MR developed in 37 patients, and moderate MR developed in 61. Age, isolated prolapse of the anterior leaflet, the degree of myxomatous changes in the MV, lack of mitral annuloplasty, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass were associated with increased risk of recurrent MR.

Solving the quantum many-body problem with artificial neural networks
<p>The challenge posed by the many-body problem in quantum physics originates from the difficulty of describing the nontrivial correlations encoded in the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function. Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with a variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme we demonstrate is capable of both finding the ground state and describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems. Our approach achieves high accuracy in describing prototypical interacting spins models in one and two <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions.</p>

Evolutionary drivers of thermoadaptation in enzyme catalysis
<p>With early life likely to have existed in a hot environment, enzymes had to cope with an inherent drop in catalytic speed caused by lowered temperature. Here we characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying thermoadaptation of enzyme catalysis in adenylate kinase using ancestral sequence reconstruction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ning 3 billion years of evolution. We show that evolution solved the enzyme’s key kinetic obstacle—how to maintain catalytic speed on a cooler Earth—by exploiting transition-state heat capacity. Tracing the evolution of enzyme activity and stability from the hot-start toward modern hyperthermophilic, mesophilic, and psychrophilic organisms illustrates active pressure versus passive drift in evolution on a molecular level, refutes the debated activity/stability trade-off, and suggests that the catalytic speed of adenylate kinase is an evolutionary driver for organismal fitness.</p>

<p>Plants pollinated by hummingbirds or bats produce dilute nectars even though these animals prefer more concentrated sugar solutions. This mismatch is an unsolved evolutionary paradox. Here we show that lower quality, or more dilute, nectars evolve when the strength of preferring larger quantities or higher qualities of nectar diminishes as magnitudes of the physical stimuli increase. In a virtual evolution experiment conducted in the tropical rainforest, bats visited computer-automated flowers with simulated genomes that evolved relatively dilute nectars. Simulations replicated this evolution only when value functions, which relate the physical stimuli to subjective sensations, were nonlinear. Selection also depended on the supply/demand ratio; bats selected for more dilute nectar when competition for food was higher. We predict such a pattern to generally occur when decision-makers consider multiple value <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions simultaneously, and increases of psychological value are not fully proportional to increases in physical magnitude.</p>

An interactive three-dimensional digital atlas and quantitative database of human development
<p>Current knowledge about human development is based on the description of a limited number of embryonic specimens published in original articles and textbooks, often more than 100 years ago. It is exceedingly difficult to verify this knowledge, given the restricted availability of human embryos.

Rogue protein's partners offer hope in Parkinson's disease
<p>It has been 8 years since an astonishing observation persuaded many scientists that the misfolded protein implicated in Parkinson's disease spreads from brain cell to brain cell, like an infection. Last week, findings presented at the huge annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience further buttressed the theory that spread of the rogue protein, called α-synuclein, is responsible for the progressive disease, which is marked by tremor, stiff movements, depression, and, ultimately, dementia. Scientists at the San Diego, California, conference also described their discovery that an obscure protein carried on the cell membranes of neurons and other brain cells blocks the uptake of the α-synuclein into cells. Little is known about TM9SF2, but it is part of a family of proteins that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> the cell membrane and indications are that it may work to transport specific molecules from the outside to the inside of the cell. It is made in abundance in the brain, especially in regions where damage to dopamine-producing neurons is known to give rise to Parkinson's. If it emerges that it is indeed a "catcher's mitt" for α-synuclein, it could provide a drug target for a disease whose 10 million sufferers are sorely in need of new medicines. The same goes for another cell membrane protein, LAG-3, which is present in neurons and which was recently described in <i>Science </i>as binding tightly to the rogue Parkinson's protein.</p>

An integrated diamond nanophotonics platform for quantum-optical networks
<p>Efficient interfaces between photons and quantum emitters form the basis for quantum networks and enable optical nonlinearities at the single-photon level. We demonstrate an integrated platform for scalable quantum nanophotonics based on silicon-vacancy (SiV) color centers coupled to diamond nanodevices. By placing SiV centers inside diamond photonic crystal cavities, we realize a quantum-optical switch controlled by a single color center. We control the switch using SiV metastable states and observe optical switching at the single-photon level. Raman transitions are used to realize a single-photon source with a tunable frequency and <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong> in a diamond waveguide.

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The dynamics of many-body systems <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ning condensed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase transitions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose condensates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives condensates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the condensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.</p>

Positive biodiversity-productivity relationship predominant in global forests
<p>The biodiversity-productivity relationship (BPR) is foundational to our understanding of the global extinction crisis and its impacts on ecosystem functioning. Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and effective conservation of biodiversity. Using ground-sourced data from 777,126 permanent plots, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in forest productivity worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial forest productivity alone—US$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our estimation—is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global conservation. This highlights the need for a worldwide reassessment of biodiversity values, forest management strategies, and conservation priorities.</p>

High-quality graphene via microwave reduction of solution-exfoliated graphene oxide

Graphite oxide with large lateral <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions has an exfoliation yield of ~100%, but it has not been possible to completely remove the oxygen functional groups so that the reduced form of graphene oxide (GO; reduced form: rGO) remains a highly disordered material. Here we report a simple, rapid method to reduce GO into pristine graphene using 1- to 2-second pulses of microwaves. The desirable structural properties are translated into mobility values of >1000 square centimeters per volt per second in field-effect transistors with microwave-reduced GO (MW-rGO) as the channel material and into particularly high activity for MW-rGO catalyst support toward oxygen evolution reactions.</p>

ONE-HELIX PROTEIN2 (OHP2) Is Required for the Stability of OHP1 and Assembly Factor HCF244 and Is Functionally Linked to PSII Biogenesis
<p>The members of the light-harvesting complex protein family, which include the one-helix proteins (OHPs), are characterized by one to four membrane-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ning helices. These proteins function in light absorption and energy dissipation, sensing light intensity, and triggering photomorphogenesis or the binding of chlorophyll and intermediates of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains two OHPs, while four homologs (named high-light-induced proteins) exist in <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC6803. Various functions have been assigned to high-light-induced proteins, ranging from photoprotection and the assembly of photosystem I (PSI) and PSII to regulation of the early steps of chlorophyll biosynthesis, but little is known about the function of the two plant OHPs. Here, we show that the two Arabidopsis OHPs form heterodimers and that the stromal part of OHP2 interacts with the plastid-localized PSII assembly factor HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244). Moreover, concurrent accumulation of the two OHPs and HCF244 is critical for the stability of all three proteins. In particular, the absence of OHP2 leads to the complete loss of OHP1 and HCF244. We used a virus-induced gene silencing approach to minimize the expression of <i>OHP1</i> or <i>OHP2</i> in adult Arabidopsis plants and revealed that OHP2 is essential for the accumulation of the PSII core subunits, while the other photosynthetic complexes and the major light-harvesting complex proteins remained unaffected. We examined the potential functions of the OHP1-OHP2-HCF244 complex in the assembly and/or repair of PSII and propose a role for this heterotrimeric complex in thylakoid membrane biogenesis.</p>

Soft X-Ray Imaging of Cellular Carbon and Nitrogen Distributions in Heterocystous Cyanobacteria
<p>Soft x-ray microscopy (SXM) is a minimally invasive technique for single-cell high-resolution imaging as well as the visualization of intracellular distributions of light elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. We used SXM to observe photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in the filamentous cyanobacterium <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120, which can form heterocysts during nitrogen starvation. Statistical and spectroscopic analyses from SXM images around the K-absorption edge of nitrogen revealed a significant difference in the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio between vegetative cells and heterocysts. Application of this analysis to soft x-ray images of <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120 revealed inhomogenous C/N ratios in the cells. Furthermore, soft x-ray tomography of <i>Anabaena</i> sp.

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy photosynthesis in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy photosynthesis. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale photosynthesis to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy photosynthesis through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy photosynthesis should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal distribution of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy photosynthesis can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase photosynthesis arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical distribution of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the distribution of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

Reassessing the Roles of PIN Proteins and Anticlinal Microtubules during Pavement Cell Morphogenesis
<p>The leaf epidermis is a biomechanical shell that influences the size and shape of the organ. Its morphogenesis is a multiscale process in which nanometer-scale cytoskeletal protein complexes, individual cells, and groups of cells pattern growth and define macroscopic leaf traits. Interdigitated growth of neighboring cells is an evolutionarily conserved developmental strategy. Understanding how signaling pathways and cytoskeletal proteins pattern cell walls during this form of tissue morphogenesis is an important research challenge. The cellular and molecular control of a lobed cell morphology is currently thought to involve PIN-FORMED (PIN)-type plasma membrane efflux carriers that generate subcellular auxin gradients. Auxin gradients were proposed to function across cell boundaries to encode stable offset patterns of cortical microtubules and actin filaments between adjacent cells. Many models suggest that long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal cell wall generate local cell wall heterogeneities that restrict local growth and specify the timing and location of lobe formation. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) reverse genetics and multivariate long-term time-lapse imaging to test current cell shape control models. We found that neither PIN proteins nor long-lived microtubules along the anticlinal wall predict the patterns of lobe formation. In fields of lobing cells, anticlinal microtubules are not correlated with cell shape and are unstable at the time scales of cell expansion. Our analyses indicate that anticlinal microtubules have multiple functions in pavement cells and that lobe initiation is likely controlled by complex interactions among cell geometry, cell wall stress patterns, and transient microtubule networks that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> the anticlinal and periclinal walls.</p>

Arabidopsis Novel Glycine-Rich Plasma Membrane PSS1 Protein Enhances Disease Resistance in Transgenic Soybean Plants
<p>Nonhost resistance is defined as the immunity of a plant species to all nonadapted pathogen species. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ecotype Columbia-0 is nonhost to the oomycete plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora sojae</i> and the fungal plant pathogen <i>Fusarium virguliforme</i> that are pathogenic to soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>). Previously, we reported generating the <i>pss1</i> mutation in the <i>pen1-1</i> genetic background as well as genetic mapping and characterization of the Arabidopsis nonhost resistance <i>Phytophthora sojae</i>-susceptible gene locus, <i>PSS1</i>. In this study, we identified six candidate <i>PSS1</i> genes by comparing single-nucleotide polymorphisms of (1) the bulked DNA sample of seven F<sub>2:3</sub> families homozygous for the <i>pss1</i> allele and (2) the <i>pen1-1</i> mutant with Columbia-0. Analyses of T-DNA insertion mutants for each of these candidate <i>PSS1</i> genes identified the <i>At3g59640</i> gene encoding a glycine-rich protein as the putative <i>PSS1</i> gene. Later, complementation analysis confirmed the identity of <i>At3g59640</i> as the <i>PSS1</i> gene. <i>PSS1</i> is induced following <i>P. sojae</i> infection as well as expressed in an organ-specific manner. Coexpression analysis of the available transcriptomic data followed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction suggested that <i>PSS1</i> is coregulated with <i>ATG8a</i> (<i>At4g21980</i>), a core gene in autophagy. PSS1 contains a predicted single membrane-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ning domain. Subcellular localization study indicated that it is an integral plasma membrane protein. Sequence analysis suggested that soybean is unlikely to contain a PSS1-like defense function. Following the introduction of <i>PSS1</i> into the soybean cultivar Williams 82, the transgenic plants exhibited enhanced resistance to <i>F. virguliforme</i>, the pathogen that causes sudden death syndrome.</p>

Photosynthetic Efficiency as Bioindicator of Environmental Pressure in <i>A. halleri</i>
<p>In earlier ecophysiological studies that were conducted on <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> plants, scientists focused on the mechanisms of Cd and Zn hyperaccumulation but did not take into consideration the environmental factors that can significantly affect the physiological responses of plants in situ. In this study, we investigated <i>A. halleri</i> that was growing on two nonmetalliferous and three metalliferous sites, which were characterized by different environmental conditions. We compared these populations in order to find differences within the metallicolous and nonmetallicolous groups that have not yet been investigated. The concentrations of several elements in the plant and soil samples also were investigated. To our knowledge, the concentration and fluorescence of chlorophyll were measured for <i>A. halleri</i> in situ for the first time. Our study confirmed the hyperaccumulation of Cd and Zn for each metallicolous population. For the metallicolous populations, the inhibition of parameters that describe the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus with increasing accumulations of heavy metals in the shoots also was observed.

Apparent Overinvestment in Leaf Venation Relaxes Leaf Morphological Constraints on Photosynthesis in Arid Habitats
<p>Leaf veins supply the mesophyll with water that evaporates when stomata are open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Theoretical analyses suggest that water is optimally distributed in the mesophyll when the lateral distance between veins (<i>d</i><sub>x</sub>) is equal to the distance from these veins to the epidermis (<i>d</i><sub>y</sub>), expressed as <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ≈ 1. Although this theory is supported by observations of many derived angiosperms, we hypothesize that plants in arid environments may reduce <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> below unity owing to climate-specific functional adaptations of increased leaf thickness and increased vein density. To test our hypothesis, we assembled leaf hydraulic, morphological, and photosynthetic traits of 68 species from the <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Corymbia</i> genera (termed eucalypts) along an aridity gradient in southwestern Australia. We inferred the potential gas-exchange advantage of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> using a model that links leaf morphology and hydraulics to photosynthesis. Our observations reveal that eucalypts in arid environments have thick amphistomatous leaves with high vein densities, resulting in <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ratios that range from 1.6 to 0.15 along the aridity gradient. Our model suggests that, as leaves become thicker, the effect of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> is to offset the reduction in leaf gas exchange that would result from maintaining <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> at unity. This apparent overinvestment in leaf venation may be explained from the selective pressure of aridity, under which traits associated with long leaf life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>, high hydraulic and thermal capacitances, and high potential rates of leaf water transport confer a competitive advantage.</p>

A Legume TOR Protein Kinase Regulates <i>Rhizobium</i> Symbiosis and Is Essential for Infection and Nodule Development
<p>The target of rapamycin (<i>TOR</i>) protein kinase regulates metabolism, growth, and life <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> in yeast, animals, and plants in coordination with nutrient status and environmental conditions. The nutrient-dependent nature of <i>TOR</i> functionality makes this kinase a putative regulator of symbiotic associations involving nutrient acquisition. However, <i>TOR</i>’s role in these processes remains to be understood. Here, we uncovered the role of <i>TOR</i> during the bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>)-<i>Rhizobium tropici</i> (<i>Rhizobium</i>) symbiotic interaction. <i>TOR</i> was expressed in all tested bean tissues, with higher transcript levels in the root meristems and senesced nodules. We showed <i>TOR</i> promoter expression along the progressing infection thread and in the infected cells of mature nodules. Posttranscriptional gene silencing of <i>TOR</i> using RNA interference (RNAi) showed that this gene is involved in lateral root elongation and root cell organization and also alters the density, size, and number of root hairs. The suppression of <i>TOR</i> transcripts also affected infection thread progression and associated cortical cell divisions, resulting in a drastic reduction of nodule numbers. <i>TOR</i>-RNAi resulted in reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation and altered <i>CyclinD1</i> and <i>CyclinD3</i> expression, which are crucial factors for infection thread progression and nodule organogenesis. Enhanced expression of <i>TOR</i>-regulated <i>ATG</i> genes in <i>TOR</i>-RNAi roots suggested that <i>TOR</i> plays a role in the recognition of <i>Rhizobium</i> as a symbiont. Together, these data suggest that <i>TOR</i> plays a vital role in the establishment of root nodule symbiosis in the common bean.</p>

Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional differentiation of sex chromosomes and is thus a crucial step in the process of sex chromosome evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different sex chromosome system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y chromosome and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which diverged from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of sex chromosomes based on comparative analyses of these divergent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both chromosome-wide differentiation patterns and phylogenetic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral sex chromosomes were extensively differentiated before the divergence of these lineages. In contrast, genetic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-sex chromosomes. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ning the ancestral and neo-sex chromosomes. Chromosomal regions exhibiting genetic differentiation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-sex chromosomes, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of sex chromosome differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of sex chromosome evolution.</p>

Experimental analysis of the liquid-feeding mechanism of the butterfly <i>Pieris rapae</i>
<p>The butterfly <i>Pieirs rapae</i> drinks liquid using a long proboscis. A high pressure gradient is induced in the proboscis when cibarial pump muscles contract. However, liquid feeding through the long proboscis poses a disadvantage of high flow resistance. Hence, butterflies may possess special features to compensate for this disadvantage and succeed in foraging. The main objective of this study is to analyze the liquid-feeding mechanism of butterflies. The systaltic motion of the cibarial pump organ was visualized using the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique. In addition, an ellipsoidal pump model was established based on synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography. To determine the relationship between the cyclic variation of the pump volume and the liquid-feeding flow, velocity fields of the intake flow at the tip of the proboscis were measured using micro-particle image velocimetry. Reynolds and Womersley numbers of liquid-feeding flow in the proboscis were ~1.40 and 0.129, respectively. The liquid-feeding flow could be characterized as a quasi-steady state laminar flow. Considering these results, we analyzed the <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions of the feeding apparatus on the basis of minimum energy consumption during the liquid-feeding process. The relationship between the proboscis and the cibarial pump was determined when minimum energy consumption occurs. As a result, the volume of the cibarial pump is proportional to the cube of the radius of the proboscis. It seems that the liquid-feeding system of butterflies and other long-proboscid insects follow the cube relationship. The present results provide insights into the feeding strategies of liquid-feeding butterflies.</p>

The effects of the noise were tested at probe frequencies ranging from −0.5 to +1.5 octaves relative to the noise center frequency. The effect was estimated in terms of both immediate (1.5 min) post-exposure TTS and recovery duration. The highest TTS with the longest recovery duration was produced by noises of lower frequencies (11.2 and 22.5 kHz) and appeared at a test frequency of +0.5 octave. At higher noise frequencies (45 and 90 kHz), the TTS decreased. The TTS effect gradually increased with prolonged exposures ranging from 1 to 30 min. There was a considerable TTS difference between the two subjects.</p>

Activity levels and return to work following total knee arthroplasty in patients under 65 years of age
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Little is known about employment following total knee arthroplasty   (TKA). This study aims to identify factors which predict return   to work following TKA in patients of working age in the United Kingdom.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients & Methods</title><p>We prospectively assessed 289 patients (289 TKAs) aged ≤ 65 years   who underwent TKA between 2010 and 2013. There were 148 women. The   following were recorded pre-operatively: age, gender, body mass   index, social deprivation, comorbidities, indication for surgery,   work status and nature of employment, activity level as assessed by   the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score   and Oxford Knee Score (OKS). The intention of patients to return   to work or to retire was not assessed pre-operatively. At a mean   of 3.4 years (2 to 4) post-operatively, the return to work status,   OKS, the EuroQol-5 <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions (EQ-5D) score, UCLA activity score   and Work, Osteoarthritis and joint-Replacement (WORQ) score were   obtained. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 261 patients (90%) who were working before TKA, 105 (40%)   returned to any job, including 89 (34%) who returned to the same   job at a mean of 13.5 weeks (2 to 104) post-operatively. A total   of 108 (41%) retired following TKA and 18 remained on welfare. Patients   not working before the operation did not return to work. Median   UCLA scores improved in 125 patients (58%) from 4 (mild activity)   to 6 (moderate activity) (p < 0.001). Significant    (p < 0.05) factors which were predictive of return to any work   included age, heavy or moderate manual work, better post-operative   UCLA, OKS and EQ-5D general health scores. Significant predictive   factors of return to the same work included age, heavy or moderate   manual work and post-operative OKS. Multivariate analysis confirmed   heavy or moderate manual work and age to independently predict a   return to either any or the same work. All patients aged < 50   years who were working pre-operatively returned to any work as did   60% of those aged between 50 and 54 years, 50% of those aged between   55 and 59 years and 24% those aged between 60 and 65 years. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>If working pre-operatively, patients aged < 50 years invariably   returned to work following TKA, but only half of those aged between   50 to 60 years returned. High post-operative activity levels and   patient reported outcome measures do not predict return to work   following TKA.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1037–46.</p></sec>

Quality of life after resection of a chordoma of the mobile spine
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of the study was to compare measures of the quality of   life (QOL) after resection of a chordoma of the mobile spine with   the national averages in the United States and to assess which factors   influenced the QOL, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and coping   with pain post-operatively in these patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 48 consecutive patients who underwent resection of   a primary or recurrent chordoma of the mobile spine between 2000   and 2015 were included. A total of 34 patients completed a survey   at least 12 months post-operatively. The primary outcome was the   EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were   the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS)   anxiety, depression and pain interference questionnaires. Data which   were recorded included the indication for surgery, the region of   the tumour, the number of levels resected, the status of the surgical   margins, re-operations, complications, neurological deficit, length   of stay in hospital and rate of re-admission.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median EQ-5D-3L score was 0.71 (interquartile range (IQR)   0.44 to 0.79) which is worse than the national average in the United   States of 0.85 (p < 0.001). Anxiety (median: 55 (IQR 49 to 61),   p = 0.031) and pain (median: 61 (IQR 56 to 68), p < 0.001) were   also worse than the national average in the United States (50),   while depression was not (median: 52 (IQR 38 to 57), p = 0.513).   Patients who underwent a primary resection had better QOL and less anxiety,   depression and pain compared with those who underwent resection   for recurrent or residual disease. The one- and five-year probabilities   were 0.96 and 0.74 for survival, 0.07 and 0.25 for tumour recurrence,   and 0.02 and 0.16 for developing distant metastasis. A total of   25 local complications occurred in 20 patients (42%), and there were   50 systemic and other complications in 25 patients (52%) within   90 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These patient reported outcomes and oncological and surgical   outcomes can be used when counselling patients and to aid decision-making   when planning surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:979–86.</p></sec>

Oxidised zirconium <i>versus</i> cobalt alloy bearing surfaces in total knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We sought to establish whether an oxidised zirconium (OxZr) femoral   component causes less loss of polyethylene volume than a cobalt   alloy (CoCr) femoral component in total knee arthroplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 20 retrieved tibial inserts that had articulated with   OxZr components were matched with 20 inserts from CoCr articulations   for patient age, body mass index, length of implantation, and revision   diagnosis. Changes in <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ions of the articular surfaces were compared   with those of pristine inserts using laser scanning.

The volume loss in the OxZr group was   also lower in the medial (72 mm<sup>3 </sup>(<sc>sd</sc> 67) <i>versus</i> 92   mm<sup>3 </sup>(<sc>sd</sc> 60); p = 0.096) and lateral (49 mm<sup>3 </sup>(<sc>sd</sc> 36)<i> versus</i> 79   mm<sup>3 </sup>(<sc>sd</sc> 61); p = 0.096) compartments separately,   but these differences were not significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results corroborate earlier findings from <i>in vitro</i> testing   and visual retrieval analysis which suggest that polyethylene volume   loss is lower with OxZr femoral components.

An evolution in the management of fractures of the ankle
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>There has been an evolution recently in the management of unstable   fractures of the ankle with a trend towards direct fixation of a   posterior malleolar fragment. Within these fractures, Haraguchi   type 2 fractures extend medially and often cannot be fixed using   a standard posterolateral approach. Our aim was to describe the   posteromedial approach to address these fractures and to assess   its efficacy and safety.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We performed a review of 15 patients with a Haraguchi type 2   posterior malleolar fracture which was fixed using a posteromedial   approach. Five patients underwent initial temporary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>ning external   fixation. The outcome was assessed at a median follow-up of 29 months (interquartile   range (IQR) 17 to 36) using the Olerud and Molander score and radiographs were   assessed for the quality of the reduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median Olerud and Molander score was 72 (IQR 70 to 75), representing   a good functional outcome. The reduction was anatomical in ten,   with a median step of 1.2 mm (IQR 0.9 to 1.85) in the remaining   five patients. One patient had parasthaesiae affecting the medial   forefoot, which resolved within three months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that the posteromedial approach to the ankle for the   surgical treatment of Haraguchi type 2 posterior malleolar fractures   is a safe technique that enables good visualisation and reduction   of the individual fracture fragments with promising early outcomes.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1496–1501.</p></sec>

Assessing treatment outcomes using a single question
<p>Satisfaction with care is important to both patients   and to those who pay for it. The Net Promoter Score (NPS), widely   used in the service industries, has been introduced into the NHS   as the ‘friends and family test’; an overarching measure of patient   satisfaction. It assesses the likelihood of the patient recommending   the healthcare received to another, and is seen as a discriminator   of healthcare performance. We prospectively assessed 6186 individuals   undergoing primary lower limb joint replacement at a single university   hospital to determine the Net Promoter Score for joint replacements   and to evaluate which factors contributed to the response. </p><p>Achieving pain relief (odds ratio (OR) 2.13, confidence interval   (CI) 1.83 to 2.49), the meeting of pre-operative expectation (OR   2.57, CI 2.24 to 2.97), and the hospital experience (OR 2.33, CI   2.03 to 2.68) are the domains that explain whether a patient would   recommend joint replacement services. These three factors, combined   with the type of surgery undertaken (OR 2.31, CI 1.68 to 3.17),   drove a predictive model that was able to explain 95% of the variation   in the patient’s recommendation response. Though intuitively similar,   this ‘recommendation’ metric was found to be materially different   to satisfaction responses. The difference between THR (NPS 71) and   TKR (NPS 49) suggests that no overarching score for a department   should be used without an adjustment for case mix. However, the   Net Promoter Score does measure a further important <strong><<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong> style="color:yellowgreen">dimens</<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">span</span></strong>></strong>ion to   our existing metrics: the patient experience of healthcare delivery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:622–8.</p>

Wound irrigation does not affect health-related quality of life after open fractures: results of a randomized controlled trial
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The Fluid Lavage in Open Fracture Wounds (FLOW) trial was a multicentre,   blinded, randomized controlled trial that used a 2 × 3 factorial   design to evaluate the effect of irrigation solution (soap <i>versus</i> normal   saline) and irrigation pressure (very low <i>versus</i> low <i>versus</i> high)   on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with open fractures.   In this study, we used this dataset to ascertain whether these factors   affect whether HRQL returns to pre-injury levels at 12-months post-injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Participants completed the Short Form-12 (SF-12) and the EuroQol-5   Dimensions (EQ-5D) at baseline (pre-injury recall), at two and six   weeks, and at three, six, nine and 12-months post-fracture. We calculated   the Physical Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Component Score   (MCS) of the SF-12 and the EQ-5D utility score, conducted an analysis   using a multi-level generalized linear model, and compared differences   between the baseline and 12-month scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found no clinically important differences between irrigating   solutions or pressures for the SF-12 PCS, SF-12 MCS and EQ-5D. Irrespective   of treatment, participants had not returned to their pre-injury   function at 12-months for any of the three outcomes (p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Neither the composition of the irrigation solution nor irrigation   pressure applied had an effect on HRQL. Irrespective of treatment,   patients had not returned to their pre-injury HRQL at 12 months   post-fracture.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:88–94.</p></sec>

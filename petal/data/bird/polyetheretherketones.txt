Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion using polyetheretherketone oblique cages with and without a titanium coating
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We compared the clinical and radiological outcomes of using a   polyetheretherketone cage with (TiPEEK) and without a titanium coating   (PEEK) for instrumented transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We conducted a randomised clinical pilot trial of 40 patients   who were scheduled to undergo a TLIF procedure at one or two levels   between L2 and L5. The Oswestry disability index (ODI), EuroQoL-5D,   and back and leg pain were determined pre-operatively, and at three,   six, and 12 months post-operatively. Fusion rates were assessed   by thin slice CT at three months and by functional radiography at   12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At final follow-up, one patient in each group had been lost to   follow-up. Two patients in each of the PEEK and TiPEEK groups were   revised for pseudarthrosis (p = 1.00). The rate of complete or partial   fusion at three months was 91.7% in both groups. Overall, there   were no significant differences in ODI or in radiological outcomes   between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Favourable results with identical clinical outcomes and a high   rate of fusion was seen in both groups. The titanium coating appears   to have no negative effects on outcome or safety in the short term.   A future study to determine the effect of titanium coating is warranted.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1366â€“72.</p></sec>

Synaptic scaling in sleep
<p>Sleep appears to be a universal phenomenon in the animal kingdom (<i>1</i>) and lack of sleep leads to severe cognitive disruption (<i>2</i>). Yet, the biological function of sleep is unknown. On pages 507 and 511 of this issue, de Vivo <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) and Diering <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>), respectively, provide a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">peek</span></strong> into the nightlife of synapses, the neural connections in the nervous system. The studies reveal substantial alterations in the structure and molecular machinery of synapses during sleep.</p>

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of carbohydrate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low temperatures on the carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large increases in the sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-temperature responses. When trees were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the initiation and completion of chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different temperature effects more closely, we compared the carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the temperatures when sufficient chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total carbohydrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated chilling. Instead, as chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that carbohydrates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total carbohydrate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature responses on carbohydrate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

Identification and Metabolite Profiling of Chemical Activators of Lipid Accumulation in Green Algae
<p>Microalgae are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing biofuels and coproducts. However, several limitations must be overcome before algae-based production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this barrier, a chemical genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 compounds were screened against <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, and 243 compounds were identified that increase triacylglyceride (TAG) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation without terminating growth. Identified compounds were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong></span></strong>ed by structural similarity, and 15 were selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth fitness, photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation was verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification of total fatty acids, and targeted TAG and galactolipid measurements were performed using liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry. These results demonstrated that TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation does not necessarily proceed at the expense of galactolipid. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into pathway shifts due to five different compound treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic stresses commonly used to induce oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in algae. The efficacy of these compounds also was demonstrated in three other algal species. These lipid-inducing compounds offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the biochemical mechanisms of lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in algae and a direct means to improve algal oil content independent of the severe growth limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.</p>

The R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor MYB49 Regulates Cadmium Accumulation
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of potentially toxic cadmium (Cd) in plants. How the ABA signal is transmitted to modulate Cd uptake remains largely unclear. Here, we report that the basic region/Leu zipper transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5), a central ABA signaling molecule, is involved in ABA-repressed Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in plants by physically interacting with a previously uncharacterized R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, MYB49. Overexpression of the Cd-induced <i>MYB49</i> gene in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) resulted in a significant increase in Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation, whereas <i>myb49</i> knockout plants and plants expressing chimeric repressors of <i>MYB49</i>:ERF-associated amphiphilic repression motif repression domain (<i>SRDX49</i>) exhibited reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of Cd. Further investigations revealed that MYB49 positively regulates the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors <i>bHLH38</i> and <i>bHLH101</i> by directly binding to their promoters, leading to activation of <i>IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER1</i>, which encodes a metal transporter involved in Cd uptake. MYB49 also binds to the promoter regions of the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (<i>HIPP22</i>) and <i>HIPP44</i>, resulting in up-regulation of their expression and subsequent Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. On the other hand, as a feedback mechanism to control Cd uptake and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in plant cells, Cd-induced ABA up-regulates the expression of <i>ABI5</i>, whose protein product interacts with MYB49 and prevents its binding to the promoters of downstream genes, thereby reducing Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. Our results provide new insights into the molecular feedback mechanisms underlying ABA signaling-controlled Cd uptake and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in plants.</p>

Altered Expression of a Malate-Permeable Anion Channel, OsALMT4, Disrupts Mineral Nutrition
<p>Aluminum-activated malate transporters (ALMTs) form a family of anion channels in plants, but little is known about most of its members. This study examined the function of <i>OsALMT4</i> from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We show that <i>OsALMT4</i> is expressed in roots and shoots and that the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing (OX) <i>OsALMT4</i> released malate from the roots constitutively and had 2-fold higher malate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the xylem sap than nulls, indicating greater <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of malate in the apoplast. OX lines developed brown necrotic spots on the leaves that did not appear on nulls. These symptoms were not associated with altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of any mineral element in the leaves, although the OX lines had higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of Mn and B in their grain compared with nulls. While total leaf Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations were not different between the OX and null lines, Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the apoplast were greater in the OX plants. The OX lines also displayed increased expression of Mn transporters and were more sensitive to Mn toxicity than null plants. We showed that the growth of wild-type rice was unaffected by 100 µ<sc>m</sc> Mn in hydroponics but, when combined with 1 m<sc>m</sc> malate, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation inhibited growth. We conclude that increasing <i>OsALMT4</i> expression affected malate efflux and compartmentation within the tissues, which increased Mn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the apoplast of leaves and induced the toxicity symptoms. This study reveals new links between malate transport and mineral nutrition.</p>

Elevated carboxyhemoglobin in a marine mammal, the northern elephant seal
<p>Low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), generated primarily through degradation of heme from heme-proteins, have been shown to maintain physiological function of organs and to exert cytoprotective effects. However, high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), formed by CO binding to hemoglobin, potentially prevent adequate O<sub>2</sub> delivery to tissues by lowering arterial O<sub>2</sub> content. Elevated heme-protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, as found in marine mammals, are likely associated with greater heme degradation, more endogenous CO production and, consequently, elevated COHb <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Therefore, we measured COHb in elephant seals, a species with large blood volumes and elevated hemoglobin and myoglobin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. The levels of COHb were positively related to the total hemoglobin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. The maximum COHb value was 10.4% of total hemoglobin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. The mean (±s.e.m.) value in adult seals was 8.7±0.3% (<i>N</i>=6), while juveniles and pups (with lower heme-protein contents) had lower mean COHb values of 7.6±0.2% and 7.1±0.3%, respectively (<i>N</i>=9 and <i>N</i>=9, respectively). Serial samples over several hours revealed little to no fluctuation in COHb values. This consistent elevation in COHb suggests that the magnitude and/or rate of heme-protein turnover is much higher than in terrestrial mammals. The maximum COHb values from this study decrease total body O<sub>2</sub> stores by 7%, thereby reducing the calculated aerobic dive limit for this species. However, the constant presence of elevated CO in blood may also protect against potential ischemia–reperfusion injury associated with the extreme breath-holds of elephant seals. We suggest the elephant seal represents an ideal model for understanding the potential cytoprotective effects, mechanisms of action and evolutionary adaptation associated with chronically elevated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of endogenously produced CO.</p>

Preassembled GPCR signaling complexes mediate distinct cellular responses to ultralow ligand concentrations
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of cell surface signaling proteins, participate in nearly all physiological processes, and are the targets of 30% of marketed drugs. Typically, nanomolar to micromolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand are used to activate GPCRs in experimental systems. We detected GPCR responses to a wide range of ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, from attomolar to millimolar, by measuring GPCR-stimulated production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with high spatial and temporal resolution. Mathematical modeling showed that femtomolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand activated, on average, 40% of the cells in a population provided that a cell was activated by one to two binding events. Furthermore, activation of the endogenous β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (β<sub>2</sub>AR) and muscarinic acetylcholine M<sub>3</sub> receptor (M<sub>3</sub>R) by femtomolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand in cell lines and human cardiac fibroblasts caused sustained increases in nuclear translocation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and cytosolic protein kinase C (PKC) activity, respectively. These responses were spatially and temporally distinct from those that occurred in response to higher <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ligand and resulted in a distinct cellular proteomic profile. This highly sensitive signaling depended on the GPCRs forming preassembled, higher-order signaling complexes at the plasma membrane. Recognizing that GPCRs respond to ultralow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of neurotransmitters and hormones challenges established paradigms of drug action and provides a previously unappreciated aspect of GPCR activation that is quite distinct from that typically observed with higher ligand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the intestine generates luminal carbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trap</span></strong>eritoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ated fraction but also the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

Chemoattractant concentration–dependent tuning of ERK signaling dynamics in migrating neutrophils
<p>The directed migration (chemotaxis) of neutrophils toward the bacterial peptide <i>N</i>-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (<i>f</i>MLP) is a crucial process in immune defense against invading bacteria. While navigating through a gradient of increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of <i>f</i>MLP, neutrophils and neutrophil-like HL-60 cells switch from exhibiting directional migration at low <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations to exhibiting circuitous migration at high <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. The extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is implicated in balancing this <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation–dependent switch in migration modes. We investigated the role and regulation of ERK signaling through single-cell analysis of neutrophil migration in response to different <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations over time. We found that ERK exhibited gradated, rather than all-or-none, responses to <i>f</i>MLP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Maximal ERK activation occurred in response to about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP, and ERK inactivation was promoted by p38. Furthermore, we found that directional migration of neutrophils reached a maximal extent at about 100 nM <i>f</i>MLP and that ERK, but not p38, was required for neutrophil migration. Thus, our data suggest that, in chemotactic neutrophils responding to <i>f</i>MLP, ERK displays gradated activation and p38-dependent inhibition and that these ERK dynamics promote neutrophil migration.</p>

Control of potassium homeostasis is an essential function of the second messenger cyclic di-AMP in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>
<p>The second messenger cyclic di–adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is essential in the Gram-positive model organism <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and in related pathogenic bacteria. It controls the activity of the conserved <i>ydaO</i> riboswitch and of several proteins involved in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) uptake. We found that the YdaO protein was conserved among several different bacteria and provide evidence that YdaO functions as a K<sup>+</sup> transporter. Thus, we renamed the gene and protein KimA (K<sup>+</sup> importer A). Reporter activity assays indicated that expression beyond the c-di-AMP–responsive riboswitch of the <i>kimA</i> upstream regulatory region occurred only in bacteria grown in medium containing low K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicated that c-di-AMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated in bacteria grown in the presence of high K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations but not in low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. A bacterial strain lacking all genes encoding c-di-AMP–synthesizing enzymes was viable when grown in medium containing low K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, but not at higher K<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations unless it acquired suppressor mutations in the gene encoding the cation exporter NhaK. Thus, our results indicated that the control of potassium homeostasis is an essential function of c-di-AMP.</p>

Recurrent cortical circuits implement concentration-invariant odor coding
<p>Animals rely on olfaction to find food, attract mates, and avoid predators. To support these behaviors, they must be able to identify odors across different odorant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. The neural circuit operations that implement this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation invariance remain unclear. We found that despite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-dependence in the olfactory bulb (OB), representations of odor identity were preserved downstream, in the piriform cortex (PCx). The OB cells responding earliest after inhalation drove robust responses in sparse subsets of PCx neurons. Recurrent collateral connections broadcast their activation across the PCx, recruiting global feedback inhibition that rapidly truncated and suppressed cortical activity for the remainder of the sniff, discounting the impact of slower, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation-dependent OB inputs.

Systems-level analysis of mechanisms regulating yeast metabolic flux
<p>Cellular metabolic fluxes are determined by enzyme activities and metabolite abundances. Biochemical approaches reveal the impact of specific substrates or regulators on enzyme kinetics but do not capture the extent to which metabolite and enzyme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations vary across physiological states and, therefore, how cellular reactions are regulated. We measured enzyme and metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations and metabolic fluxes across 25 steady-state yeast cultures. We then assessed the extent to which flux can be explained by a Michaelis-Menten relationship between enzyme, substrate, product, and potential regulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. This revealed three previously unrecognized instances of cross-pathway regulation, which we biochemically verified. One of these involved inhibition of pyruvate kinase by citrate, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated and thereby curtailed glycolytic outflow in nitrogen-limited yeast. Overall, substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations were the strongest driver of the net rates of cellular metabolic reactions, with metabolite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations collectively having more than double the physiological impact of enzymes.</p>

OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-Type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution
<p>Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Cu trafficking and distribution to different organs in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we report the function and role of Antioxidant Protein1 (OsATX1), a Cu chaperone in rice. Knocking out <i>OsATX1</i> resulted in increased Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in roots, whereas <i>OsATX1</i> overexpression reduced root Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations but increased Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in the shoots. At the reproductive stage, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of Cu in developing tissues, including panicles, upper nodes and internodes, younger leaf blades, and leaf sheaths of the main tiller, were increased significantly in <i>OsATX1</i>-overexpressing plants and decreased in <i>osatx1</i> mutants compared with the wild type. The <i>osatx1</i> mutants also showed a higher Cu <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation in older leaves. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsATX1 interacts with the rice heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases HMA4, HMA5, HMA6, and HMA9. These results suggest that OsATX1 may function to deliver Cu to heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases for Cu trafficking and distribution in order to maintain Cu homeostasis in different rice tissues. In addition, heterologous expression of <i>OsATX1</i> in the yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) cadmium-sensitive mutant Δ<i>ycf1</i> increased the tolerance to Cu and cadmium by decreasing their respective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the transformed yeast cells. Taken together, our results indicate that OsATX1 plays an important role in facilitating root-to-shoot Cu translocation and the redistribution of Cu from old leaves to developing tissues and seeds in rice.</p>

<i>Medicago</i> Plants Control Nodulation by Regulating Proteolysis of the Receptor-Like Kinase DMI2
<p>Plants use receptor-like kinases to monitor environmental changes and transduce signals into plant cells. The <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (hereafter <i>M</i>. <i>truncatula</i>) DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS2 (DMI2) protein functions as a coreceptor of rhizobial signals to initiate nodule development and rhizobial infection during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, but the mechanisms regulating DMI2 protein level and folding are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> unknown. Here, we report that DMI2 protein abundance changes during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ates in the nodules and is induced by rhizobia treatment through a posttranscriptional process. However, DMI2 induction is independent of the perception of Nod factor, a group of lipochitooligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia. The stability of the DMI2 protein is controlled by the proteasome pathway: in rhizobia-free environments, DMI2 is degraded by the proteasome, but during rhizobial infection, DMI2 is protected from the proteasome, resulting in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor-promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of DMI2 protein in <i>Medicago</i> roots induces the expression of two early nodulation marker genes, supporting the hypothesis that DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation activates downstream symbiosis signaling. The extracellular region of DMI2 contains two malectin-like domains (MLDs) and a leucine-rich repeat. When conserved amino acids in the MLDs are mutated, DMI2 fails to restore nodule development in <i>dmi2</i> mutants, and point-mutated MLD proteins are degraded constitutively, suggesting that the MLD may be vital for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of DMI2. Our findings suggest that legumes control nodule development through modulating the protein level of DMI2, revealing a layer of regulation in the interaction between plants and rhizobia in nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.</p>

A Magnesium Transporter OsMGT1 Plays a Critical Role in Salt Tolerance in Rice
<p>Salt stress is one of the major factors limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production globally. Although several transporters involved in salt tolerance have been identified in rice, the mechanisms regulating their transport activity are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a rice Mg transporter OsMGT1 is required for salt tolerance probably by regulating transport activity of OsHKT1;5, a key transporter for the removal of Na<sup>+</sup> from the xylem sap at the root mature zone. Knockout of <i>OsMGT1</i> did not affect total Na uptake, but increased Na <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation in the shoots and xylem sap, resulting in a significant increase in salt sensitivity at low external Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation (20–200 μ<sc>m</sc>). However, such differences were abolished at a higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation (2 m<sc>m</sc>), although the total Na uptake was not altered. <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in both the roots and shoots, but only that in the roots was moderately up-regulated by salt stress. Spatial expression analysis revealed that <i>OsMGT1</i> was expressed in all root cells of the root tips but was highly expressed in the pericycle of root mature zone. <i>OsMGT1</i> was also expressed in the phloem region of basal node, leaf blade, and sheath. When expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, the transport activity of OsHKT1;5 was enhanced by elevating external Mg<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Furthermore, knockout of <i>OsHKT1;5</i> in <i>osmgt1</i> mutant background did not further increase its salt sensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest that Mg<sup>2+</sup> transported by OsMGT1 in the root mature zone is required for enhancing OsHKT1;5 activity, thereby restricting Na <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation to the shoots.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves

We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">evapor</span></strong>ating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

MYB89 Transcription Factor Represses Seed Oil Accumulation
<p>In many higher plants, seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation is precisely controlled by intricate multilevel regulatory networks, among which transcriptional regulation mainly influences oil biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the master positive transcription factors, <i>WRINKLED1</i> (<i>WRI1</i>) and <i>LEAFY COTYLEDON1-LIKE</i> (<i>L1L</i>), are important for seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. We found that an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, MYB89, was expressed predominantly in developing seeds during maturation. Oil and major fatty acid biosynthesis in seeds was significantly promoted by <i>myb89-1</i> mutation and <i>MYB89</i> knockdown; thus, MYB89 was an important repressor during seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. RNA sequencing revealed remarkable up-regulation of numerous genes involved in seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in <i>myb89</i> seeds at 12 d after pollination. Posttranslational activation of a MYB89-glucocorticoid receptor fusion protein and chromatin immuno<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation assays demonstrated that MYB89 inhibited seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation by directly repressing <i>WRI1</i> and five key genes and by indirectly suppressing <i>L1L</i> and 11 key genes involved in oil biosynthesis during seed maturation. These results help us to understand the novel function of MYB89 and provide new insights into the regulatory network of transcriptional factors controlling seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in Arabidopsis.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Plasma Ceramides, Mediterranean Diet, and Incident Cardiovascular Disease in the PREDIMED Trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although in vitro studies and investigations in animal models and small clinical populations have suggested that ceramides may represent an intermediate link between overnutrition and certain pathological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD), no prospective studies have investigated the association between plasma ceramides and risk of CVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The study population consisted of 980 participants from the PREDIMED trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea), including 230 incident cases of CVD and 787 randomly selected participants at baseline (including 37 overlapping cases) followed for ≤7.4 years. Participants were randomized to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts, or a control diet. Plasma ceramide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations were measured on a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics platform.

Tracing the origin and evolution of pseudokinases across the tree of life
<p>Protein phosphorylation by eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) is a fundamental mechanism of cell signaling in all organisms. In model vertebrates, ~10% of ePKs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong></span></strong>ed as pseudokinases, which have amino acid changes within the catalytic machinery of the kinase domain that distinguish them from their canonical kinase counterparts. However, pseudokinases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> regulate various signaling pathways, usually doing so in the absence of their own catalytic output. To investigate the prevalence, evolutionary relationships, and biological diversity of these pseudoenzymes, we performed a comprehensive analysis of putative pseudokinase sequences in available eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal proteomes. We found that pseudokinases are present across all domains of life, and we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">classifi</span></strong></span></strong>ed nearly 30,000 eukaryotic, 1500 bacterial, and 20 archaeal pseudokinase sequences into 86 pseudokinase families, including ~30 families that were previously unknown. We uncovered a rich variety of pseudokinases with notable expansions not only in animals but also in plants, fungi, and bacteria, where pseudokinases have previously received cursory attention. These expansions are accompanied by domain shuffling, which suggests roles for pseudokinases in plant innate immunity, plant-fungal interactions, and bacterial signaling. Mechanistically, the ancestral kinase fold has diverged in many distinct ways through the enrichment of unique sequence motifs to generate new families of pseudokinases in which the kinase domain is repurposed for noncanonical nucleotide binding or to stabilize unique, inactive kinase conformations. We further provide a collection of annotated pseudokinase sequences in the Protein Kinase Ontology (ProKinO) as a new mineable resource for the signaling community.</p>

Building one molecule from a reservoir of two atoms

ATP as a biological hydrotrope
<p>Hydrotropes are small molecules that solubilize hydrophobic molecules in aqueous solutions. Typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic molecules and differ from classical surfactants in that they have low cooperativity of aggregation and work at molar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Here, we show that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has properties of a biological hydrotrope. It can both prevent the formation of and dissolve previously formed protein aggregates. This chemical property is manifested at physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations between 5 and 10 millimolar. Therefore, in addition to being an energy source for biological reactions, for which micromolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations are sufficient, we propose that millimolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations of ATP may act to keep proteins soluble. This may in part explain why ATP is maintained in such high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in cells.</p>

Genetic Dissection of Fe-Dependent Signaling in Root Developmental Responses to Phosphate Deficiency
<p>The inhibition of primary root (PR) growth is a major developmental response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Previous studies have independently uncovered key roles of the LOW PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (LPR1) ferroxidase, the tonoplast-localized ALUMINUM SENSITIVE3 (ALS3)/SENSITIVE TO ALUMINUM RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STAR1) transporter complex, and the SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1; a transcription factor)-ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (ALMT1; a malate transporter) regulatory module in mediating this response by controlling iron (Fe) homeostasis in roots, but how these three components interact to regulate PR growth under Pi deficiency remains unknown. Here, we dissected genetic relationships among these three key components and found that (1) STOP1, ALMT1, and LPR1 act downstream of ALS3/STAR1 in controlling PR growth under Pi deficiency; (2) ALS3/STAR1 inhibits the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway by repressing STOP1 protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in the nucleus; and (3) STOP1-ALMT1 and LPR1 control PR growth under Pi deficiency in an interdependent manner involving the promotion of malate-dependent Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in roots. Furthermore, this malate-mediated Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation depends on external Pi availability. We also performed a detailed analysis of the dynamic changes in the tissue-specific Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation patterns in the root tips of plants exposed to Pi deficiency. The results indicate that the degree of inhibition of PR growth induced by Pi deficiency is not linked to the level of Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated in the root apical meristem or the elongation zone. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism that regulates the root developmental response to Pi deficiency.</p>

NRT1.1-Related NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Toxicity Is Associated with a Disturbed Balance between NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Uptake and Assimilation
<p>A high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) as the sole source of nitrogen in the growth medium often is toxic to plants. The nitrate transporter NRT1.1 is involved in mediating the effects of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity; however, the mechanism remains undefined. In this study, wild-type Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> Columbia-0 [Col-0]) and <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants (<i>chl1-1</i> and <i>chl1-5</i>) were grown hydroponically in NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> media to assess the function of NRT1.1 in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stress responses. All the plants grew normally in medium containing mixed nitrogen sources, but Col-0 displayed more chlorosis and lower biomass and photosynthesis than the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants in (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium. Grafting experiments between Col-0 and <i>chl1-5</i> further confirmed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity is influenced by NRT1.1. In (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> medium, NRT1.1 induced the expression of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> transporters, increasing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> uptake. Additionally, the activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthetase in roots of Col-0 plants decreased and soluble sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated significantly, whereas pyruvate kinase-mediated glycolysis was not affected, all of which contributed to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. By contrast, the <i>NRT1.1</i> mutants showed reduced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> assimilation through glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthetase, and glutamate dehydrogenase. Moreover, the up-regulation of genes involved in ethylene synthesis and senescence in Col-0 plants treated with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> suggests that ethylene is involved in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity responses. This study showed that NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> toxicity is related to a nitrate-independent signaling function of <i>NRT1.1</i> in Arabidopsis, characterized by enhanced NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and altered NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> metabolism, which stimulates ethylene synthesis, leading to plant senescence.</p>

Non-Enzymatic Synthesis of Bioactive Isoprostanoids in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i> following Oxidative Stress
<p>The ecological success of diatoms requires a remarkable ability to survive many types of stress, including variations in temperature, light, salinity, and nutrient availability. On exposure to these stresses, diatoms exhibit common responses, including growth arrest, impairment of photosynthesis, production of reactive oxygen species, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of triacylglycerol (TAG). We studied the production of cyclopentane oxylipins derived from fatty acids in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> in response to oxidative stress. <i>P. tricornutum</i> lacks the enzymatic pathway for producing cyclopentane-oxylipins, such as jasmonate, prostaglandins, or thromboxanes. In cells subjected to increasing doses of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), we detected nonenzymatic production of isoprostanoids, including six phytoprostanes, three F<sub>2t</sub>-isoprostanes, two F<sub>3t</sub>-isoprostanes, and three F<sub>4t</sub>-neuroprostanes, by radical peroxidation of α-linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexanoic acids, respectively. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also triggered photosynthesis impairment and TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. F<sub>1t</sub>-phytoprostanes constitute the major class detected (300 pmol per 1 million cells; intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation, ∼4 µ<sc>m</sc>). Only two glycerolipids, phosphatidylcholine and diacylglycerylhydroxymethyl-trimethyl-alanine, could provide all substrates for these isoprostanoids. Treatment of <i>P. tricornutum</i> with nine synthetic isoprostanoids produced an effect in the micromolar range, marked by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of TAG and reduced growth, without affecting photosynthesis. Therefore, the emission of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and free radicals upon exposure to stresses can lead to glycerolipid peroxidation and nonenzymatic synthesis of isoprostanoids, inhibiting growth and contributing to the induction of TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation via unknown processes. This characterization of nonenzymatic oxylipins in <i>P. tricornutum</i> opens a field of research on the study of processes controlled by isoprostanoid signaling in various physiological and environmental contexts in diatoms.</p>

Chloroplast Accumulation Response Enhances Leaf Photosynthesis and Plant Biomass Production
<p>Under high light intensity, chloroplasts avoid absorbing excess light by moving to anticlinal cell walls (avoidance response), but under low light intensity, chloroplasts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ate along periclinal cell walls (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation response). In most plant species, these responses are induced by blue light and are mediated by the blue light photoreceptor, phototropin, which also regulates phototropism, leaf flattening, and stomatal opening. These phototropin-mediated responses could enhance photosynthesis and biomass production. Here, using various Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in chloroplast movement, we demonstrated that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation response enhances leaf photosynthesis and plant biomass production. Conspicuously, <i>phototropin2</i> mutant plants specifically defective in the avoidance response but not in other phototropin-mediated responses displayed a constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation response irrespective of light intensities, enhanced leaf photosynthesis, and increased plant biomass production.

NDH-PSI Supercomplex Assembly Precedes Full Assembly of the NDH Complex in Chloroplast
<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex is structurally similar to respiratory complex I and mediates PSI cyclic electron flow. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast NDH is composed of at least 29 subunits and associates with two copies of PSI to form the NDH-PSI supercomplex. Here, we found that CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION3 (CRR3) is an assembly factor required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of subcomplex B (SubB) of chloroplast NDH. In Suc density gradient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">centrifug</span></strong>ation, CRR3 was detected in three protein complexes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of the largest peak III complex was impaired in mutants defective in the SubB subunits PnsB2-PnsB5. The oligomeric form of CRR3 likely functions to assemble the core of SubB to form the peak III complex as an assembly intermediate. A defect in the PnsL3 subunit increased the level of the peak III complex, suggesting that CRR3 was released from the assembly intermediate after PnsL3 binding. Unlike PnsB2-PnsB5 and PnsL3, PnsB1 was not absolutely necessary for stabilizing SubB. PnsB1 is likely incorporated into the intermediate at the final step during SubB assembly. Lhca6 is a linker protein mediating NDH-PSI supercomplex formation, and its site of contact with NDH was suggested to be SubB. In the <i>lhca6</i> mutant, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of the peak III complex was impaired, suggesting that SubB interacted with Lhca6 during the step of SubB assembly. The process of supercomplex formation was triggered before the completion of the NDH assembly. Consistent with its predicted function, CRR3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated in young leaves, where the NDH complex was assembled.</p>

A Tonoplast Sugar Transporter Underlies a Sugar Accumulation QTL in Watermelon
<p>How sugar transporters regulate sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in fruits is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation Suc. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of soluble sugars in watermelon (<i>Citrullus lanatus</i>) fruit, a major quality trait, had been selected during domestication. Still, the molecular mechanisms controlling this quantitative trait are unknown. We resequenced 96 recombinant inbred lines, derived from crossing sweet and unsweet accessions, to narrow down the size of a previously described sugar content quantitative trait locus, which contains a putative <i>Tonoplast Sugar Transporter</i> gene (<i>ClTST2</i>). Molecular and biochemical analyses indicated that <i>ClTST2</i> encodes a vacuolar membrane protein, whose expression is associated with tonoplast uptake and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of sugars in watermelon fruit flesh cells. We measured fruit sugar content and resequenced the genomic region surrounding <i>ClTST2</i> in 400 watermelon accessions and associated the most sugar-related significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Large-scale population analyses strongly suggest increased expression of <i>ClTST2</i> as a major molecular event in watermelon domestication associated with a selection sweep around the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter. Further molecular analyses explored the binding of a sugar-induced transcription factor (<i>SUSIWM1</i>) to a sugar-responsive cis‐element within the <i>ClTST2</i> promoter, which contains the quantitative trait locus (QTL) causal SNP. The functional characterization of <i>ClTST2</i> and its expression regulation by <i>SUSIWM1</i> provide novel tools to increase sugar sink potency in watermelon and possibly in other vegetable and fruit crops.</p>

Transcription Factor AREB2 Is Involved in Soluble Sugar Accumulation by Activating Sugar Transporter and Amylase Genes
<p>Sugars play important roles in plant growth and development, crop yield and quality, as well as responses to abiotic stresses. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a multifunctional hormone. However, the exact mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation is largely unknown in plants. Here, we tested the expression profile of several sugar transporter and amylase genes in response to ABA treatment. <i>MdSUT2</i> and <i>MdAREB2</i> were isolated and genetically transformed into apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) to investigate their roles in ABA-induced sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. The MdAREB2 transcription factor was found to bind to the promoters of the sugar transporter and amylase genes and activate their expression. Both MdAREB2 and MdSUT2 transgenic plants produced more soluble sugars than controls. Furthermore, MdAREB2 promoted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of sucrose and soluble sugars in an <i>MdSUT2</i>-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the ABA-responsive transcription factor MdAREB2 directly activates the expression of amylase and sugar transporter genes to promote soluble sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation, suggesting a mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in plants.</p>

Two Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases from <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Have Distinct Roles in Lipid Metabolism
<p>The metabolism of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is important for environmental stress responses by eukaryotic microalgae. G3P is an essential precursor for glycerolipid synthesis and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in response to nutrient starvation. G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH) mediates G3P synthesis, but the roles of specific GPDH isoforms are currently poorly understood. Of the five GPDH enzymes in the model alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> were shown to be induced by nutrient starvation and/or salt stress. Heterologous expression of GPD2, a putative chloroplastic GPDH, and GPD3, a putative cytosolic GPDH, in a yeast <i>gpd1</i>Δ mutant demonstrated the functionality of both enzymes. <i>C. reinhardtii</i> knockdown mutants for <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> showed no difference in growth but displayed significant reduction in TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation compared with the wild type in response to phosphorus or nitrogen starvation. Overexpression of <i>GPD2</i> and <i>GPD3</i> in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> gave distinct phenotypes. <i>GPD2</i> overexpression lines showed only subtle metabolic phenotypes and no significant alteration in growth. In contrast, <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines displayed significantly inhibited growth and chlorophyll <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation, reduced glycerol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation, and changes to lipid composition compared with the wild type, including increased abundance of phosphatidic acids but reduced abundance of diglycerides, triglycerides, and phosphatidylglycerol lipids. This may indicate a block in the downstream glycerolipid metabolism pathway in <i>GPD3</i> overexpression lines. Thus, lipid engineering by GPDH modification may depend on the activities of other downstream enzyme steps. These results also suggest that GPD2 and GPD3 GPDH isoforms are important for nutrient starvation-induced TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation but have distinct metabolic functions.</p>

Ubiquitin-Proteasome Dependent Regulation of the GOLDEN2-LIKE 1 Transcription Factor in Response to Plastid Signals
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GOLDEN2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors promote chloroplast biogenesis by regulating the expression of photosynthesis-related genes. Arabidopsis GLK1 is also known to participate in retrograde signaling from chloroplasts to the nucleus. To elucidate the mechanism by which GLK1 is regulated in response to plastid signals, we biochemically characterized Arabidopsis GLK1 protein. Expression analysis of GLK1 protein indicated that GLK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ates in aerial tissues. Both tissue-specific and Suc-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of GLK1 were regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. In contrast, norflurazon- or lincomycin-treated <i>gun1</i>-<i>101</i> mutant expressing normal levels of <i>GLK1</i> mRNA failed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ate GLK1 protein, suggesting that plastid signals directly regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of GLK1 protein in a GUN1-independent manner. Treatment of the <i>glk1glk2</i> mutant expressing functional GFP-GLK1 with a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of polyubiquitinated GFP-GLK1. Furthermore, the level of endogenous GLK1 in plants with damaged plastids was partially restored when those plants were treated with MG-132. Collectively, these data indicate that the ubiquitin-proteasome system participates in the degradation of Arabidopsis GLK1 in response to plastid signals.</p>

OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 Function as Arsenate Reductases and Regulate Arsenic Accumulation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Rice is a major dietary source of the toxic metalloid arsenic (As). Reducing its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) grain is of critical importance to food safety. Rice roots take up arsenate and arsenite depending on the prevailing soil conditions. The first step of arsenate detoxification is its reduction to arsenite, but the enzyme(s) catalyzing this reaction in rice remains unknown. Here, we identify OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 as arsenate reductases in rice. <i>OsHAC1;1</i> and <i>OsHAC1;2</i> are able to complement an <i>Escherichia coli</i> mutant lacking the endogenous arsenate reductase and to reduce arsenate to arsenite. <i>OsHAC1:1</i> and <i>OsHAC1;2</i> are predominantly expressed in roots, with <i>OsHAC1;1</i> being abundant in the epidermis, root hairs, and pericycle cells while <i>OsHAC1;2</i> is abundant in the epidermis, outer layers of cortex, and endodermis cells. Expression of the two genes was induced by arsenate exposure. Knocking out <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> decreased the reduction of arsenate to arsenite in roots, reducing arsenite efflux to the external medium. Loss of arsenite efflux was also associated with increased As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in shoots. Greater effects were observed in a double mutant of the two genes. In contrast, overexpression of either <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> increased arsenite efflux, reduced As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation, and enhanced arsenate tolerance. When grown under aerobic soil conditions, overexpression of either <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> also decreased As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in rice grain, whereas grain As increased in the knockout mutants. We conclude that OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 are arsenate reductases that play an important role in restricting As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in rice shoots and grain.</p>

An NADPH-Oxidase/Polyamine Oxidase Feedback Loop Controls Oxidative Burst Under Salinity
<p>The apoplastic polyamine oxidase (PAO) catalyzes the oxidation of the higher polyamines spermidine and spermine, contributing to hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. However, it is yet unclear whether apoplastic PAO is part of a network that coordinates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under salinity or if it acts independently. Here, we unravel that NADPH oxidase and apoplastic PAO cooperate to control the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxides (O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>) in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). To examine to what extent apoplastic PAO constitutes part of a ROS-generating network, we examined ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in guard cells of plants overexpressing or down-regulating apoplastic PAO (lines S2.2 and A2, respectively) or down-regulating NADPH oxidase (line AS-<i>NtRbohD</i>/<i>F</i>). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed that, under salinity, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased in S2.2 and decreased in A2 compared with the wild type. Surprisingly, the O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-So showed that O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> levels correlated positively with that of apoplastic PAO (i.e. showed high and low levels in S2.2 and A2, respectively). By using AS-<i>NtRbohD/F</i> lines and a pharmacological approach, we could show that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation at the onset of salinity stress was dependent on NADPH oxidase, indicating that NADPH oxidase is upstream of apoplastic PAO. Our results suggest that NADPH oxidase and the apoplastic PAO form a feed-forward ROS amplification loop, which impinges on oxidative state and culminates in the execution of programmed cell death. We propose that the PAO/NADPH oxidase loop is a central hub in the plethora of responses controlling salt stress tolerance, with potential functions extending beyond stress tolerance.</p>

Regulation of succinate-fuelled mitochondrial respiration in liver and skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels
<p>Hibernating ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) alternate between two distinct metabolic states throughout winter: torpor, during which metabolic rate (MR) and body temperature (<i>T</i><sub>b</sub>) are considerably suppressed, and interbout euthermia (IBE), during which MR and <i>T</i><sub>b</sub> briefly return to euthermic levels. Previous studies showed suppression of succinate-fuelled respiration during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle mitochondria; however, these studies used only a single, saturating succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Therefore, they could not address whether mitochondrial metabolic suppression occurs under physiological substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations or whether differences in the kinetics of mitochondrial responses to changing substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation might also contribute to mitochondrial metabolic regulation during torpor. The present study confirmed that succinate oxidation is reduced during torpor in liver and skeletal muscle at 37 and 10°C over a 100-fold range of succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. At 37°C, this suppression resulted from inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which had a greater affinity for oxaloacetate (an SDH inhibitor) during torpor. At 10°C, SDH was not inhibited, suggesting that SDH inhibition initiates but does not maintain mitochondrial suppression during torpor. Moreover, in both liver and skeletal muscle, mitochondria from torpid animals maintained relatively higher respiration rates at low succinate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations, which reduces the extent of energy savings that can be achieved during torpor, but may also maintain mitochondrial oxidative capacity above some lower critical threshold, thereby preventing cellular and/or mitochondrial injury during torpor and facilitating rapid recruitment of oxidative capacity during arousal.</p>

Ascorbic Acid Integrates the Antagonistic Modulation of Ethylene and Abscisic Acid in the Accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>During plant growth and development, ethylene and abscisic acid (ABA) play important roles and exert synergistic or antagonistic effects on various biological processes, but the detailed mechanism underlying the interaction of the two phytohormones, especially in the regulation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is largely unclear. Here, we report that ethylene inhibits but ABA promotes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of ROS in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, changes in the biosynthesis of ascorbic acid (AsA) act as a key factor in integrating the interaction of ethylene and ABA in the regulation of ROS levels. We found that ethylene and ABA antagonistically regulate AsA biosynthesis via ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) and ABA INSENSITIVE4 (ABI4), which are key factors in the ethylene and ABA signaling pathways, respectively. In addition, <i>ABI4</i> is transcriptionally repressed by EIN3 in ethylene-regulated AsA biosynthesis. Via transcriptome analysis and molecular and genetic experiments, we identified <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i>as the direct target of ABI4 in the regulation of AsA biosynthesis and ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. Thus, the EIN3-ABI4- <i>VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE2</i> transcriptional cascade involves a mechanism by which ethylene and ABA antagonistically regulate AsA biosynthesis and ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in response to complex environmental stimuli.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet oxygen, as visualized using the singlet oxygen-specific probe singlet oxygen sensor green. The production of singlet oxygen was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell death began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet oxygen were observed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of other reactive oxygen species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell death. In addition, both the singlet oxygen scavenger His and the lipoxygenase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet oxygen production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet oxygen plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

MicroRNA166 Modulates Cadmium Tolerance and Accumulation in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20- to 24-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. Several plant miRNAs, such as miR166, have vital roles in plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses. One such environmental stress encountered by crop plants is exposure to cadmium (Cd), an element highly toxic to most organisms, including humans and plants. In this study, we analyzed the role of miR166 in Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and tolerance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The expression levels of miR166 in both root and leaf tissues were significantly higher in the reproductive stage than in the seedling stage in rice. The expression of miR166 in the roots of rice seedlings was reduced after Cd treatment. Overexpression of miR166 in rice improved Cd tolerance, a result associated with the reduction of Cd-induced oxidative stress in transgenic rice plants. Furthermore, overexpression of miR166 reduced both Cd translocation from roots to shoots and Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in the grains. miR166 targets genes encoding the class-III homeodomain-Leu zipper (HD-Zip) family proteins in plants. In rice, <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>) gene (Os03g43930), which encodes an HD-Zip protein, was up-regulated by Cd treatment but down-regulated by overexpression of miR166 in transgenic rice plants. Overexpression of <i>OsHB4</i> increased Cd sensitivity and Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in the leaves and grains of transgenic rice plants. By contrast, silencing <i>OsHB4</i> by RNA interference enhanced Cd tolerance in transgenic rice plants. These results indicate a critical role for miR166 in Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and tolerance through regulation of its target gene, <i>OsHB4</i>, in rice.</p>

A Connection between Lysine and Serotonin Metabolism in Rice Endosperm
<p>Cereal endosperms produce a vast array of metabolites, including the essential amino acid lysine (Lys). Enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of Lys has been achieved via metabolic engineering in cereals, but the potential connection between metabolic engineering and Lys fortification is unclear. In mature seeds of engineered High Free Lysine (HFL) rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), the endosperm takes on a characteristic dark-brown appearance. In this study, we use an integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic approach combined with functional validation to elucidate the key metabolites responsible for the dark-brown phenotype. Importantly, we found that serotonin biosynthesis was elevated dramatically and closely linked with dark-brown endosperm color in HFL rice. A functional connection between serotonin and endosperm color was confirmed via overexpression of TDC3, a key enzyme of serotonin biosynthesis. Furthermore, we show that both the jasmonate signaling pathway and <i>TDC</i> expression were strongly induced in the late stage of endosperm development of HFL rice, coinciding with serotonin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and dark-brown pigmentation. We propose a model for the metabolic connection between Lys and serotonin metabolism in which elevated 2-aminoadipate from Lys catabolism may play a key role in the connection between the jasmonate signaling pathway, serotonin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation, and the brown phenotype in rice endosperm. Our data provide a deeper understanding of amino acid metabolism in rice. In addition, the finding that both Lys and serotonin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ate in HFL rice grains should promote efforts to create a nutritionally favorable crop.</p>

Heat Shock Factor HsfA1a Is Essential for <i>R</i> Gene-Mediated Nematode Resistance and Triggers H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Production<sup>1</sup>
<p>Plants generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the apoplast in response to pathogen attack, especially following resistance (<i>R</i>) gene-mediated pathogen recognition; however, the mechanisms activating ROS generation remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that RKN (<i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>) infection rapidly induces ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in the roots of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants that contain the <i>R</i> gene <i>Mi-1.2</i> but rarely induces ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in the susceptible or <i>Mi-1.2</i>-silenced resistant genotypes. RNK also induces the hypersensitive response, a form of programmed cell death, in <i>Mi-1.2</i> plants. RKN induces the expression of numerous class-A heat shock factor (HsfA) genes in resistant tomato plants. Silencing <i>HsfA1a</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated resistance, apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation, and the transcription of <i>whitefly induced 1</i> (<i>Wfi1</i>), which encodes a respiratory burst oxidase homolog. HsfA1a regulates <i>Wfi1</i> transcription by binding to the <i>Wfi1</i> promoter, and silencing of <i>Wfi1</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated resistance. HsfA1a and Wfi1 are involved in Mi-1.2-triggered Hsp90 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and basal defense in susceptible tomato. Thus, HsfA–1aWfi1-dependent ROS signaling functions as a crucial regulator of plant defense responses.</p>

Evidence That Isoprene Emission Is Not Limited by Cytosolic Metabolites. Exogenous Malate Does Not Invert the Reverse Sensitivity of Isoprene Emission to High [CO<sub>2</sub>]
<p>Isoprene is synthesized via the chloroplastic 2-<i>C</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose 5-phosphate pathway (MEP/DOXP), and its synthesis is directly related to photosynthesis, except under high CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation, when the rate of photosynthesis increases but isoprene emission decreases. Suppression of MEP/DOXP pathway activity by high CO<sub>2</sub> has been explained either by limited supply of the cytosolic substrate precursor, phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate (PEP), into chloroplast as the result of enhanced activity of cytosolic PEP carboxylase or by limited supply of energetic and reductive equivalents. We tested the PEP-limitation hypotheses by feeding leaves with the PEP carboxylase competitive inhibitors malate and diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>). Malate feeding resulted in the inhibition of net assimilation, photosynthetic electron transport, and isoprene emission rates, but DOA feeding did not affect any of these processes except at very high application <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations. Both malate and DOA did not alter the sensitivity of isoprene emission to high CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation. Malate inhibition of isoprene emission was associated with enhanced chloroplastic reductive status that suppressed light reactions of photosynthesis, ultimately leading to reduced isoprene substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate pool size. Additional experiments with altered oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ations in conditions of feedback-limited and non-feedback-limited photosynthesis further indicated that changes in isoprene emission rate in control and malate-inhibited leaves were associated with changes in the share of ATP and reductive equivalent supply for isoprene synthesis. The results of this study collectively indicate that malate importantly controls the chloroplast reductive status and, thereby, affects isoprene emission, but they do not support the hypothesis that cytosolic metabolite availability alters the response of isoprene emission to changes in atmospheric composition.</p>

The E3 Ligase TaSAP5 Alters Drought Stress Responses by Promoting the Degradation of DRIP Proteins
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants growing under normal conditions, DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) is present at low levels because it is ubiquitinated and destabilized by DREB2A INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (DRIP1) and DRIP2 through 26S proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Drought stress counteracts the ubiquitination and proteolysis of DREB2A, thus allowing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of sufficient amounts of DREB2A protein to activate downstream gene expression. The mechanisms leading to drought stress-mediated DREB2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">still</span></strong> unclear. Here, we report that the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) TaSAP5 protein, which contains an A20/AN1 domain, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate DRIP degradation and thus increase DREB2A protein levels. Drought induces <i>TaSAP5</i> expression in wheat, and <i>TaSAP5</i> overexpression in Arabidopsis and wheat seedlings increased their drought tolerance, as measured by survival rate and grain yield under severe drought stress. TaSAP5 can interact with and ubiquitinate TaDRIP, as well as AtDRIP1 and AtDRIP2, leading to their subsequent degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway. Consistent with this, <i>TaSAP5</i> overexpression enhances DRIP degradation and increases the levels of DREB2A protein and its downstream targets. These results suggest that TaSAP5 acts to link drought with DREB2A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and illustrate the molecular mechanisms involved in this process.</p>

Phloem Loading through Plasmodesmata: A Biophysical Analysis
<p>In many species, Suc en route out of the leaf migrates from photosynthetically active mesophyll cells into the phloem down its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation gradient via plasmodesmata, i.e. symplastically. In some of these plants, the process is entirely passive, but in others phloem Suc is actively converted into larger sugars, raffinose and stachyose, and segregated (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trap</span></strong>ped), thus raising total phloem sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation to a level higher than in the mesophyll. Questions remain regarding the mechanisms and selective advantages conferred by both of these symplastic-loading processes. Here, we present an integrated model—including local and global transport and kinetics of polymerization—for passive and active symplastic loading. We also propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With these models, we predict that (1) relative to passive loading, polymerization of Suc in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar content in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates export for a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">concentr</span></strong>ation of Suc in the mesophyll and (2) segregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can be achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher export rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to diffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to further studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of active and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering improved rates of export.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In addition, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in heat-induced TAG formation in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In addition, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG formation increases thermotolerance in addition to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

Higher Novel L-Cys Degradation Activity Results in Lower Organic-S and Biomass in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than the Related Saltwort, <i>Salicornia</i>
<p><i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i> are almost identical halophytes whose edible succulent shoots hold promise for commercial production in saline water. Enhanced sulfur nutrition may be beneficial to crops naturally grown on high sulfate. However, little is known about sulfate nutrition in halophytes. Here we show that <i>Salicornia europaea</i> (ecotype RN) exhibits a significant increase in biomass and organic-S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in response to supplemental sulfate, whereas <i>Sarcocornia fruticosa</i> (ecotype VM) does not, instead exhibiting increased sulfate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. We investigated the role of two pathways on organic-S and biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcoconia</i>: the sulfate reductive pathway that generates Cys and <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase that degrades Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, and pyruvate. The major function of <i>O</i>-acetyl-Ser-(thiol) lyase (OAS-TL; EC 2.5.1.47) is the formation of <sc>l</sc>-Cys, but our study shows that the OAS-TL A and OAS-TL B of both halophytes are enzymes that also degrade <sc>l</sc>-Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S. This activity was significantly higher in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than in <i>Salicornia</i>, especially upon sulfate supplementation. The activity of the sulfate reductive pathway key enzyme, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase (APR, EC 1.8.99.2), was significantly higher in <i>Salicornia</i> than in <i>Sarcocornia</i>. These results suggest that the low organic-S level in <i>Sarcocornia</i> is the result of high <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate by OAS-TLs, whereas the greater organic-S and biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in <i>Salicornia</i> is the result of higher APR activity and low <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate, resulting in higher net Cys biosynthesis. These results present an initial road map for halophyte growers to attain better growth rates and nutritional value of <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i>.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield potential.</p>

The DnaJ-Like Zinc-Finger Protein HCF222 Is Required for Thylakoid Membrane Biogenesis in Plants
<p>To understand the biogenesis of the thylakoid membrane in higher plants and to identify auxiliary proteins required to build up this highly complex membrane system, we have characterized the allelic nuclear mutants <i>high chlorophyll fluorescence222-1</i> (<i>hcf222-1</i>) and <i>hcf222-2</i> and isolated the causal gene by map-based cloning. In the ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant <i>hcf222-1</i>, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> (Cytb6f) complex was reduced to 30% compared with the wild type. Other thylakoid membrane complexes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated to normal levels. The T-DNA knockout mutant <i>hcf222-2</i> showed a more severe defect with respect to thylakoid membrane proteins and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated only 10% of the Cytb6f complex, accompanied by a reduction in photosystem II, the photosystem II light-harvesting complex, and photosystem I. <i>HCF222</i> encodes a protein of 99 amino acids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that has similarities to the cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain of DnaJ chaperones. The insulin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precipit</span></strong>ation assay demonstrated that HCF222 has disulfide reductase activity in vitro. The protein is conserved in higher plants and bryophytes but absent in algae and cyanobacteria. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that a fraction of HCF222-green fluorescent protein was detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum but that it also could be recognized in chloroplasts. A fusion construct of HCF222 containing a plastid transit peptide targets the protein into chloroplasts and was able to complement the mutational defect. These findings indicate that the chloroplast-targeted HCF222 is indispensable for the maturation and/or assembly of the Cytb6f complex and is very likely involved in thiol-disulfide biochemistry at the thylakoid membrane.</p>

Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate is a major source of GPCR-stimulated phosphoinositide production
<p>Phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes hydrolyze the plasma membrane (PM) lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>) to generate the second messengers inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in response to receptor activation in almost all mammalian cells. We previously found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in cardiac cells leads to the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the Golgi, a process required for the activation of nuclear protein kinase D (PKD) during cardiac hypertrophy. We hypothesized that GPCR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated PLC activation leading to direct PI4P hydrolysis may be a general mechanism for DAG production. We measured GPCR activation–dependent changes in PM and Golgi PI4P pools in various cells using GFP-based detection of PI4P. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation with various agonists caused a time-dependent reduction in PI4P-associated, but not PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>-associated, fluorescence at the Golgi and PM. Targeted depletion of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> from the PM before GPCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation had no effect on the depletion of PM or Golgi PI4P, total inositol phosphate (IP) production, or PKD activation. In contrast, acute depletion of PI4P specifically at the PM completely blocked the GPCR-dependent production of IPs and activation of PKD but did not change the abundance of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub>. Acute depletion of Golgi PI4P had no effect on these processes. These data suggest that most of the PM PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> pool is not involved in GPCR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that PI4P at the PM is responsible for the bulk of receptor-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and DAG production.</p>

Phosphorylation of the exocyst protein Exo84 by TBK1 promotes insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking
<p>Insulin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates glucose uptake through the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. The exocyst complex tethers GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, a process that requires the binding of the G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein) RalA to the exocyst complex. We report that upon activation of RalA, the protein kinase TBK1 phosphorylated the exocyst subunit Exo84. Knockdown of TBK1 blocked insulin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation; knockout of TBK1 in adipocytes blocked insulin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated glucose uptake; and ectopic overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 reduced insulin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The phosphorylation of Exo84 by TBK1 reduced its affinity for RalA and enabled its release from the exocyst. Overexpression of a kinase-inactive mutant of TBK1 blocked the dissociation of the TBK1/RalA/exocyst complex, and treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with specific inhibitors of TBK1 reduced the rate of complex dissociation. Introduction of phosphorylation-mimicking or nonphosphorylatable mutant forms of Exo84 blocked insulin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated GLUT4 translocation. Thus, these data indicate that TBK1 controls GLUT4 vesicle engagement and disengagement from the exocyst, suggesting that exocyst components not only constitute a tethering complex for the GLUT4 vesicle but also act as “gatekeepers” controlling vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane.</p>

Manifold roles of β-arrestins in GPCR signaling elucidated with siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) use diverse mechanisms to regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2. β-Arrestins (βArr1/2) are ubiquitous inhibitors of G protein signaling, promoting GPCR desensitization and internalization and serving as scaffolds for ERK1/2 activation. Studies using CRISPR/Cas9 to delete βArr1/2 and G proteins have cast doubt on the role of β-arrestins in activating specific pools of ERK1/2. We compared the effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of βArr1/2 and reconstitution with βArr1/2 in three different parental and CRISPR-derived βArr1/2 knockout HEK293 cell pairs to assess the effect of βArr1/2 deletion on ERK1/2 activation by four G<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs. In all parental lines with all receptors, ERK1/2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation was reduced by siRNAs specific for βArr2 or βArr1/2. In contrast, variable effects were observed with CRISPR-derived cell lines both between different lines and with activation of different receptors. For β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors (β<sub>2</sub>ARs) and β<sub>1</sub>ARs, βArr1/2 deletion increased, decreased, or had no effect on isoproterenol-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated ERK1/2 activation in different CRISPR clones. ERK1/2 activation by the vasopressin V<sub>2</sub> and follicle-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating hormone receptors was reduced in these cells but was enhanced by reconstitution with βArr1/2. Loss of desensitization and receptor internalization in CRISPR βArr1/2 knockout cells caused β<sub>2</sub>AR-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of ERK1/2 to become more dependent on G proteins, which was reversed by reintroducing βArr1/2. These data suggest that βArr1/2 function as a regulatory hub, determining the balance between mechanistically different pathways that result in activation of ERK1/2, and caution against extrapolating results obtained from βArr1/2- or G protein–deleted cells to GPCR behavior in native systems.</p>

Mechanisms of inside-out signaling of the high-affinity IgG receptor FcγRI
<p>Fc receptors (FcRs) are an important bridge between the innate and adaptive immune system. Fc gamma receptor I (FcγRI; CD64), the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin G (IgG), plays roles in inflammation, autoimmune responses, and immunotherapy. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of myeloid cells with cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor–α ( TNFα) and interferon-γ ( IFNγ), increases the binding of FcγRI to immune complexes (ICs), such as antibody-opsonized pathogens or tumor cells, through a process known as “inside-out” signaling. Using super-resolution imaging, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of cells with IL-3 also enhanced the clustering of FcγRI both before and after exposure to ICs. This increased clustering was dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton. We found that chemical inhibition of the activity of the phosphatase PP1 reduced FcγRI inside-out signaling, although the phosphorylation of FcγRI itself was unaffected. Furthermore, the antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity of human neutrophils toward CD20-expressing tumor cells was increased after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation with TNFα and IFNγ. These results suggest that nanoscale reorganization of FcγRI, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated by cytokine-induced, inside-out signaling, enhances FcγRI cellular effector functions.</p>

The interaction between IKKα and LC3 promotes type I interferon production through the TLR9-containing LAPosome
<p>Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes DNA in endosomes and activates distinct signaling pathways to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs). The assembly of signaling platforms on microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B–light chain 3 (LC3)–decorated endosomal vesicles is required to transduce TLR9 signals that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate the production of IFN but not interleukin-12 p40 (IL-12p40). LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), a form of noncanonical autophagy, is critical for the activation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and for IFN synthesis. We showed that after the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of TLR9 by CpG oligonucleotides, the autophagy protein LC3 and the kinase IKKα were recruited to endosomes that contained TLR9. The recruitment of IKKα and LC3 to such signaling endosomes was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated by catalysts of classical autophagosome formation but involved LAP formation, which required ATG5 but not FIP200. In addition, we found that the LC3-IKKα complex further associated with both TRAF3 and IRF7. We identified three putative LC3-interacting regions (LIRs) in IKKα, and mutagenesis suggested that two of these were critical for direct binding to LC3. Moreover, mutation of the same LIR sequences failed to rescue type I IFN production in IKKα-deficient dendritic cells upon reconstitution. Together, these data suggest a direct link between LAP formation and IKKα recruitment downstream of TLR9 activation that is necessary to facilitate type I IFN production.</p>

The intracellular pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase NT5C3A is a negative epigenetic factor in interferon and cytokine signaling
<p>The enzyme pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase (NT5C3A), which mediates nucleotide catabolism, was previously thought to be restricted to blood cells. We showed that expression of the gene encoding NT5C3A was induced by type I interferons (IFNs) in multiple cell types and that NT5C3A suppressed cytokine production through inhibition of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. <i>NT5C3A</i> expression required both an intronic IFN-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated response element and the IFN-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated transcription factor IRF1. Overexpression of NT5C3A, but not of its catalytic mutants, suppressed IL-8 production by HEK293 cells. Whereas knockdown of <i>NT5C3A</i> enhanced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated IL-8 production, it reduced the IFN-mediated suppression of <i>Il8</i> expression. Overexpression of <i>NT5C3A</i> increased the abundance of NAD<sup>+</sup> and the activation of the sirtuins SIRT1 and SIRT6, which are NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylases. NT5C3A-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated sirtuin activity resulted in deacetylation of histone H3 and the NF-κB subunit RelA (also known as p65), both of which were associated with the proximal region of the <i>Il8</i> promoter, thus repressing the transcription of <i>Il8</i>. Together, these data identify an anti-inflammatory pathway that depends on the catalytic activity of NT5C3A and functions as a negative feedback regulator of inflammatory cytokine signaling.</p>

Biased signaling by thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor–specific antibodies determines thyrocyte survival in autoimmunity
<p>The thyroid-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating hormone receptor (TSHR) is a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptor (GPCR). Autoimmune hyperthyroidism, commonly known as Graves’ disease (GD), is caused by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating autoantibodies to the TSHR. We previously described TSHR-specific antibodies (TSHR-Abs) in GD that recognize linear epitopes in the cleavage region of the TSHR ectodomain (C-TSHR-Abs) and induce thyroid cell apoptosis instead of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating the TSHR. We found that C-TSHR-Abs entered the cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis but did not trigger endosomal maturation and failed to undergo normal vesicular sorting and trafficking. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating TSHR-Abs (S-TSHR-Abs) activated Gα<sub>s</sub> and, to a lesser extent, Gα<sub>q</sub> but that C-TSHR-Abs failed to activate any of the G proteins normally activated in response to TSH. Furthermore, specific inhibition of G proteins in the presence of S-TSHR-mAbs or TSH resulted in a similar failure of endosomal maturation as that caused by C-TSHR-mAbs. Hence, whereas S-TSHR-mAbs and TSH contributed to normal vesicular trafficking of TSHR through the activation of major G proteins, the C-TSHR-Abs resulted in GRK2- and β-arrestin-1–dependent biased signaling, which is interpreted as a danger signal by the cell. Our observations suggest that the binding of antibodies to different TSHR epitopes may decrease cell survival. Antibody-induced cell injury and the response to cell death amplify the loss of self-tolerance, which most likely helps to perpetuate GPCR-mediated autoimmunity.</p>

The tyrosine kinase Src promotes phosphorylation of the kinase TBK1 to facilitate type I interferon production after viral infection
<p>Various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are activated in response to viral infection to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate the production of type I interferons (IFNs). However, central to the responses of all of these receptors is their activation of the kinase TBK1, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates transcription by IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). We investigated the mechanism by which the kinase activity of TBK1 is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated in response to viral infection. We found that the tyrosine kinase Src promoted the phosphorylation of TBK1 on Tyr<sup>179</sup> upon viral infection of RAW264.7 macrophages. Mutation of Tyr<sup>179</sup> to alanine resulted in impaired autophosphorylation of TBK1 at Ser<sup>172</sup>, which is required for TBK1 activation. The TBK1 Y179A mutant failed to rescue type I IFN production by virally infected RAW264.7 macrophages deficient in TBK1. Pharmacological inhibition of Src with AZD0530 and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9–mediated knockout of Src demonstrated that Src was critical for activating the TBK1-IRF3 pathway and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating type I IFN production. However, Src did not directly bind to recombinant TBK1 in vitro but instead bound to the proline-X-X-proline motifs within key PRR adaptor proteins, such as TRIF, MAVS, and STING, which formed complexes with TBK1 after PRR engagement. Together, our data suggest that Src is the major tyrosine kinase that primes TBK1 for autophosphorylation and activation, thus providing mechanistic insights into the regulation of TBK1 activity by various PRRs as part of the innate antiviral response.</p>

Conversion of object identity to object-general semantic value in the primate temporal cortex

Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements
<p>Fundamental questions remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models.

A considerable fraction of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion involves ions, but the relatively weak dependence on ion concentrations indicates that for the processes studied, variations in cosmic ray intensity do not appreciably affect climate through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion in the present-day atmosphere.</p>

CRAC channels regulate astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and gliotransmitter release to modulate hippocampal GABAergic transmission
<p>Astrocytes are the major glial subtype in the b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rain</span></strong> and mediate numerous functions ranging from metabolic support to gliotransmitter release through signaling mechanisms controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Despite intense interest, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx pathways in astrocytes remain obscure, hindering mechanistic insights into how Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is coupled to downstream astrocyte-mediated effector functions.

Inhibition of T cell activation and function by the adaptor protein CIN85
<p>T cell activation is initiated by signaling molecules downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR) that are organized by adaptor proteins.

Compared to activated wild-type (WT) T cells, those that lacked CIN85 produced more IL-2 and exhibited greater proliferation.

A coupled-clock system drives the automaticity of human sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells
<p>The spontaneous rhythmic action potentials generated by the sinoatrial node (SAN), the primary pacemaker in the heart, dictate the regular and optimal cardiac contractions that pump blood around the body. Although the heart rate of humans is substantially slower than that of smaller experimental animals, current perspectives on the biophysical mechanisms underlying the automaticity of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells (SANCs) have been gleaned largely from studies of animal hearts. Using human SANCs, we demonstrated that spontaneous rhythmic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases generated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> clock were coupled to electrogenic surface membrane molecules (the M clock) to trigger rhythmic action potentials, and that Ca<sup>2+</sup>–cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling regulated clock coupling. When these clocks became uncoupled, SANCs failed to generate spontaneous action potentials, showing a depolarized membrane potential and disorganized local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases that failed to activate the M clock. β-Adrenergic receptor (β-AR) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation, which increases cAMP concentrations and clock coupling in other species, restored spontaneous, rhythmic action potentials in some nonbeating “arrested” human SANCs by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and synchronizing diastolic local Ca<sup>2+</sup> releases. When β-AR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation was withdrawn, the clocks again became uncoupled, and SANCs reverted to a nonbeating arrested state. Thus, automaticity of human pacemaker cells is driven by a coupled-clock system driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling. Extreme clock uncoupling led to failure of spontaneous action potential generation, which was restored by recoupling of the clocks. Clock coupling and action potential firing in some of these arrested cells can be restored by β-AR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation–induced augmentation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-cAMP-PKA signaling.</p>

IL-2Rβ abundance differentially tunes IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells
<p>Interleukin-2 (IL-2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates both activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to proliferate. IL-2 signals through an identical receptor complex and promotes the same dose-dependent phosphorylation of the canonical transcription factor STAT5 in both cell types. Despite this, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells enter the S phase earlier and proliferate to a greater extent than do CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to IL-2. We identified distinct IL-2 signaling dynamics in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In IL-2–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, STAT5 phosphorylation increased rapidly and was sustained for 6 hours. In contrast, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had a biphasic response, with maxima at 15 min and 2 to 4 hours after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation. Both cell types required vesicular trafficking, but only CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells required new protein synthesis to maintain high phosphorylation of STAT5. Two subunits of the IL-2 receptor, IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, were twice as abundant in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells than in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Reduction of IL-2Rβ abundance by 50% was sufficient to convert CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to a CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell–like signaling pattern and delay S phase entry. These results suggest that the larger pool of IL-2Rβ chains in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is required to sustain IL-2 signaling and contributes to the quantitatively greater proliferative response to IL-2 relative to that of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This cell type–specific difference in IL-2Rβ abundance appears to tune responses, potentially preventing extensive, autoimmune proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, while still enabling sufficient proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to control viral infections.</p>

ATP promotes the fast migration of dendritic cells through the activity of pannexin 1 channels and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors
<p>Upon its release from injured cells, such as infected, transformed, inflamed, or necrotic cells, extracellular adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) acts as a danger signal that recruits phagocytes, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), to the site of injury. The sensing of extracellular ATP occurs through purinergic (P2) receptors. We investigated the cellular mechanisms linking purinergic signaling to DC motility. We found that ATP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated fast DC motility through an autocrine signaling loop, which was initiated by the activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and further amplified by pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels. Upon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor by ATP, Panx1 contributed to fast DC motility by increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane, which resulted in supplementary ATP release. In the absence of Panx1, DCs failed to increase their speed of migration in response to ATP, despite exhibiting a normal P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. In addition to DC migration, Panx1 channel– and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–dependent signaling was further required to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In vivo, functional Panx1 channels were required for the homing of DCs to lymph nodes, although they were dispensable for DC maturation. These data suggest that P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and Panx1 channels are crucial players in the regulation of DC migration to endogenous danger signals.</p>

TCR-stimulated changes in cell surface CD46 expression generate type 1 regulatory T cells
<p>A lack of regulatory T cell function is a critical factor in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Ligation of the complement regulatory protein CD46 facilitates the differentiation of T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1) effector cells into interleukin-10 (IL-10)–secreting type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells), and this pathway is defective in MS patients. Cleavage of the ectodomain of CD46, which contains three N-glycosylation sites and multiple O-glycosylation sites, enables CD46 to activate T cells. We found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of the T cell receptor (TCR)–CD3 complex was associated with a reduction in the apparent molecular mass of CD46 in a manner that depended on O-glycosylation. CD3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated changes in CD46 O-glycosylation status reduced CD46 processing and subsequent T cell signaling. During T cell activation, CD46 was recruited to the immune synapse in a manner that required its serine-, threonine-, and proline-rich (STP) region, which is rich in O-glycosylation sites. Recruitment of CD46 to the immune synapse switched T cells from producing the inflammatory cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to producing IL-10. Furthermore, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from MS patients did not exhibit a CD3-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated reduction in the mass of CD46 and thus showed increased amounts of cell surface CD46. Together, these data suggest a possible mechanism underlying the regulatory function of CD46 on T cells. Our findings may explain why this pathway is defective in patients with MS and provide insights into MS pathogenesis that could help to design future immunotherapies.</p>

Identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of type 1 adenylyl cyclase activity with analgesic properties
<p>Adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) belongs to a group of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) that are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated by calcium in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Studies with AC1 knockout mice suggest that inhibitors of AC1 may be useful for treating pain and opioid dependence. However, nonselective inhibition of AC isoforms could result in substantial adverse effects. We used chemical library screening to identify a selective AC1 inhibitor with a chromone core structure that may represent a new analgesic agent. After demonstrating that the compound (ST034307) inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably transfected with AC1 (HEK-AC1 cells), we confirmed selectivity for AC1 by testing against all isoforms of membrane-bound ACs. ST034307 also inhibited AC1 activity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated by forskolin- and Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors in HEK-AC1 cells and showed inhibitory activity in multiple AC1-containing membrane preparations and mouse hippocampal homogenates. ST034307 enhanced μ-opioid receptor (MOR)–mediated inhibition of AC1 in short-term inhibition assays in HEK-AC1 cells stably transfected with MOR; however, the compound blocked heterologous sensitization of AC1 caused by chronic MOR activation in these cells. ST034307 reduced pain responses in a mouse model of inflammatory pain. Our data indicate that ST034307 is a selective small-molecule inhibitor of AC1 and suggest that selective AC1 inhibitors may be useful for managing pain.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p>Spin-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply spin coating either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the spin-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during spin coating promotes heterogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion on the surface.

Reducing the stochasticity of crystal nucleation to enable subnanosecond memory writing
<p>Operation speed is a key challenge in phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory. Commercialized PCRAM products are limited by the tens of nanoseconds writing speed, originating from the stochastic crystal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion during the crystallization of amorphous germanium antimony telluride<i> </i>(Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>).

The scandium antimony telluride (Sc<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) compound that we designed allows a writing speed of only 700 picoseconds without preprogramming in a large conventional PCRAM device. This ultrafast crystallization stems from the reduced stochasticity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize crystal precursors in the amorphous state.

Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive
<p>Water deprivation produces a drive to seek and consume water. How neural activity creates this motivation remains poorly understood. We used activity-dependent genetic labeling to characterize neurons activated by water deprivation in the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-activated MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these neurons, mice drank water and performed an operant lever-pressing task for water reward with rates that scaled with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation frequency.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Giberellic Acid-Stimulated Transcript Proteins Evolved through Successive Conjugation of Novel Motifs and Their Subfunctionalization
<p><i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript</i> (<i>GAST</i>)-like genes encode small polypeptides, some of which have been implicated in diverse biological processes regulating plant growth and development. However, the occurrence of GASTs among plants, their protein structures, and the mechanisms by which they evolved remain elusive. Here, using a customized workflow, we report genes encoding GAST proteins, identify novel motifs and evolutionary patterns contributing to the subfunctionalization of GAST domains, and explore functional conservation across diverse plant groups. We show that <i>GAST</i>-like sequences evolved initially in the vascular plant <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i>, after the divergence from bryophytes, and later emerged in gymnosperms and angiosperms. GASTs in angiosperms are characterized by four conserved novel motifs; however, relatively fewer conserved motifs exist in pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GAST-Cysteine Rich1 motif evolved early in the <i>S. moellendorffii</i> GAST, which further acquired subfunctionalization through successive conjugation of other motifs and remained conserved across plants, as supported by their collinearity. Functional characterization of two orthologs from the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated Arabidopsis 10</i>) and the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-Related 9</i>) suggests hormonal regulation, novel roles in seed germination, and functional conservation among diverse plant groups. Computational modeling predicts that these <i>GAST</i> genes are regulated by several factors, including the phytohormones gibberellin and abscisic acid, through conserved cis-motifs present in their promoters, and that they might act as signaling molecules in a complex feedback loop. Thus, our study identifies <i>GAST</i>s and their encoded proteins, uncovers their structure, novel motifs, and evolutionary pattern among plants, and suggests their functional conservation.</p>

This was associated with higher DC and T-cell counts in pericardial AT, which outnumbered DCs and T cells in lymph nodes.

Conversely, macrophages deficient in functional MC1-R displayed a phenotype with impaired efflux and enhanced uptake of cholesterol.

In silico modeling identifies CD45 as a regulator of IL-2 synergy in the NKG2D-mediated activation of immature human NK cells
<p>Natural killer (NK) cells perform immunosurveillance of virally infected and transformed cells, and their activation depends on the balance between signaling by inhibitory and activating receptors. Cytokine receptor signaling can synergize with activating receptor signaling to induce NK cell activation. We investigated the interplay between the signaling pathways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated by the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the activating receptor NKG2D in immature (CD56<sup>bright</sup>) and mature (CD56<sup>dim</sup>) subsets of human primary NK cells using mass cytometry experiments and in silico modeling. Our analysis revealed that IL-2 changed the abundances of several key proteins, including NKG2D and the phosphatase CD45. Furthermore, we found differences in correlations between protein abundances, which were associated with the maturation state of the NK cells. The mass cytometry measurements also revealed that the signaling kinetics of key protein abundances induced by NKG2D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation depended on the maturation state and the pretreatment condition of the NK cells. Our in silico model, which described the multidimensional data with coupled first-order reactions, predicted that the increase in CD45 abundance was a major enhancer of NKG2D-mediated activation in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells but not in IL-2–treated CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells. This dependence on CD45 was verified by measurement of CD107a mobilization to the NK cell surface (a marker of activation). Our mathematical framework can be used to glean mechanisms underlying synergistic signaling pathways in other activated immune cells.</p>

Ligand- and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels differentially regulate the mode of vesicular neuropeptide release in mammalian sensory neurons
<p>Neuropeptides released from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons play essential roles in the neurotransmission of sensory inputs, including those underlying nociception and pathological pain. Neuropeptides are released from intracellular vesicles through two modes: a partial release mode called “kiss-and-run” (KAR) and a full release mode called “full fusion–like” (FFL). Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we traced the release of pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein–tagged neuropeptide Y (pHluorin-NPY) from individual dense-core vesicles in the soma and axon of single DRG neurons after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through either voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) or ligand-gated transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through VGCCs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated FFL and a greater single release of neuropeptides. In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through TRPV1 channels <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated KAR and a pulsed but prolonged release of neuropeptides that was partially mediated by Dynamin 1, which limits fusion pore expansion. Suppressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient to an extent similar to that seen after TRPV1 activation abolished the VGCC preference for FFL. The findings suggest that by generating a steeper Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient, VGCCs promote a more robust fusion pore opening that facilitates FFL. Thus, KAR and FFL release modes are differentially regulated by the two principal types of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels in DRG neurons.</p>

Membrane depolarization activates BK channels through ROCK-mediated β1 subunit surface trafficking to limit vasoconstriction
<p>Membrane depolarization of smooth muscle cells (myocytes) in the small arteries that regulate regional organ blood flow leads to vasoconstriction. Membrane depolarization also activates large-conductance calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)–activated potassium (BK) channels, which limits Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity that promotes vasoconstriction, thus leading to vasodilation. We showed that in human and rat arterial myocytes, membrane depolarization rapidly increased the cell surface abundance of auxiliary BK β1 subunits but not that of the pore-forming BKα channels. Membrane depolarization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the activation of Rho kinase (ROCK) 1 and 2.

The kinase TPL2 activates ERK and p38 signaling to promote neutrophilic inflammation
<p>Tumor progression locus 2 (TPL2; also known as MAP3K8) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MAP3K) that phosphorylates the MAPK kinases MEK1 and MEK2 (MEK1/2), which, in turn, activate the MAPKs extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2 (ERK1/2) in macrophages <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated through the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), or the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR). We describe a conserved and critical role for TPL2 in mediating the effector functions of neutrophils through the activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Gene expression profiling and functional studies of neutrophils and monocytes revealed a MEK1/2-independent branch point downstream of TPL2 in neutrophils. Biochemical analyses identified the MAPK kinases MEK3 and MEK6 and the MAPKs p38α and p38δ as downstream effectors of TPL2 in these cells. Genetic ablation of the catalytic activity of TPL2 or therapeutic intervention with a TPL2-specific inhibitor reduced the production of inflammatory mediators by neutrophils in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation with the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro, as well as in rodent models of inflammatory disease. Together, these data suggest that TPL2 is a drug target that activates not only MEK1/2-dependent but also MEK3/6-dependent signaling to promote inflammatory responses.</p>

Structural basis for chemokine recognition by a G protein–coupled receptor and implications for receptor activation
<p>Chemokines orchestrate cell migration for development, immune surveillance, and disease by binding to cell surface heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptors (GPCRs). The array of interactions between the nearly 50 chemokines and their 20 GPCR targets generates an extensive signaling network to which promiscuity and biased agonism add further complexity. The receptor CXCR4 recognizes both monomeric and dimeric forms of the chemokine CXCL12, which is a distinct example of ligand bias in the chemokine family. We demonstrated that a constitutively monomeric CXCL12 variant reproduced the G protein–dependent and β-arrestin–dependent responses that are associated with normal CXCR4 signaling and lead to cell migration. In addition, monomeric CXCL12 made specific contacts with CXCR4 that are not present in the structure of the receptor in complex with a dimeric form of CXCL12, a biased agonist that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates only G protein–dependent signaling. We produced an experimentally validated model of an agonist-bound chemokine receptor that merged a nuclear magnetic resonance–based structure of monomeric CXCL12 bound to the amino terminus of CXCR4 with a crystal structure of the transmembrane domains of CXCR4. The large CXCL12:CXCR4 protein-protein interface revealed by this structure identified previously uncharacterized functional interactions that fall outside of the classical “two-site model” for chemokine-receptor recognition. Our model suggests a mechanistic hypothesis for how interactions on the extracellular face of the receptor may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate the conformational changes required for chemokine receptor–mediated signal transduction.</p>

Bcl9 and Bcl9l are tissue-specific transcriptional cofactors that cooperate with β-catenin. In the nucleus, Bcl9 and Bcl9l simultaneously bind β-catenin and the transcriptional activator Pygo2 to promote the transcription of a subset of Wnt target genes. We showed that Bcl9 and Bcl9l function in the cytoplasm during tooth enamel formation in a manner that is independent of Wnt-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated β-catenin–dependent transcription. Bcl9, Bcl9l, and Pygo2 localized mainly to the cytoplasm of the epithelial-derived ameloblasts, the cells responsible for enamel production. In ameloblasts, Bcl9 interacted with proteins involved in enamel formation and proteins involved in exocytosis and vesicular trafficking. Conditional deletion of both Bcl9 and Bcl9l or both Pygo1 and Pygo2 in mice produced teeth with defective enamel that was bright white and deficient in iron, which is reminiscent of human tooth enamel pathologies. Overall, our data revealed that these proteins, originally defined through their function as β-catenin transcriptional cofactors, function in odontogenesis through a previously uncharacterized cytoplasmic mechanism, revealing that they have roles beyond that of transcriptional cofactors.</p>

De novo phosphorylation and conformational opening of the tyrosine kinase Lck act in concert to initiate T cell receptor signaling
<p>The enzymatic activity of the Src family tyrosine kinase p56<sup>Lck</sup> (Lck) is tightly controlled by differential phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues, Tyr<sup>394</sup> and Tyr<sup>505</sup>. Phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>394</sup> and the conformational opening of Lck are believed to activate the kinase, whereas Tyr<sup>505</sup> phosphorylation is thought to generate a closed, inactive conformation of Lck. We investigated whether the conformation of Lck and its phosphorylation state act in concert to regulate the initiation of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. With a sensitive biosensor, we used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to investigate the conformations of wild-type Lck and its phosphorylation-deficient mutants Y394F and Y505F and the double mutant Y394F/Y505F in un<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated T cells and after TCR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation. With this approach, we separated the conformational changes of Lck from the phosphorylation state of its regulatory tyrosines. We showed that the conformational opening of Lck alone was insufficient to initiate signaling events in T cells. Rather, Lck additionally required phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>394</sup> to induce T cell activation. Consistent with the FLIM measurements, an optimized immunofluorescence microscopy protocol revealed that the TCR-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated phosphorylation of Lck at Tyr<sup>394</sup> occurred preferentially at the plasma membrane of Jurkat cells and primary human T cells. Our study supports the hypothesis that T cell activation through the TCR complex is accompanied by the de novo activation of Lck and that phosphorylation of Tyr<sup>394</sup> plays a role in Lck function that goes beyond inducing an open conformation of the kinase.</p>

Direct stimulation of NADP<sup>+</sup> synthesis through Akt-mediated phosphorylation of NAD kinase
<p>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP<sup>+</sup>) is essential for producing NADPH, the primary cofactor for reductive metabolism. We find that growth factor signaling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt pathway induces acute synthesis of NADP<sup>+</sup> and NADPH. Akt phosphorylates NAD kinase (NADK), the sole cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of NADP<sup>+</sup> from NAD<sup>+</sup> (the oxidized form of NADH), on three serine residues (Ser<sup>44</sup>, Ser<sup>46</sup>, and Ser<sup>48</sup>) within an amino-terminal domain. This phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates NADK activity both in cells and directly in vitro, thereby increasing NADP<sup>+</sup> production. A rare isoform of NADK (isoform 3) lacking this regulatory region exhibits constitutively increased activity. These data indicate that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of NADK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates its activity to increase NADP<sup>+</sup> production through relief of an autoinhibitory function inherent to its amino terminus.</p>

Intense threat switches dorsal raphe serotonin neurons to a paradoxical operational mode
<p>Survival depends on the selection of behaviors adaptive for the current environment. For example, a mouse should run from a rapidly looming hawk but should freeze if the hawk is coasting across the sky. Although serotonin has been implicated in adaptive behavior, environmental regulation of its functional role remains poorly understood. In mice, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons suppressed movement in low- and moderate-threat environments but induced escape behavior in high-threat environments, and that movement-related dorsal raphe serotonin neural dynamics inverted in high-threat environments. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of dorsal raphe γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons promoted movement in negative but not positive environments, and movement-related GABA neural dynamics inverted between positive and negative environments. Thus, dorsal raphe circuits switch between distinct operational modes to promote environment-specific adaptive behaviors.</p>

Flagellar microtubule doublet assembly in vitro reveals a regulatory role of tubulin C-terminal tails
<p>Microtubule doublets (MTDs), consisting of an incomplete B-microtubule at the surface of a complete A-microtubule, provide a structural scaffold mediating intraflagellar transport and ciliary beating. Despite the fundamental role of MTDs, the molecular mechanism governing their formation is unknown. We used a cell-free assay to demonstrate a crucial inhibitory role of the carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) tail of tubulin in MTD assembly. Removal of the C-terminal tail of an assembled A-microtubule allowed for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion of a B-microtubule on its surface. C-terminal tails of only one A-microtubule protofilament inhibited this side-to-surface tubulin interaction, which would be overcome in vivo with binding protein partners. The dynamics of B-microtubule <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion and its distinctive isotropic elongation was elucidated by using live imaging. Thus, inherent interaction properties of tubulin provide a structural basis driving flagellar MTD assembly.</p>

Evidence for a neural law of effect
<p>Thorndike’s law of effect states that actions that lead to reinforcements tend to be repeated more often. Accordingly, neural activity patterns leading to reinforcement are also reentered more frequently. Reinforcement relies on dopaminergic activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and animals shape their behavior to receive dopaminergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation. Seeking evidence for a neural law of effect, we found that mice learn to reenter more frequently motor cortical activity patterns that trigger optogenetic VTA self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation. Learning was accompanied by gradual shaping of these patterns, with participating neurons progressively increasing and aligning their covariance to that of the target pattern. Motor cortex patterns that lead to phasic dopaminergic VTA activity are progressively reinforced and shaped, suggesting a mechanism by which animals select and shape actions to reliably achieve reinforcement.</p>

Defective cholesterol clearance limits remyelination in the aged central nervous system
<p>Age-associated decline in regeneration capacity limits the restoration of nervous system functionality after injury. In a model for demyelination, we found that old mice fail to resolve the inflammatory response initiated after myelin damage. Aged phagocytes accumulated excessive amounts of myelin debris, which triggered cholesterol crystal formation and phagolysosomal membrane rupture and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated inflammasomes. Myelin debris clearance required cholesterol transporters, including apolipoprotein E. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of reverse cholesterol transport was sufficient to restore the capacity of old mice to remyelinate lesioned tissue. Thus, cholesterol-rich myelin debris can overwhelm the efflux capacity of phagocytes, resulting in a phase transition of cholesterol into crystals and thereby inducing a maladaptive immune response that impedes tissue regeneration.</p>

Toward an optically controlled brain
<p>Neurons can be modified with light-gated ion channels, which cause them to become excited upon illumination (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). This discovery has given rise to the field of optogenetics, with impressive examples such as triggering the beat of a heart with light (<i>3</i>). There is, however, one technical limitation: Light-gated ion channels are typically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated with blue-green light, which is heavily scattered by tissue. Thus, deep b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rain</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation, focused on small regions, is a major challenge. On page 679 of this issue, Chen <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) use transgenic mice implanted with upconverting nanoparticles (NPs) to locally activate light-gated ion channels and modulate neuronal activity, even deep inside the b<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rain</span></strong>. This method might eventually lead the way for clinical applications to optically control neuronal dysfunctions, such as Parkinson's disease or even paralysis.</p>

Distinct phases of Polycomb silencing to hold epigenetic memory of cold in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<p>Gene silencing by Polycomb complexes is central to eukaryotic development. Cold-induced epigenetic repression of <i>FLOWERING LOCUS C</i> (<i>FLC</i>) in the plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> provides an opportunity to study initiation and maintenance of Polycomb silencing. Here, we show that a subset of Polycomb repressive complex 2 factors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>e silencing in a small region within <i>FLC</i>, locally increasing H3K27me3 levels. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion confers a silenced state that is metastably inherited, with memory held in the local chromatin. Metastable memory is then converted to stable epigenetic silencing through separate Polycomb factors, which spread across the locus after cold to enlarge the domain that contains H3K27me3. Polycomb silencing at <i>FLC</i> thus has mechanistically distinct phases, which involve specialization of distinct Polycomb components to deliver first metastable then long-term epigenetic silencing.</p>

Activity-dependent spatially localized miRNA maturation in neuronal dendrites
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and preventing their translation. In general, the number of potential mRNA targets in a cell is much greater than the miRNA copy number, complicating high-fidelity miRNA-target interactions. We developed an inducible fluorescent probe to explore whether the maturation of a miRNA could be regulated in space and time in neurons. A precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) probe exhibited an activity-dependent increase in fluorescence, suggesting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of miRNA maturation. Single-synapse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation resulted in a local maturation of miRNA that was associated with a spatially restricted reduction in the protein synthesis of a target mRNA. Thus, the spatially and temporally regulated maturation of pre-miRNAs can be used to increase the precision and robustness of miRNA-mediated translational repression.</p>

Active sites in heterogeneous ice nucleation—the example of K-rich feldspars
<p>Ice formation on aerosol particles is a process of crucial importance to Earth’s climate and the environmental sciences, but it is not understood at the molecular level. This is partly because the nature of active sites, local surface features where ice growth commences, is still unclear. Here we report direct electron-microscopic observations of deposition growth of aligned ice crystals on feldspar, an atmospherically important component of mineral dust. Our molecular-scale computer simulations indicate that this alignment arises from the preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion of prismatic crystal planes of ice on high-energy (100) surface planes of feldspar. The microscopic patches of (100) surface, exposed at surface defects such as steps, cracks, and cavities, are thought to be responsible for the high ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ion efficacy of potassium (K)–feldspar particles.</p>

β-cell–mimetic designer cells provide closed-loop glycemic control
<p>Chronically deregulated blood-glucose concentrations in diabetes mellitus result from a loss of pancreatic insulin-producing β cells (type 1 diabetes, T1D) or from impaired insulin sensitivity of body cells and glucose-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated insulin release (type 2 diabetes, T2D). Here, we show that therapeutically applicable β-cell–mimetic designer cells can be established by minimal engineering of human cells. We achieved glucose responsiveness by a synthetic circuit that couples glycolysis-mediated calcium entry to an excitation-transcription system controlling therapeutic transgene expression. Implanted circuit-carrying cells corrected insulin deficiency and self-sufficiently abolished persistent hyperglycemia in T1D mice. Similarly, glucose-inducible glucagon-like peptide 1 transcription improved endogenous glucose-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated insulin release and glucose tolerance in T2D mice. These systems may enable a combination of diagnosis and treatment for diabetes mellitus therapy.</p>

Rapid Hebbian axonal remodeling mediated by visual stimulation
<p>We examined how correlated firing controls axon remodeling, using in vivo time-lapse imaging and electrophysiological analysis of individual retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons that were visually <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated either synchronously or asynchronously relative to neighboring inputs in the <i>Xenopus laevis</i> optic tectum. RGCs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated out of synchrony rapidly lost the ability to drive tectal postsynaptic partners while their axons grew and added many new branches. In contrast, synchronously activated RGCs produced fewer new branches, but these were more stable. The effects of synchronous activation were prevented by the inhibition of neurotransmitter release and <i>N</i>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) blockade, which is consistent with a role for synaptic NMDAR activation in the stabilization of axonal branches and suppression of further exploratory branch addition.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Variation in Leaf Respiration Rates at Night Correlates with Carbohydrate and Amino Acid Supply
<p>Plant respiration can theoretically be fueled by and dependent upon an array of central metabolism components; however, which ones are responsible for the quantitative variation found in respiratory rates is unknown. Here, large-scale screens revealed 2-fold variation in nighttime leaf respiration rate (R<sub>N</sub>) among mature leaves from an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) natural accession collection grown under common favorable conditions. R<sub>N</sub> variation was mostly maintained in the absence of genetic variation, which emphasized the low heritability of R<sub>N</sub> and its plasticity toward relatively small environmental differences within the sampling regime. To pursue metabolic explanations for leaf R<sub>N</sub> variation, parallel metabolite level profiling and assays of total protein and starch were performed. Within an accession, R<sub>N</sub> correlated strongly with stored carbon substrates, including starch and dicarboxylic acids, as well as sucrose, major amino acids, shikimate, and salicylic acid. Among different accessions, metabolite-R<sub>N</sub> correlations were maintained with protein, sucrose, and major amino acids but not stored carbon substrates. A complementary screen of the effect of exogenous metabolites and effectors on leaf R<sub>N</sub> revealed that (1) R<sub>N</sub> is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ated by the uncoupler FCCP and high levels of substrates, demonstrating that both adenylate turnover and substrate supply can limit leaf R<sub>N</sub>, and (2) inorganic nitrogen did not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ate R<sub>N</sub>, consistent with limited nighttime nitrogen assimilation. Simultaneous measurements of R<sub>N</sub> and protein synthesis revealed that these processes were largely uncorrelated in mature leaves. These results indicate that differences in preceding daytime metabolic activities are the major source of variation in mature leaf R<sub>N</sub> under favorable controlled conditions.</p>

Reduction of blood oxygen levels enhances postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in Burmese python (<i>Python bivittatus</i>)
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is characterized by reversible enlargement of cardiomyocytes and changes in chamber architecture, which increase stroke volume and [Formula] via augmented convective oxygen transport. Cardiac hypertrophy is known to occur in response to repeated elevations of O<sub>2</sub> demand and/or reduced O<sub>2</sub> supply in several species of vertebrate ectotherms, including postprandial Burmese pythons (<i>Python bivittatus</i>). Recent data suggest postprandial cardiac hypertrophy in <i>P. bivittatus</i> is a facultative rather than obligatory response to digestion, though the triggers of this response are unknown. Here, we hypothesized that an O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ates postprandial cardiac enlargement in Burmese pythons. To test this hypothesis, we rendered animals anemic prior to feeding, essentially halving blood oxygen content during the postprandial period. Fed anemic animals had heart rates 126% higher than those of fasted controls, which, coupled with a 71% increase in mean arterial pressure, suggests fed anemic animals were experiencing significantly elevated cardiac work. We found significant cardiac hypertrophy in fed anemic animals, which exhibited ventricles 39% larger than those of fasted controls and 28% larger than in fed controls. These findings support our hypothesis that those animals with a greater magnitude of O<sub>2</sub> supply–demand mismatch exhibit the largest hearts. The ‘low O<sub>2</sub> signal’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ating postprandial cardiac hypertrophy is likely mediated by elevated ventricular wall stress associated with postprandial hemodynamics.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium ion current induced by muscarinic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rain</span></strong>bow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by application of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrations (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions and distinct current–voltage relationship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the sodium–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclusion of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfusion with K<sup>+</sup>-free solution. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solution. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stimul</span></strong>ation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activation, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervation.</p>

Antifreeze proteins in the primary urine of larvae of the beetle <i>Dendroides canadensis</i>
<p>To avoid freezing while overwintering beneath the bark of fallen trees, <i>Dendroides canadensis</i> (Coleoptera: Pyrochroidae) larvae produce a family of antifreeze proteins (DAFPs) that are transcribed in specific tissues and have specific compartmental fates. DAFPs and associated thermal hysteresis activity (THA) have been shown previously in hemolymph and midgut fluid, but the presence of DAFPs has not been explored in primary urine, a potentially important site that can contain endogenous ice-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ing compounds that could induce freezing. A maximum mean THA of 2.65±0.33°C was observed in primary urine of winter-collected <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae. THA in primary urine increased significantly through autumn, peaked in the winter and decreased through spring to levels of 0.2–0.3°C in summer, in a pattern similar to that of hemolymph and midgut fluid. THA was also found in hindgut fluid and excreted rectal fluid, suggesting that these larvae not only concentrate AFPs in the hindgut, but also excrete AFPs from the rectal cavity. Based on <i>dafp</i> transcripts isolated from Malpighian tubule epithelia, cDNAs were cloned and sequenced, identifying the presence of transcripts encoding 24 DAFP isoforms. Six of these Malpighian tubule DAFPs were known previously, but 18 are new. We also provide functional evidence that DAFPs can inhibit ice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nucleat</span></strong>ors present in insect primary urine. This is potentially critical because <i>D. canadensis</i> larvae die if frozen, and therefore ice formation in any body fluid, including the urine, would be lethal.</p>

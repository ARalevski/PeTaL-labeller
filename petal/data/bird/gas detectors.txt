Subclinical Atrial Fibrillation in Older Patients
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Long-term continuous electrocardiographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing shows a substantial prevalence of asymptomatic, subclinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF) in patients with pacemakers and patients with cryptogenic stroke. Whether SCAF is also common in other patients without these conditions is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We implanted subcutaneous electrocardiographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>s (St. Jude CONFIRM-AF) in patients ≥65 years of age attending cardiovascular or neurology outpatient clinics if they had no history of atrial fibrillation but had any of the following: CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of ≥2, sleep apnea, or body mass index >30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Eligibility also required either left atrial enlargement (≥4.4 cm or volume ≥58 mL) or increased (≥290 pg/mL) serum NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide). Patients were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ed for SCAF lasting ≥5 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Two hundred fifty-six patients were followed up for 16.3±3.8 months. Baseline age was 74±6 years; mean CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score was 4.1±1.4; left atrial diameter averaged 4.7±0.8 cm; and 48% had a prior stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism. SCAF ≥5 minutes was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed in 90 patients (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion rate, 34.4%/y; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27.7–42.3). Baseline predictors of SCAF were increased age (hazard ratio [HR] per decade, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.11–2.15), left atrial dimension (HR per centimeter diameter, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.09–1.86), and blood pressure (HR per 10 mm Hg, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78–0.98), but not prior stroke. The rate of occurrence of SCAF in those with a history of stroke, systemic embolism, or transient ischemic attack was 39.4%/y versus 30.3%/y without (<i>P</i>=0.32). The cumulative SCAF <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion rate was higher (51.9%/y) in those with left atrial volume above the median value of 73.5 mL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>SCAF is frequently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed by continuous electrocardiographic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing in older patients without a history of atrial fibrillation who are attending outpatient cardiology and neurology clinics.

Tree Physiology
An empirical study of the wound effect on sap flux density measured with thermal dissipation probes
<p>The insertion of thermal dissipation (TD) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s on tree stems for sap flux density (SFD) measurements can lead to SFD underestimations due to a wound formation close to the drill hole. However, the wound effect has not been assessed experimentally for this method yet. Here, we propose an empirical approach to investigate the effect of the wound healing on measured sap flux with TD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">probe</span></strong>s. The approach was performed for both, diffuse-porous (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> (Linnaeus)) and ring-porous (<i>Quercus petraea</i> (Lieblein)) species. Thermal dissipation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">probe</span></strong>s were installed on different dates along the growing season to document the effects of the dynamic wound formation. The trees were cut in autumn and additional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s were installed in the cut stems, therefore, without potential effects of wound development. A range of water pressures was applied to the stem segments and SFDs were simultaneously measured by TD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s as well as gravimetrically in the laboratory. The formation of wounds around <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s installed in living tree stems led to underestimation of SFD by 21.4 ± 3 and 47.5 ± 3.8% in beech and oak, respectively. The differences between SFD underestimations of diffuse-porous beech and ring-porous oak were, however, not statistically significant. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s with 5-, 11- and 22-week-old wounds also showed no significant differences, which implies that the influence of wound formation on SFD estimates was completed within the first few weeks after perforation. These results were confirmed by time courses of SFD measurements in the field. Field SFD values decreased immediately after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> installation and reached stable values after ~2 weeks with similar underestimations to the ones observed in the laboratory. We therefore propose a feasible approach to correct directly field observations of SFD for potential underestimations due to the wound effect.</p>

cAMPr: A single-wavelength fluorescent sensor for cyclic AMP
<p>Genetically encoded fluorescent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s enable cell-specific measurements of ions and small molecules in real time. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is one of the most important signaling molecules in virtually all cell types and organisms. We describe cAMPr, a new single-wavelength cAMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>. We developed cAMPr in bacteria and embryonic stem cells and validated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong> in mammalian neurons in vitro and in <i>Drosophila</i> circadian pacemaker neurons in intact brains. Comparison with other single-wavelength cAMP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>s showed that cAMPr improved the quantitative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion of cAMP abundance. In addition, cAMPr is compatible with both single-photon and two-photon imaging.

Ranking Businesses and Municipal Locations by Spatiotemporal Cardiac Arrest Risk to Guide Public Defibrillator Placement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to guide automated external defibrillator placement for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treatment have focused on identifying broadly defined location categories without considering hours of operation. Broad location categories may be composed of many businesses with varying accessibility. Identifying specific locations for automated external defibrillator deployment incorporating operating hours and time of OHCA occurrence may improve automated external defibrillator accessibility. We aim to identify specific businesses and municipal locations that maximize OHCA coverage on the basis of spatiotemporal assessment of OHCA risk in the immediate vicinity of franchise locations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a retrospective population-based cohort study using data from the Toronto Regional RescuNET Epistry cardiac arrest database.

We obtained their geographic coordinates and hours of operation from Web sites, by phone, or in person. We determined the number of OHCAs that occurred within 100 m of each location when it was open (spatiotemporal coverage) for Toronto overall and downtown. The businesses and municipal locations were then ranked by spatiotemporal OHCA coverage. To evaluate temporal stability of the rankings, we calculated intraclass correlation of the annual coverage values.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 2654 nontraumatic public OHCAs. Tim Hortons ranked first in Toronto, covering 286 OHCAs. Starbucks ranked first in downtown, covering 110 OHCAs.

The rankings exhibited high temporal stability with intraclass correlation values of 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.93) in Toronto and 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.71–0.86) in downtown.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed and ranked businesses and municipal locations by spatiotemporal OHCA risk in their immediate vicinity.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Multiplex Fluorescent, Activity-Based Protein Profiling Identifies Active α-Glycosidases and Other Hydrolases in Plants
<p>With nearly 140 α-glycosidases in 14 different families, plants are well equipped with enzymes that can break the α-glucosidic bonds in a large diversity of molecules. Here, we introduce activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) of α-glycosidases in plants using α-configured cyclophellitol aziridine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">probe</span></strong>s carrying various fluorophores or biotin. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">probe</span></strong>s label members of the GH31 family of glycosyl hydrolases, including endoplasmic reticulum-resident α-glucosidase-II Radial Swelling3/Priority for Sweet Life5 (RSW3/PSL5) and Golgi-resident α-mannosidase-II Hybrid Glycosylation1 (HGL1), both of which trim <i>N</i>-glycans on glycoproteins. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed the active state of extracellular α-glycosidases such as α-xylosidase XYL1, which acts on xyloglucans in the cell wall to promote cell expansion, and α-glucosidase AGLU1, which acts in starch hydrolysis and can suppress fungal invasion. Labeling of α-glycosidases generates pH-dependent signals that can be suppressed by α-glycosidase inhibitors in a broad range of plant species. To demonstrate its use on a nonmodel plant species, we applied ABPP on saffron crocus (<i>Crocus sativus</i>), a cash crop for the production of saffron spice. Using a combination of biotinylated glycosidase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">probe</span></strong>s, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed and quantified 67 active glycosidases in saffron crocus stigma, of which 10 are differentially active. We also uncovered massive changes in hydrolase activities in the corms upon infection with <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> using multiplex fluorescence labeling in combination with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">probe</span></strong>s for serine hydrolases and cysteine proteases. These experiments demonstrate the ease with which active α-glycosidases and other hydrolases can be analyzed through ABPP in model and nonmodel plants.</p>

Genetic and Functional Profiling of CD16-Dependent Natural Killer Activation Identifies Patients at Higher Risk of Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac transplantation is an effective therapy for end-stage heart failure. Because cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the major cause of late mortality after heart transplant (HT), there is a need to identify markers that reflect inflammatory or cytotoxic immune mechanisms contributing to its onset. Noninvasive and early stratification of patients at risk remains a challenge for adapting individualized therapy. The CD16 (Fc-gamma receptor 3A [FCGR3A]) receptor was recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a major determinant of antibody-mediated natural killer (NK) cell activation in HT biopsies; however, little is known about the role of CD16 in promoting allograft vasculopathy. This study aimed to investigate whether markers that reflect CD16-dependent circulating NK cell activation may identify patients at higher risk of developing CAV after HT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Blood samples were collected from 103 patients undergoing routine coronarography angiography for CAV diagnosis (median 5 years since HT). Genomic and phenotypic analyses of FCGR3A/CD16 Fc-receptor profiles were compared in CAV-positive (n=52) and CAV-free patients (n=51). The levels of CD16 expression and rituximab-dependent cell cytotoxic activity of peripheral NK cells in HT recipients were evaluated using a noninvasive NK-cellular humoral activation test.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Enhanced levels of CD16 expression and antibody-dependent NK cell cytotoxic function of HT recipients were associated with the FCGR3A-VV genotype. The frequency of the FCGR3A-VV genotype was significantly higher in the CAV<sup>+</sup> group (odds ratio, 3.9; <i>P</i>=0.0317) than in the CAV<sup>-</sup> group. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as an independent marker correlated with the presence of CAV at the time of coronary angiography by using multivariate logistic regression models. The FCGR3A-VV genotype was also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a baseline-independent predictor of CAV risk (odds ratio, 4.7; <i>P</i>=0.023).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This study unravels a prominent role for the CD16-dependent NK cell activation pathway in the complex array of factors that favor the progression of transplant arteriosclerosis. It highlights the clinical potential of a noninvasive evaluation of FCGR3A/CD16 in the early stratification of CAV risk. The recognition of CD16 as a major checkpoint that controls immune surveillance may promote the design of individualized NK cell–targeted therapies to limit vascular damage in highly responsive sensitized patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare Diseases study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of diagnosis were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited. Mutations in <i>BMPR2</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in 130 patients (14.8%). Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at diagnosis (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. However, radiological assessment alone could not accurately identify biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutation carriers. Patients with PAH with biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations had a shorter survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations are found in patients classified clinically as having idiopathic and heritable PAH. These patients cannot be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed reliably by computed tomography, but a low K<sc>co</sc> and a young age at diagnosis suggests the underlying molecular diagnosis. Genetic testing can identify these misclassified patients, allowing appropriate management and early referral for lung transplantation.</p></sec>

Truncation- and motif-based pan-cancer analysis reveals tumor-suppressing kinases
<p>A major challenge in cancer genomics is identifying “driver” mutations from the many neutral “passenger” mutations within a given tumor. To identify driver mutations that would otherwise be lost within mutational noise, we filtered genomic data by motifs that are critical for kinase activity. In the first step of our screen, we used data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and The Cancer Genome Atlas to identify kinases with truncation mutations occurring within or before the kinase domain. The top 30 tumor-suppressing kinases were aligned, and hotspots for loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed on the basis of amino acid conservation and mutational frequency. The functional consequences of new LOF mutations were biochemically validated, and the top 15 hotspot LOF residues were used in a pan-cancer analysis to define the tumor-suppressing kinome. A ranked list revealed MAP2K7, an essential mediator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, as a candidate tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, despite its mutational frequency falling within the mutational noise for this cancer type. The majority of mutations in MAP2K7 abolished its catalytic activity, and reactivation of the JNK pathway in gastric cancer cells harboring LOF mutations in MAP2K7 or the downstream kinase JNK suppressed clonogenicity and growth in soft agar, demonstrating the functional relevance of inactivating the JNK pathway in gastric cancer. Together, our data highlight a broadly applicable strategy to identify functional cancer driver mutations and define the JNK pathway as tumor-suppressive in gastric cancer.</p>

Quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution

Our concept makes use of quantum lock-in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion to continuously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">probe</span></strong> a signal of interest. Using the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, we demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion of oscillating magnetic fields with a frequency resolution of 70 microhertz over a megahertz bandwidth. The continuous sampling further guarantees an enhanced sensitivity, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio in excess of 10<sup>4</sup> for a 170-nanotesla test signal measured during a 1-hour interval.

Identification of Genes Related to Cold Tolerance and a Functional Allele That Confers Cold Tolerance
<p>Cold stress is a major factor limiting rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide, especially at the seedling and booting stages. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation of genes associated with cold tolerance (CT) in rice is important for sustainable food production. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide association study to identify the genetic loci associated with CT by using a 1,033-accession diversity panel. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed five CT-related genetic loci at the booting stage. Accessions carrying multiple cold-tolerant alleles displayed a higher seed-setting rate than did accessions that had no cold-tolerant alleles or carried a single allele. At the seedling stage, eight genetic loci related to CT have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed. Among these, <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as the candidate gene for the <i>qPSR10</i> genetic locus that is associated with CT in rice seedlings. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), SNP2<sup>G</sup>, at position 343 in <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> is responsible for conferring CT at the seedling stage in rice. Further analysis of the haplotype network revealed that SNP2<sup>G</sup> was present in 80.08% of the temperate <i>japonica</i> accessions but only 3.8% of the <i>indica</i> ones. We used marker-assisted selection to construct a series of BC<sub>4</sub>F<sub>3</sub> near-isogenic lines possessing the cold-tolerant allele SNP2<sup>G</sup>. When subjected to cold stress, plants carrying SNP2<sup>G</sup> survived better as seedlings and showed higher grain weight than plants carrying the SNP2<sup>A</sup> allele. The CT-related loci <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed here and the functional verification of <i>LOC_Os10g34840</i> will provide genetic resources for breeding cold-tolerant varieties and for studying the molecular basis of CT in rice.</p>

Bioorthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Tagging (BONCAT) Enables Time-Resolved Analysis of Protein Synthesis in Native Plant Tissue
<p>Proteomic plasticity undergirds stress responses in plants, and understanding such responses requires accurate measurement of the extent to which proteins levels are adjusted to counter external stimuli. Here, we adapt bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to interrogate protein synthesis in vegetative Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. BONCAT relies on the translational incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">probe</span></strong> into cellular proteins. In this study, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">probe</span></strong> is the Met surrogate azidohomoalanine (Aha), which carries a reactive azide moiety in its amino acid side chain. The azide handle in Aha can be selectively conjugated to dyes and functionalized beads to enable visualization and enrichment of newly synthesized proteins. We show that BONCAT is sensitive enough to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> Arabidopsis proteins synthesized within a 30-min interval defined by an Aha pulse and that the method can be used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> proteins made under conditions of light stress, osmotic shock, salt stress, heat stress, and recovery from heat stress. We further establish that BONCAT can be coupled to tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins synthesized during heat stress and recovery from heat stress. Our results are consistent with a model in which, upon the onset of heat stress, translation is rapidly reprogrammed to enhance the synthesis of stress mitigators and is again altered during recovery. All experiments were carried out with commercially available reagents, highlighting the accessibility of the BONCAT method to researchers interested in stress responses as well as translational and posttranslational regulation in plants.</p>

Risk factors for post-operative periprosthetic fractures following primary total hip arthroplasty with a proximally coated double-tapered cementless femoral component
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to identify patient- and surgery-related   risk factors for sustaining an early periprosthetic fracture following   primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) performed using a double-tapered   cementless femoral component (Bi-Metric femoral stem; Biomet Inc.,   Warsaw, Indiana).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 1598 consecutive hips, in 1441 patients receiving   primary THA between January 2010 and June 2015, were retrospectively   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed.

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>We recently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 156 proteins in human plasma that were each associated with the net Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score using an aptamer-based proteomic platform in Framingham Heart Study Offspring participants. Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 proteins might identify genetic determinants of risk-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of genetic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score–associated proteins using linear mixed-effects models in 2 population-based cohorts. We performed discovery analyses on plasma samples from 759 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, an observational study of the offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses, and validated these findings in plasma samples from 1421 participants of the MDCS (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study). To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular disease pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipoprotein E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 120 locus-protein associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously.

We described overlap among many of these loci and cardiovascular disease genetic risk variants. Finally, we experimentally validated a novel association between circulating apolipoprotein E levels and the transcription factor phosphatase 1G. Knockdown of phosphatase 1G in a human liver cell model resulted in decreased apolipoprotein E transcription and apolipoprotein E protein levels in cultured supernatants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed dozens of novel genetic determinants of proteins associated with the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score and experimentally validated a new role for phosphatase 1G in lipoprotein biology.

Thresholds for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Among African Americans in the Jackson Heart Study
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing is the reference standard for out-of-clinic BP measurement. Thresholds for identifying ambulatory hypertension (daytime systolic BP [SBP]/diastolic BP [DBP] ≥135/85 mm Hg, 24-hour SBP/DBP ≥130/80 mm Hg, and nighttime SBP/DBP ≥120/70 mm Hg) have been derived from European, Asian, and South American populations. We determined BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension in a US population-based sample of African American adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed data from the Jackson Heart Study, a population-based cohort study comprised exclusively of African American adults (n=5306). Analyses were restricted to 1016 participants who completed ambulatory BP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing at baseline in 2000 to 2004. Mean SBP and DBP levels were calculated for daytime (10:00 am–8:00 pm), 24-hour (all available readings), and nighttime (midnight–6:00 am) periods, separately. Daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime BP thresholds for ambulatory hypertension were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed using regression- and outcome-derived approaches. The composite of a cardiovascular disease or an all-cause mortality event was used in the outcome-derived approach. For this latter approach, BP thresholds were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed only for SBP because clinic DBP was not associated with the outcome. Analyses were stratified by antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among participants not taking antihypertensive medication, the regression-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP/DBP corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP of 140/90 mm Hg were 134/85 mm Hg, 130/81 mm Hg, and 123/73 mm Hg, respectively. The outcome-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP corresponding to a clinic SBP ≥140 mm Hg were 138 mm Hg, 134 mm Hg, and 129 mm Hg, respectively. Among participants taking antihypertensive medication, the regression-derived thresholds for daytime, 24-hour, and nighttime SBP/DBP corresponding to clinic SBP/DBP of 140/90 mm Hg were 135/85 mm Hg, 133/82 mm Hg, and 128/76 mm Hg, respectively.

Impact of Practice-Based Management of Pulmonary Artery Pressures in 2000 Patients Implanted With the CardioMEMS Sensor
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures in patients with heart failure are associated with a high risk for hospitalization and mortality. Recent clinical trial evidence demonstrated a direct relationship between lowering remotely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ed PA pressures and heart failure hospitalization risk reduction with a novel implantable PA pressure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing system (CardioMEMS HF System, St. Jude Medical). This study examines PA pressure changes in the first 2000 US patients implanted in general practice use.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>De<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed data from the remote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing Merlin.net (St. Jude Medical) database were used to examine PA pressure trends from the first consecutive 2000 patients with at least 6 months of follow-up. Changes in PA pressures were evaluated with an area under the curve methodology to estimate the total sum increase or decrease in pressures (mm Hg-day) during the follow-up period relative to the baseline pressure. As a reference, the PA pressure trends were compared with the historic CHAMPION clinical trial (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">monitor</span></strong>ing of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in New York Heart Association [NYHA] Functional Class III Heart Failure Patients). The area under the curve results are presented as mean±2 SE, and <i>P</i> values comparing the area under the curve of the general-use cohort with outcomes in the CHAMPION trial were computed by the <i>t</i> test with equal variance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients were on average 70±12 years old; 60% were male; 34% had preserved ejection fraction; and patients were followed up for an average of 333±125 days. At implantation, the mean PA pressure for the general-use patients was 34.9±10.2 mm Hg compared with 31.3±10.9 mm Hg for CHAMPION treatment and 32.0±10.5 mm Hg for CHAMPION control groups. The general-use patients had an area under the curve of −32.8 mm Hg-day at the 1-month time mark, −156.2 mm Hg-day at the 3-month time mark, and −434.0 mm Hg-day after 6 months of hemodynamic guided care, which was significantly lower than the treatment group in the CHAMPION trial. Patients consistently transmitted pressure information with a median of 1.27 days between transmissions after 6 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The first 2000 general-use patients managed with hemodynamic-guided heart failure care had higher PA pressures at baseline and experienced greater reduction in PA pressure over time compared with the pivotal CHAMPION clinical trial. These data demonstrate that general use of implantable hemodynamic technology in a nontrial setting leads to significant lowering of PA pressures.</p></sec>

MicroRNA-Based Therapy of GATA2-Deficient Vascular Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The transcription factor GATA2 orchestrates the expression of many endothelial-specific genes, illustrating its crucial importance for endothelial cell function. The capacity of this transcription factor in orchestrating endothelial-important microRNAs (miRNAs/miR) is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Endothelial GATA2 was functionally analyzed in human endothelial cells in vitro. Endogenous short interfering RNA–mediated knockdown and lentiviral-based overexpression were applied to decipher the capacity of GATA2 in regulating cell viability and capillary formation. Next, the GATA2-dependent miR transcriptome was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by using a profiling approach on the basis of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Transcriptional control of miR promoters was assessed via chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase promoter assays, and bisulfite sequencing analysis of sites in proximity.

Downstream miR targets were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed via bioinformatic target prediction and luciferase reporter gene assays. In vitro findings were translated to a mouse model of carotid injury in an endothelial <i>GATA2</i> knockout background.

Specifically, proangiogenic miR-126 was regulated by GATA2 transcriptionally and targeted antiangiogenic SPRED1 and FOXO3a contributing to GATA2-mediated formation of normal vascular structures, whereas GATA2 deficiency led to vascular abnormalities. In contrast to GATA2 deficiency, supplementation with miR-126 normalized vascular function and expression profiles of cytokines contributing to proangiogenic paracrine effects. GATA2 silencing resulted in endothelial DNA hypomethylation leading to induced expression of antiangiogenic miR-221 by GATA2-dependent demethylation of a putative CpG island in the miR-221 promoter. Mechanistically, a reverted GATA2 phenotype by endogenous suppression of miR-221 was mediated through direct proangiogenic miR-221 target genes ICAM1 and ETS1. In a mouse model of carotid injury, GATA2 was reduced, and systemic supplementation of miR-126–coupled nanoparticles enhanced miR-126 availability in the carotid artery and improved reendothelialization of injured carotid arteries in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>GATA2-mediated regulation of miR-126 and miR-221 has an important impact on endothelial biology.

Mechanism of transmembrane signaling by sensor histidine kinases

Our findings provide the structural framework for complete understanding of TM TCS signaling and for development of antimicrobial treatments targeting TCSs.</p>

Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis Provides Insight into the Domestication and Improvement of Pear (<i>P. pyrifolia</i>) Fruit
<p>Knowledge of the genetic changes that occurred during the domestication and improvement of perennial trees at the RNA level is limited. Here, we used RNA sequencing analysis to compare representative sets of wild, landrace, and improved accessions of pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i>) to gain insight into the genetic changes associated with domestication and improvement. A close population relationship and similar nucleotide diversity was observed between the wild and landrace groups, whereas the improved group had substantially reduced nucleotide diversity.

The expression diversity of selected genes exhibited a 20.89% reduction from the wild group to the landrace group, but a 23.13% recovery was observed from the landrace to the improved group, showing a distinctly different pattern with variation of sequence diversity. Module-trait association analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 16 distinct coexpression modules, six of which were highly associated with important fruit traits.

HCN Regulates Cellular Processes through Posttranslational Modification of Proteins by <i>S-</i>cyanylation
<p>Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is coproduced with ethylene in plant cells and is primarily enzymatically detoxified by the mitochondrial β-CYANOALANINE SYNTHASE (CAS-C1). Permanent or transient depletion of CAS-C1 activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) results in physiological alterations in the plant that suggest that HCN acts as a gasotransmitter molecule. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis of mitochondrially enriched samples isolated from the wild type and <i>cas-c1</i> mutant revealed significant changes in protein content, identifying 451 proteins that are absent or less abundant in <i>cas-c1</i> and 353 proteins that are only present or more abundant in <i>cas-c1</i>. Gene ontology classification of these proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed proteomic changes that explain the root hairless phenotype and the altered immune response observed in the <i>cas-c1</i> mutant. The mechanism of action of cyanide as a signaling molecule was addressed using two proteomic approaches aimed at identifying the <i>S-</i>cyanylation of Cys as a posttranslational modification of proteins.

In vitro analysis of these enzymes showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation of SBPase Cys<sup>74</sup>, CYP20-3 Cys<sup>259</sup>, and ENO2 Cys<sup>346</sup> residues affected their enzymatic activity. Gene Ontology classification and protein-protein interaction cluster analysis showed that <i>S-</i>cyanylation is involved in the regulation of primary metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, and the Calvin and <i>S</i>-adenosyl-Met cycles.</p>

MAPINS, a Highly Efficient Detection Method That Identifies Insertional Mutations and Complex DNA Rearrangements
<p>Insertional mutagenesis, in which a piece of exogenous DNA is integrated randomly into the genomic DNA of the recipient cell, is a useful method to generate new mutants with phenotypes of interest. The unicellular green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> is an outstanding model for studying many biological processes. We developed a new computational algorithm, MAPINS (mapping insertions), to efficiently identify insertion sites created by the integration of an <i>APHVIII</i> (<i>aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase VIII</i>) cassette that confers paromomycin resistance. Using whole-genome sequencing data, this method eliminates the need for genomic DNA manipulation and retains all the sequencing information provided by paired-end sequencing. We experimentally verified 38 insertion sites out of 41 sites (93%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by MAPINS from 20 paromomycin-resistant strains. Using meiotic analysis of 18 of these strains, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed insertion sites that completely cosegregate with paromomycin resistance. In six of the seven strains with a mutant phenotype, we demonstrated complete cosegregation of the mutant phenotype and the verified insertion site. In addition, we provide direct evidence of complex rearrangements of genomic DNA in five strains, three of which involve the <i>APHVIII</i> insertion site. We suggest that strains obtained by insertional mutagenesis are more complicated than expected from previous analyses in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>.

Comparison of Micropore Distribution in Cell Walls of Softwood and Hardwood Xylem
<p>The porosity of wood cell walls is of interest for both understanding xylem functionality and from a wood materials perspective. The movement of water in xylem generally occurs through the macroporous networks formed in softwood by bordered pits and in hardwood by the intervessel pits and open conduits created by vessels and perforation plates. In some situations, such as cavitated xylem, water can only move through the micropores that occur in lignified tracheid and fiber cell walls; however, these micropore networks are poorly understood. Here, we used molecular microscopy analysis of radiata pine (<i>Pinus radiata</i>) and red beech (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>) to determine the distribution of micropores in the secondary walls and middle lamellae of tracheids and fibers in relation to cell wall composition. Using two different types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">probe</span></strong>, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed a greater porosity of secondary cell walls and a reduced porosity of the middle lamella. Areas of reduced porosity were observed in the outer regions of the secondary cell wall of both tracheids and fibers that appear unrelated to lignification or the distribution of cellulose, mannan, and xylan. Hardwood fiber cell walls were less lignified than those of softwood tracheids and showed greater accessibility to porosity <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">probe</span></strong>s. Vessel cell walls were comparable to those of fibers in terms of both porosity and lignification. Lignification is probably the primary determinant of cell wall porosity in xylem. The highly lignified middle lamella, and lumen surface, act as a barrier to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">probe</span></strong> movement and, therefore, water movement in both softwood and hardwood.</p>

The Major Origin of Seedless Grapes Is Associated with a Missense Mutation in the MADS-Box Gene <i>VviAGL11</i>
<p>Seedlessness is greatly prized by consumers of fresh grapes. While stenospermocarpic seed abortion determined by the <i>SEED DEVELOPMENT INHIBITOR</i> (<i>SDI</i>) locus is the usual source of seedlessness in commercial grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) cultivars, the underlying <i>sdi</i> mutation remains unknown. Here, we undertook an integrative approach to identify the causal mutation. Quantitative genetics and fine-mapping in two ‘Crimson Seedless’-derived F1 mapping populations confirmed the major effect of the <i>SDI</i> locus and delimited the <i>sdi</i> mutation to a 323-kb region on chromosome 18. RNA-sequencing comparing seed traces of seedless and seeds of seeded F1 individuals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed processes triggered during <i>sdi</i>-determined seed abortion, including the activation of salicylic acid-dependent autoimmunity. The RNA-sequencing data set was investigated for candidate genes, and while no evidence for causal cis-acting regulatory mutations was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed, deleterious nucleotide changes in coding sequences of the seedless haplotype were predicted in two genes within the <i>sdi</i> fine-mapping interval. Targeted resequencing of the two genes in a collection of 124 grapevine cultivars showed that only the point variation causing the arginine-197-to-leucine substitution in the seed morphogenesis regulator gene <i>AGAMOUS-LIKE11</i> (<i>VviAGL11</i>) was fully linked with stenospermocarpy. The concurrent postzygotic variation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed for this missense polymorphism and seedlessness phenotype in seeded somatic variants of the original stenospermocarpic cultivar supports a causal effect. We postulate that seed abortion caused by this amino acid substitution in VviAGL11 is the major cause of seedlessness in cultivated grapevine. This information can be exploited to boost seedless grape breeding.</p>

The G Protein <i>β</i>-Subunit, AGB1, Interacts with FERONIA in RALF1-Regulated Stomatal Movement
<p>Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins are composed of Gα, G<i>β</i>, and Gγ subunits and function as molecular switches in signal transduction. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are one canonical Gα (GPA1), three extra-large Gα (XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3), one G<i>β</i> (AGB1), and three Gγ (AGG1, AGG2, and AGG3) subunits. To elucidate AGB1 molecular signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation using plasma membrane-enriched proteins followed by mass spectrometry to identify the protein interactors of AGB1. After eliminating proteins present in the control immunoprecipitation, commonly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed contaminants, and organellar proteins, a total of 103 candidate AGB1-associated proteins were confidently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed all of the G protein subunits except XLG1, receptor-like kinases, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling-related proteins, and 14-3-3-like proteins, all of which may couple with or modulate G protein signaling. We confirmed physical interaction between AGB1 and the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) family of polypeptides have been shown to be ligands of FER. In this study, we demonstrate that RALF1 regulates stomatal apertures and does so in a G protein-dependent manner, inhibiting stomatal opening and promoting stomatal closure in Columbia but not in <i>agb1</i> mutants. We further show that AGGs and XLGs, but not GPA1, participate in RALF1-mediated stomatal signaling. Our results suggest that FER acts as a G protein-coupled receptor for plant heterotrimeric G proteins.</p>

Branched Pectic Galactan in Phloem-Sieve-Element Cell Walls: Implications for Cell Mechanics
<p>A major question in plant biology concerns the specification and functional differentiation of cell types. This is in the context of constraints imposed by networks of cell walls that both adhere cells and contribute to the form and function of developing organs. Here, we report the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation of a glycan epitope that is specific to phloem sieve element cell walls in several systems. A monoclonal antibody, designated LM26, binds to the cell wall of phloem sieve elements in stems of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), <i>Miscanthus</i> x <i>giganteus</i>, and notably sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i>) roots where phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation is an important factor for the study of phloem unloading of Suc. Using microarrays of synthetic oligosaccharides, the LM26 epitope has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as a β-1,6-galactosyl substitution of β-1,4-galactan requiring more than three backbone residues for optimized recognition. This branched galactan structure has previously been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) bulbs in which the LM26 epitope is widespread throughout most cell walls including those of phloem cells. Garlic bulb cell wall material has been used to confirm the association of the LM26 epitope with cell wall pectic rhamnogalacturonan-I polysaccharides. In the phloem tissues of grass stems, the LM26 epitope has a complementary pattern to that of the LM5 linear β-1,4-galactan epitope, which is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed only in companion cell walls. Mechanical probing of transverse sections of <i>M</i>. x <i>giganteus</i> stems and leaves by atomic force microscopy indicates that phloem sieve element cell walls have a lower indentation modulus (indicative of higher elasticity) than companion cell walls.</p>

The Conserved and Unique Genetic Architecture of Kernel Size and Weight in Maize and Rice
<p>Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a major staple crop. Maize kernel size and weight are important contributors to its yield. Here, we measured kernel length, kernel width, kernel thickness, hundred kernel weight, and kernel test weight in 10 recombinant inbred line populations and dissected their genetic architecture using three statistical models. In total, 729 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed, many of which were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in all three models, including 22 major QTLs that each can explain more than 10% of phenotypic variation. To provide candidate genes for these QTLs, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 30 maize genes that are orthologs of 18 rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes reported to affect rice seed size or weight. Interestingly, 24 of these 30 genes are located in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed QTLs or within 1 Mb of the significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We further confirmed the effects of five genes on maize kernel size/weight in an independent association mapping panel with 540 lines by candidate gene association analysis. Lastly, the function of <i>ZmINCW1</i>, a homolog of rice <i>GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING1</i> that affects seed size and weight, was characterized in detail. <i>ZmINCW1</i> is close to QTL peaks for kernel size/weight (less than 1 Mb) and contains significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms affecting kernel size/weight in the association panel. Overexpression of this gene can rescue the reduced weight of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homozygous mutant line in the <i>AtcwINV2</i> gene (Arabidopsis ortholog of <i>ZmINCW1</i>). These results indicate that the molecular mechanisms affecting seed development are conserved in maize, rice, and possibly Arabidopsis.</p>

Cytokinin Biosynthesis Promotes Cortical Cell Responses during Nodule Development
<p>Legume mutants have shown the requirement for receptor-mediated cytokinin signaling in symbiotic nodule organogenesis. While the receptors are central regulators, cytokinin also is accumulated during early phases of symbiotic interaction, but the pathways involved have not yet been fully resolved. To identify the source, timing, and effect of this accumulation, we followed transcript levels of the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway genes in a sliding developmental zone of <i>Lotus japonicus</i> roots. <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as the major contributors to the first cytokinin burst. The genetic dependence and Nod factor responsiveness of these genes confirm that cytokinin biosynthesis is a key target of the common symbiosis pathway. The accumulation of <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> transcripts occurs independent of the <i>LjLhk1</i> receptor during nodulation. Together with the rapid repression of both genes by cytokinin, this indicates that <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> contribute to, rather than respond to, the initial cytokinin buildup. Analysis of the cytokinin response using the synthetic cytokinin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensor</span></strong>, <i>TCSn</i>, showed that this response occurs in cortical cells before spreading to the epidermis in <i>L. japonicus</i>. While mutant analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed redundancy in several biosynthesis families, we found that mutation of <i>LjIpt4</i> limits nodule numbers. Overexpression of <i>LjIpt3</i> or <i>LjLog4</i> alone was insufficient to produce the robust formation of spontaneous nodules. In contrast, overexpressing a complete cytokinin biosynthesis pathway leads to large, often fused spontaneous nodules. These results show the importance of cytokinin biosynthesis in initiating and balancing the requirement for cortical cell activation without uncontrolled cell proliferation.</p>

Leaf Photosynthetic Parameters Related to Biomass Accumulation in a Global Rice Diversity Survey
<p>Mining natural variations is a major approach to identify new options to improve crop light use efficiency. So far, successes in identifying photosynthetic parameters positively related to crop biomass accumulation through this approach are scarce, possibly due to the earlier emphasis on properties related to leaf instead of canopy photosynthetic efficiency. This study aims to uncover rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) natural variations to identify leaf physiological parameters that are highly correlated with biomass accumulation, a surrogate of canopy photosynthesis. To do this, we systematically investigated 14 photosynthetic parameters and four morphological traits in a rice population, which consists of 204 U.S. Department of Agriculture-curated minicore accessions collected globally and 11 elite Chinese rice cultivars in both Beijing and Shanghai. To identify key components responsible for the variance of biomass accumulation, we applied a stepwise feature-selection approach based on linear regression models. Although there are large variations in photosynthetic parameters measured in different environments, we observed that photosynthetic rate under low light (A<sub>low</sub>) was highly related to biomass accumulation and also exhibited high genomic inheritability in both environments, suggesting its great potential to be used as a target for future rice breeding programs. Large variations in A<sub>low</sub> among modern rice cultivars further suggest the great potential of using this parameter in contemporary rice breeding for the improvement of biomass and, hence, yield potential.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic control of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under control and water-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with control conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed for these traits under control conditions, 106 were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed under water-deficit stress, and 76 were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed for trait plasticity.

Genome-Wide Prediction of Metabolic Enzymes, Pathways, and Gene Clusters in Plants
<p>Plant metabolism underpins many traits of ecological and agronomic importance. Plants produce numerous compounds to cope with their environments but the biosynthetic pathways for most of these compounds have not yet been elucidated. To engineer and improve metabolic traits, we need comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the organization and regulation of plant metabolism at the genome scale. Here, we present a computational pipeline to identify metabolic enzymes, pathways, and gene clusters from a sequenced genome. Using this pipeline, we generated metabolic pathway databases for 22 species and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed metabolic gene clusters from 18 species. This unified resource can be used to conduct a wide array of comparative studies of plant metabolism. Using the resource, we discovered a widespread occurrence of metabolic gene clusters in plants: 11,969 clusters from 18 species. The prevalence of metabolic gene clusters offers an intriguing possibility of an untapped source for uncovering new metabolite biosynthesis pathways. For example, more than 1,700 clusters contain enzymes that could generate a specialized metabolite scaffold (signature enzymes) and enzymes that modify the scaffold (tailoring enzymes). In four species with sufficient gene expression data, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 43 highly coexpressed clusters that contain signature and tailoring enzymes, of which eight were characterized previously to be functional pathways. Finally, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed patterns of genome organization that implicate local gene duplication and, to a lesser extent, single gene transposition as having played roles in the evolution of plant metabolic gene clusters.</p>

Identification and Characterization of Arabidopsis Seed Coat Mucilage Proteins
<p>Plant cell wall proteins are important regulators of cell wall architecture and function. However, because cell wall proteins are difficult to extract and analyze, they are generally poorly understood. Here, we describe the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>cation and characterization of proteins integral to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seed coat mucilage, a specialized layer of the extracellular matrix composed of plant cell wall carbohydrates that is used as a model for cell wall research. The proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in mucilage include those previously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by genetic analysis, and several mucilage proteins are reduced in mucilage-deficient mutant seeds, suggesting that these proteins are genuinely associated with the mucilage. Arabidopsis mucilage has both nonadherent and adherent layers. Both layers have similar protein profiles except for proteins involved in lipid metabolism, which are present exclusively in the adherent mucilage. The most abundant mucilage proteins include a family of proteins named TESTA ABUNDANT1 (TBA1) to TBA3; a less abundant fourth homolog was named TBA-LIKE (TBAL). <i>TBA</i> and <i>TBAL</i> transcripts and promoter activities were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed in developing seed coats, and their expression requires seed coat differentiation regulators. TBA proteins are secreted to the mucilage pocket during differentiation. Although reverse genetics failed to identify a function for TBAs/TBAL, the <i>TBA</i> promoters are highly expressed and cell type specific and so should be very useful tools for targeting proteins to the seed coat epidermis. Altogether, these results highlight the mucilage proteome as a model for cell walls in general, as it shares similarities with other cell wall proteomes while also containing mucilage-specific features.</p>

Genetic Architecture of Flowering-Time Variation in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The transition to reproductive development is a crucial step in the plant life cycle, and the timing of this transition is an important factor in crop yields. Here, we report new insights into the genetic control of natural variation in flowering time in <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, a nondomesticated pooid grass closely related to cereals such as wheat (<i>Triticum</i> spp.) and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.). A recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between the rapid-flowering accession Bd21 and the delayed-flowering accession Bd1-1 were grown in a variety of environmental conditions to enable exploration of the genetic architecture of flowering time. A genotyping-by-sequencing approach was used to develop SNP markers for genetic map construction, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control differences in flowering time were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed. Many of the flowering-time QTLs are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed across a range of photoperiod and vernalization conditions, suggesting that the genetic control of flowering within this population is robust. The two major QTLs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed in undomesticated <i>B. distachyon</i> colocalize with <i>VERNALIZATION1/PHYTOCHROME C</i> and <i>VERNALIZATION2</i>, loci <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed as flowering regulators in the domesticated crops wheat and barley. This suggests that variation in flowering time is controlled in part by a set of genes broadly conserved within pooid grasses.</p>

Genetic Bases of Fungal White Rot Wood Decay Predicted by Phylogenomic Analysis of Correlated Gene-Phenotype Evolution
<p>Fungal decomposition of plant cell walls (PCW) is a complex process that has diverse industrial applications and huge impacts on the carbon cycle. White rot (WR) is a powerful mode of PCW decay in which lignin and carbohydrates are both degraded. Mechanistic studies of decay coupled with comparative genomic analyses have provided clues to the enzymatic components of WR systems and their evolutionary origins, but the complete suite of genes necessary for WR remains undetermined. Here, we use phylogenomic comparative methods, which we validate through simulations, to identify shifts in gene family diversification rates that are correlated with evolution of WR, using data from 62 fungal genomes. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed 409 gene families that appear to be evolutionarily correlated with WR. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed gene families encode well-characterized decay enzymes, e.g., fungal class II peroxidases and cellobiohydrolases, and enzymes involved in import and detoxification pathways, as well as 73 gene families that have no functional annotation. About 310 of the 409 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed gene families are present in the genome of the model WR fungus <i>Phanerochaete chrysosporium</i> and 192 of these (62%) have been shown to be upregulated under ligninolytic culture conditions, which corroborates the phylogeny-based functional inferences. These results illuminate the complexity of WR and suggest that its evolution has involved a general elaboration of the decay apparatus, including numerous gene families with as-yet unknown exact functions.</p>

The Lake Dali Nur population inhabits one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth, with an alkalinity up to 50 mmol/L (pH 9.6), thus providing an exceptional model with which to characterize the mechanisms of genomic evolution underlying adaptation to extreme environments. Here, we developed the reference genome assembly for <i>L. waleckii</i> from Lake Dali Nur. Intriguingly, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> genome.

Whole-Genome Sequencing of Tibetan Macaque (<i>Macaca thibetana</i>) Provides New Insight into the Macaque Evolutionary History
<p>Macaques are the most widely distributed nonhuman primates and used as animal models in biomedical research. The availability of full-genome sequences from them would be essential to both biomedical and primate evolutionary studies. Previous studies have reported whole-genome sequences from rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) and cynomolgus macaque (<i>M. fascicularis</i>, CE), both of which belong to the <i>fascicularis</i> group. Here, we present a 37-fold coverage genome sequence of the Tibetan macaque (<i>M. thibetana</i>; TM). TM is an endemic species to China belonging to the <i>sinica</i> group<i>.</i> On the basis of mapping to the rhesus macaque genome, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed approximately 11.9 million single-nucleotide variants), of which 3.9 million were TM specific, as assessed by comparison two Chinese rhesus macaques (CR) and two CE genomes. Some genes carried TM-specific homozygous nonsynonymous variants (TSHNVs), which were scored as deleterious in human by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant) and were enriched in the eye disease genes. In total, 273 immune response and disease-related genes carried at least one TSHNV. The heterozygosity rates of two CRs (0.002617 and 0.002612) and two CEs (0.003004 and 0.003179) were approximately three times higher than that of TM (0.000898). Polymerase chain reaction resequencing of 18 TM individuals showed that 29 TSHNVs exhibited high allele frequencies, thus confirming their low heterozygosity. Genome-wide genetic divergence analysis demonstrated that TM was more closely related to CR than to CE. We further <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed unusual low divergence regions between TM and CR. In addition, after applying statistical criteria to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> putative introgression regions (PIRs) in the TM genome, up to 239,620 kb PIRs (8.84% of the genome) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed. Given that TM and CR have overlapping geographical distributions, had the same refuge during the Middle Pleistocene, and show similar mating behaviors, it is highly likely that there was an ancient introgression event between them. Moreover, demographic inferences revealed that TM exhibited a similar demographic history as other macaques until 0.5 Ma, but then it maintained a lower effective population size until present time. Our study has provided new insight into the macaque evolutionary history, confirming hybridization events between macaque species groups based on genome-wide data.</p>

The Developmental Brain Gene <i>NPAS3</i> Contains the Largest Number of Accelerated Regulatory Sequences in the Human Genome
<p>To identify the evolutionary genetic novelties that contributed to shape human-specific traits such as the use of a complex language, long-term planning and exceptional learning abilities is one of the ultimate frontiers of modern biology. Evolutionary signatures of functional shifts could be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed by comparing noncoding regions that are highly conserved across mammals or primates and rapidly accumulated nucleotide substitutions only in the lineage leading to humans. As gene loci densely populated with human-accelerated elements (HAEs) are more likely to have contributed to human-specific novelties, we sought to identify the transcriptional units and genomic 1 Mb intervals of the entire human genome carrying the highest number of HAEs. To this end, we took advantage of four available data sets of human genomic accelerated regions obtained through different comparisons and algorithms and performed a meta-analysis of the combined data. We found that the brain developmental transcription factor <i>neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 3</i> (<i>NPAS3</i>) contains the largest cluster of noncoding-accelerated regions in the human genome with up to 14 elements that are highly conserved in mammals, including primates, but carry human-specific nucleotide substitutions. We then tested the ability of the 14 HAEs <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed at the <i>NPAS3</i> locus to act as transcriptional regulatory sequences in a reporter expression assay performed in transgenic zebrafish. We found that 11 out of the 14 HAEs present in <i>NPAS3</i> act as transcriptional enhancers during development, particularly within the nervous system. As <i>NPAS3</i> is known to play a crucial role during mammalian brain development, our results indicate that the high density of HAEs present in the human <i>NPAS3</i> locus could have modified the spatiotemporal expression pattern of <i>NPAS3</i> in the developing human brain and, therefore, contributed to human brain evolution.</p>

Development of the GABA-ergic signaling system and its role in larval swimming in sea urchin
<p>The present study aimed to elucidate the development and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA)-ergic regulation of larval swimming in the sea urchin <i>Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus</i> by cloning glutamate decarboxylase (<i>Hp-gad</i>), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (<i>Hp-gabrA</i>) and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein (<i>Hp-gabarap</i>), and by performing immunohistochemistry. The regulation of larval swimming was increasingly dependent on the GABAergic system, which was active from the 2 days post-fertilization (d.p.f.) pluteus stage onwards. GABA-immunoreactive cells were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed as a subpopulation of secondary mesenchyme cells during gastrulation and eventually constituted the ciliary band and a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells during the pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gad</i> transcription was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed by RT-PCR during the period when Hp-Gad-positive cells were seen as a subpopulation of blastocoelar cells and on the apical side of the ciliary band from the 2 d.p.f. pluteus stage. Consistent with these observations, inhibition of GAD with 3-mercaptopropioninc acid inhibited GABA immunoreactivity and larval swimming dose dependently. <i>Hp-gabrA</i> amplimers were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed weakly in unfertilized eggs and 4 d.p.f. plutei but strongly from fertilized eggs to 2 d.p.f. plutei, and Hp-GabrA, together with GABA, was localized at the ciliary band in association with dopamine receptor D1 from the two-arm pluteus stage. <i>Hp-gabarap</i> transcription and protein expression were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed from the swimming blastula stage. Inhibition of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor by bicuculline inhibited larval swimming dose dependently. Inhibition of larval swimming by either 3-mercaptopropionic acid or bicuculline was more severe in older larvae (17 and 34 d.p.f. plutei) than in younger ones (1 d.p.f. prism larvae).</p>

The diagnostic performance of radiographic criteria to detect aseptic acetabular component loosening after revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of radiographic   criteria to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> aseptic acetabular loosening after revision total   hip arthroplasty (THA). Secondary aims were to determine the predictive   values of different thresholds of migration and to determine the   predictive values of radiolucency criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Acetabular component migration to re-revision was measured retrospectively   using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup) and manual measurements   (Sutherland method) in two groups: Group A, 52 components (48 patients) found   not loose at re-revision and Group B, 42 components (36 patients)   found loose at re-revision between 1980 and 2015. The presence and   extent of radiolucent lines was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using EBRA, both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were   excellent diagnostic tests for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ing aseptic loosening. The   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was   0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The thresholds of 2.5 mm proximal translation   or 2° sagittal rotation (EBRA) in combination with radiolucency   criteria had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88% to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>   aseptic loosening. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive   value and negative predictive value (NPV) of radiolucency criteria   were 41%, 100%, 100% and 68% respectively. Manual measurements of   both proximal translation and sagittal rotation were very good diagnostic tests.   The area under the ROC curve was 0.86 and 0.92 respectively. However,   manual measurements had a decreased specificity compared with EBRA.   Radiolucency criteria had a poor sensitivity and NPV of 41% and   68% respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that EBRA and manual migration measurements   can be used as accurate diagnostic tools to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> aseptic loosening   of cementless acetabular components used at revision THA. Radiolucency   criteria should not be used in isolation to exclude loosening of   cementless acetabular components used at revision THA given their poor   sensitivity and NPV.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:458–64.</p></sec>

Predictors of mortality following conservatively managed fractures of the odontoid in elderly patients
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Rates of mortality as high as 25% to 30% have been described   following fractures of the odontoid in the elderly population. The   aim of this study was to examine whether easily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>able variables   present on admission are associated with mortality. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A consecutive series of 83 elderly patients with a fracture of   the odontoid following a low-impact injury was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed retrospectively.   Data that were collected included demographics, past medical history   and the results of blood tests on admission. Radiological investigations   were used to assess the Anderson and D’Alonzo classification and   displacement of the fracture. The mean age was 82.9 years (65 to   101). Most patients (66; 79.5%) had a type 2 fracture. An associated   neurological deficit was present in 11 (13.3%). All were treated   conservatively; 80 (96.4%) with a hard collar and three (3.6%) with   halo vest immobilisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The rate of mortality was 16% (13 patients) at 30 days and 24%   (20 patients) at one year after injury. A low serum level of haemoglobin   and the presence of a neurological deficit on admission were independent   predicators of mortality at 30 days on binary logistic regression   analysis. A, low level of haemoglobin, admission from an institution,   a neurological deficit and type 3 fractures were independent predictors   of mortality at one year. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We suggest that these easily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>able predictors present   on admission can be used to identify patients at high risk and guide   management by a multidisciplinary team.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:116–21.</p></sec>

Does a less intensive surveillance protocol affect the survival of patients after treatment of a sarcoma of the limb?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>A single-centre prospective randomized trial was conducted to   investigate whether a less intensive follow-up protocol would not   be inferior to a conventional follow-up protocol, in terms of overall   survival, in patients who have undergone surgery for sarcoma of   the limb. Initial short-term results were published in 2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The primary objective was to show non-inferiority of a chest   radiograph (CXR) group compared with a CT scan group, and of a less   frequent (six-monthly) group than a more frequent (three-monthly)   group, in two-by-two comparison. The primary outcome was overall   survival and the secondary outcome was a recurrence-free survival.   Five-year survival was compared between the CXR and CT scan groups   and between the three-monthly and six-monthly groups. Of 500 patients   who were enrolled, 476 were available for follow-up. Survival analyses   were performed on a per-protocol basis (n = 412).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The updated results recorded 12 (2.4%) local recurrences, 182   (36.8%) metastases, and 56 (11.3%) combined (local + metastases)   recurrence at a median follow-up of 81 months (60 to 118). Of 68   local recurrences, 60 (88%) were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed by the patients themselves.   The six-monthly regime (overall survival (OS) 54%, recurrence-free   survival (RFS) 46%) did not lead to a worse survival and was not   inferior to the three-monthly regime (OS 55%, RFS 47%) in terms   of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ing recurrence. Although CT scans (OS 53%, RFS 54%) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed   pulmonary metastasis earlier, it did not lead to a better survival   compared with CXR (OS 56%, RFS 59%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The overall survival of patients who are treated for a sarcoma   of the limb is not inferior to those followed up with a less intensive   regimen than a more intensive protocol, in terms of frequency of   visits and mode of imaging.

WT1 regulates the development of the posterior taste field
<p>Despite the importance of taste in determining nutrient intake, our understanding of the processes that control the development of the peripheral taste system is lacking. Several early regulators of taste development have been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed, including sonic hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 4 and multiple members of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, the regulation of these factors, including their induction, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a crucial role for the Wilms' tumor 1 protein (WT1) in circumvallate (CV) papillae development. WT1 is a transcription factor that is important in the normal development of multiple tissues, including both the olfactory and visual systems. In mice, WT1 expression is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>able by E12.5, when the CV taste placode begins to form. In mice lacking WT1, the CV fails to develop normally and markers of early taste development are dysregulated compared with wild type. We demonstrate that expression of the WT1 target genes <i>Lef1</i>, <i>Ptch1</i> and <i>Bmp4</i> is significantly reduced in developing tongue tissue derived from <i>Wt1</i> knockout mice and that, in normal tongue, WT1 is bound to the promoter regions of these genes. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of WT1 in cultured taste cells leads to a reduction in the expression of <i>Lef1</i> and <i>Ptch1</i>. Our data identify WT1 as a crucial transcription factor in the development of the CV through the regulation of multiple signaling pathways that have established roles in the formation and patterning of taste placodes.</p>

Proteomic Architecture of Human Coronary and Aortic Atherosclerosis
<sec><title>Backgound:</title><p>The inability to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong> premature atherosclerosis significantly hinders implementation of personalized therapy to prevent coronary heart disease. A comprehensive understanding of arterial protein networks and how they change in early atherosclerosis could identify new biomarkers for disease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ion and improved therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here we describe the human arterial proteome and proteomic features strongly associated with early atherosclerosis based on mass spectrometry analysis of coronary artery and aortic specimens from 100 autopsied young adults (200 arterial specimens). Convex analysis of mixtures, differential dependent network modeling, and bioinformatic analyses defined the composition, network rewiring, and likely regulatory features of the protein networks associated with early atherosclerosis and how they vary across 2 anatomic distributions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The data document significant differences in mitochondrial protein abundance between coronary and aortic samples (coronary>>aortic), and between atherosclerotic and normal tissues (atherosclerotic<<normal), and major alterations in tumor necrosis factor, insulin receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ protein networks, as well, in the setting of early disease. In addition, a subset of tissue protein biomarkers indicative of early atherosclerosis was shown to predict anatomically defined coronary atherosclerosis when measured in plasma samples in a separate clinical cohort (area under the curve=0.92 [0.83–0.96]), thereby validating the use of human tissue proteomics to discover relevant plasma biomarkers for clinical applications. In addition to the specific proteins and pathways <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed here, the publicly available data resource and the analysis pipeline used illustrate a strategy for interrogating and interpreting the proteomic architecture of tissues that may be relevant for other chronic diseases characterized by multicellular tissue phenotypes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The human arterial proteome can be viewed as a complex network whose architectural features vary considerably as a function of anatomic location and the presence or absence of atherosclerosis. The data suggest important reductions in mitochondrial protein abundance in early atherosclerosis and also identify a subset of plasma proteins that are highly predictive of angiographically defined coronary disease.</p></sec>

Primary Myocardial Fibrosis as an Alternative Phenotype Pathway of Inherited Cardiac Structural Disorders
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Myocardial fibrosis is a common postmortem finding among young individuals with sudden cardiac death. Because there is no known single cause, we tested the hypothesis that some cases of myocardial fibrosis in the absence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>able causes (primary myocardial fibrosis [PMF]) are associated with genetic variants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Tissue was obtained at autopsy from 4031 consecutive individuals with sudden cardiac death in Northern Finland, among whom PMF was the only structural finding in 145 subjects with sudden cardiac death. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing using a panel of 174 genes associated with myocardial structure and ion channel function when autopsies did not identify a secondary basis for myocardial fibrosis. All variants with an effect on protein and with a minor allele frequency <0.01 were classified as pathogenic or variants of uncertain significance on the basis of American College of Medical Genetics consensus guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among the 96 specimens with DNA passing quality control (66%), postmortem genetic tests <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">identifi</span></strong>ed 24 variants of known or uncertain significance in 26 subjects (27%). Ten were pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 10 subjects (10%), and 14 were variants of uncertain significance in 11 genes among 16 subjects (17%). Five variants were in genes associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, 6 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy–associated genes, and 11 in dilated cardiomyopathy–associated genes; 2 were not associated with these disorders. Four unique variants of uncertain significance cosegregated among multiple unrelated subjects with PMF. No pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">detect</span></strong>ed in ion channel–encoding genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>A large proportion of subjects with PMF at autopsy had variants in genes associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without autopsy findings of those diseases, suggesting that PMF can be an alternative phenotypic expression of structural disease–associated genetic variants or that risk-associated fibrosis was expressing before the primary disease. These findings have clinical implications for postmortem genetic testing and family risk profiling.</p></sec>

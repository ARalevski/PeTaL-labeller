Learning and attention reveal a general relationship between population activity and behavior
<p>Prior studies have demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability changes with cognitive processes that improve perceptual performance. We tested whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability covaries with subjects’ performance—whether performance improves quickly with attention or slowly with perceptual learning. We found a single, consistent relationship between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability and behavioral performance, regardless of the time frame of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability change. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability was oriented along the dimensions in population space used by the animal on a trial-by-trial basis to make decisions. That subjects’ choices were predicted by specific dimensions that were aligned with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated variability axis clarifies long-standing paradoxes about the relationship between shared variability and behavior.</p>

Correlations in high-harmonic generation of matter-wave jets revealed by pattern recognition
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations in interacting many-body systems are key to the study of quantum matter. The complexity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations typically grows quickly as the system evolves and thus presents a challenge for experimental characterization and intuitive understanding. In a strongly driven Bose-Einstein condensate, we observe the high-harmonic generation of matter-wave jets with complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations as a result of bosonic stimulation. Based on a pattern recognition scheme, we identify a pattern of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations that reveals the underlying secondary scattering processes and higher-order <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations. We show that pattern recognition offers a versatile strategy to visualize and analyze the quantum dynamics of a many-body system.</p>

Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The metal-insulator transition in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated materials is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition. This coupling not only complicates the understanding of the basic mechanism of this phenomenon but also limits the speed and endurance of prospective electronic devices. We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven metal-insulator transition in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated material, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an interface interaction suppresses the electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations without changing the crystal structure in this otherwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated insulator. This interaction stabilizes a nonequilibrium metallic phase and leads to an isostructural metal-insulator transition. This discovery will provide insights into phase transitions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated materials and may aid the design of device functionalities.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Impaired Cyclic Electron Flow around Photosystem I Disturbs High-Light Respiratory Metabolism
<p>The cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (CEF-PSI) increases ATP/NADPH production in the chloroplast, acting as an energy balance mechanism. Higher export of reducing power from the chloroplast in CEF-PSI mutants has been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with higher mitochondrial alternative oxidase (AOX) capacity and protein amount under high-light (HL) conditions. However, in vivo measurements of AOX activity are still required to confirm the exact role of AOX in dissipating the excess of reductant power from the chloroplast. Here, CEF-PSI single and double mutants were exposed to short-term HL conditions in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Chlorophyll fluorescence, in vivo activities of the cytochrome oxidase (ν<sub>cyt</sub>) and AOX (ν<sub>alt</sub>) pathways, levels of mitochondrial proteins, metabolite profiles, and pyridine nucleotide levels were determined under normal growth and HL conditions. ν<sub>alt</sub> was not increased in CEF-PSI mutants, while AOX capacity was positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with photoinhibition, probably due to a reactive oxygen species-induced increase of AOX protein. The severe metabolic impairment observed in CEF-PSI mutants, as indicated by the increase in photoinhibition and changes in the levels of stress-related metabolites, can explain their lack of ν<sub>alt</sub> induction. By contrast, ν<sub>cyt</sub> was positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with photosynthetic performance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations with metabolite changes suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> is coordinated with sugar metabolism and stress-related amino acid synthesis. Furthermore, changes in glycine-serine and NADH-NAD<sup>+</sup> ratios were highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated to ν<sub>cyt</sub>. Taken together, our results suggest that ν<sub>cyt</sub> can act as a sink for the excess of electrons from the chloroplast, probably via photorespiratory glycine oxidation, thus improving photosynthetic performance when ν<sub>alt</sub> is not induced under severe HL stress.</p>

Tuning superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene
<p>Materials with flat electronic bands often exhibit exotic quantum phenomena owing to strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations. An isolated low-energy flat band can be induced in bilayer graphene by simply rotating the layers by 1.1°, resulting in the appearance of gate-tunable superconducting and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated insulating phases. In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to the twist angle, the interlayer coupling can be varied to precisely tune these phases. We induce superconductivity at a twist angle larger than 1.1°—in which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated phases are otherwise absent—by varying the interlayer spacing with hydrostatic pressure. Our low-disorder devices reveal details about the superconducting phase diagram and its relationship to the nearby insulator. Our results demonstrate twisted bilayer graphene to be a distinctively tunable platform for exploring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated states.</p>

Coherent single-atom superradiance
<p>Superradiance is a quantum phenomenon emerging in macroscopic systems whereby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated single atoms cooperatively emit photons. Demonstration of controlled collective atom-field interactions has resulted from the ability to directly imprint <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations with an atomic ensemble. Here we report cavity-mediated coherent single-atom superradiance: Single atoms with predefined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation traverse a high–quality factor cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the <i>N</i> atoms that have already gone through the cavity (<i>N</i> represents the number of atoms). Enhanced collective photoemission of <i>N</i>-squared dependence was observed even when the intracavity atom number was less than unity. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation among single atoms was achieved by nanometer-precision position control and phase-aligned state manipulation of atoms by using a nanohole-array aperture. Our results demonstrate a platform for phase-controlled atom-field interactions.</p>

Predicting Dynamic Metabolic Demands in the Photosynthetic Eukaryote <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>
<p>Phototrophic organisms exhibit a highly dynamic proteome, adapting their biomass composition in response to diurnal light/dark cycles and nutrient availability. Here, we used experimentally determined biomass compositions over the course of growth to determine and constrain the biomass objective function (BOF) in a genome-scale metabolic model of <i>Chlorella vulgaris</i> UTEX 395 over time. Changes in the BOF, which encompasses all metabolites necessary to produce biomass, influence the state of the metabolic network thus directly affecting predictions. Simulations using dynamic BOFs predicted distinct proteome demands during heterotrophic or photoautotrophic growth. Model-driven analysis of extracellular nitrogen concentrations and predicted nitrogen uptake rates revealed an intracellular nitrogen pool, which contains 38% of the total nitrogen provided in the medium for photoautotrophic and 13% for heterotrophic growth. Agreement between flux and gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>s was determined by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ical comparison. Accordance between predicted flux <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>s and gene expression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>s was found for 65% of multisubunit enzymes and 75% of allosteric reactions. Reactions with the highest agreement between simulations and experimental data were associated with energy metabolism, terpenoid biosynthesis, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, predicted flux distributions at each time point were compared with gene expression data to gain new insights into intracellular compartmentalization, specifically for transporters. A total of 103 genes related to internal transport reactions were identified and added to the updated model of <i>C. vulgaris</i>, <i>i</i>CZ946, thus increasing our knowledgebase by 10% for this model green alga.</p>

Metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty is not associated with cardiac disease
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Many case reports and small studies have suggested that cobalt   ions are a potential cause of cardiac complications, specifically   cardiomyopathy, after metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasty   (THA). The impact of metal ions on the incidence of cardiac disease   after MoM THA has not been evaluated in large studies.

Improving 1-Year Outcomes of Infrainguinal Limb Revascularization
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The availability and diversity of lower limb revascularization procedures have increased in England in the past decade. We investigated whether these developments in care have translated to improvements in patient pathways and outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Individual-patient records from Hospital Episode Statistics were used to identify 103 934 patients who underwent endovascular (angioplasty) or surgical (endarterectomy, profundaplasty, or bypass) lower limb revascularization for infrainguinal peripheral artery disease in England between January 2006 and December 2015. Major lower limb amputations and deaths within 1 year after revascularization were ascertained from Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics mortality records. Competing risks regression was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of major amputation and death, adjusted for patient age, sex, comorbidity score, indication for the intervention (intermittent claudication, severe limb ischemia without record of tissue loss, severe limb ischemia with a record of ulceration, severe limb ischemia with a record of gangrene/osteomyelitis), and comorbid diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The estimated 1-year risk of major amputation decreased from 5.7% (in 2006–2007) to 3.9% (in 2014–2015) following endovascular revascularization, and from 11.2% (2006–2007) to 6.6% (2014–2015) following surgical procedures. The risk of death after both types of revascularization also decreased. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>s were observed for all indication categories, with the largest reductions found in patients with severe limb ischemia with ulceration or gangrene.

Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Nonshockable-Turned-Shockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) commonly presents with nonshockable rhythms (asystole and pulseless electric activity). It is unknown whether antiarrhythmic drugs are safe and effective when nonshockable rhythms evolve to shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VF/VT]) during resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with nontraumatic OHCA, vascular access, and VF/VT anytime after ≥1 shock(s) were prospectively randomized, double-blind, to receive amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo by paramedics. Patients presenting with initial shock-refractory VF/VT were previously reported. The current study was a prespecified analysis in a separate cohort that initially presented with nonshockable OHCA and was randomized on subsequently developing shock-refractory VF/VT. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included discharge functional status and adverse drug-related effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 37 889 patients with OHCA, 3026 with initial VF/VT and 1063 with initial nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were treatment-eligible, were randomized, and received their assigned drug. Baseline characteristics among patients with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Active-drug recipients in this cohort required fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned drug, and ancillary antiarrhythmic drugs than recipients of a placebo (<i>P</i><0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital discharge (<i>P</i>=0.24). No significant interaction between treatment assignment and discharge survival occurred with the initiating OHCA rhythm (asystole, pulseless electric activity, or VF/VT). Survival in each of these categories was consistently higher with active drugs, although the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>s were not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ically significant. Adjusted absolute differences (95% confidence interval) in survival from nonshockable-turned-shockable arrhythmias with amiodarone versus placebo were 2.3% (−0.3, 4.8), <i>P</i>=0.08, and for lidocaine versus placebo 1.2% (−1.1, 3.6), <i>P</i>=0.30.

Differential radial growth patterns between beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L.) and oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) on periodically waterlogged soils
<p>Climate scenarios for northern Central Europe project rising temperatures and increasing frequency and intensity of droughts but also a shift in precipitation pattern with more humid winters. This in turn may result in soil waterlogging during the following spring, leading to increasing stress for trees growing on hydric sites. The influence of waterlogging on growth of common beech and pedunculate oak has been studied intensively on seedlings under experimental conditions. However, the question remains whether results of these studies can be transferred to mature trees growing under natural conditions. To test this, we investigated general growth patterns and climate–growth relationships in four mature stands of beech and oak growing on hydromorphic soils (Stagnosols) in northeast Germany using dendrochronological methods. Our results confirmed the expected tolerance of oak to strong water-level fluctuations. Neither extremely wet conditions during spring nor summer droughts significantly affected its radial growth. Oak growth responded positively to warmer temperatures during previous year October and March of the current year of ring formation. Contrary to our expectations, also beech showed relatively low sensitivity to periods of high soil water saturation. Instead, summer drought turned out to be the main climatic factor influencing ring width of beech even under the specific periodically wet soil conditions of our study. This became evident from general climate–growth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations over the last century as well as from discontinuous (pointer year) analysis with summer drought being significantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated to the occurrence of growth depressions. As ring width of the two species is affected by differing climate parameters, species-specific chronologies show no coherence in high-frequency variations even for trees growing in close proximity. We assume differences in rooting depth as the main reason for the differing growth patterns and climate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations of the two species under study. Our results indicate that under the projected future climate scenarios, beech may suffer from increasing drought stress even on hydromorphic soils. Oak might be able to maintain a sufficient hydraulic status during summer droughts by reaching water in deeper soil strata with its root system. Wet phases with waterlogged soil conditions during spring or summer appear to have only a little direct influence on radial growth of both species.</p>

Recovery performance in xylem hydraulic conductivity is correlated with cavitation resistance for temperate deciduous tree species
<p>Woody species hydraulically vulnerable to xylem cavitation may experience daily xylem embolism. How such species cope with the possibility of accumulated embolism is unclear. In this study, we examined seven temperate woody species to assess the hypothesis that low cavitation resistance (high vulnerability to cavitation) is compensated by high recovery performance via vessel refilling. We also evaluated leaf functional and xylem structural traits. The xylem recovery index (XRI), defined as the ratio of xylem hydraulic conductivity in plants rewatered after soil drought to that in plants under moist conditions, varied among species. The xylem water potential causing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (Ψ<sub>50</sub>) varied among the species studied, whereas only a slight difference was detected with respect to midday xylem water potential (Ψ<sub>min</sub>), indicating smaller hydraulic safety margins (Ψ<sub>min</sub> − Ψ<sub>50</sub>) for species more vulnerable to cavitation. Cavitation resistance (|Ψ<sub>50</sub>|) was negatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with XRI across species, with cavitation-vulnerable species showing a higher performance in xylem recovery. Wood density was positively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with cavitation resistance and was negatively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with XRI. These novel results reveal that coordination exists between cavitation resistance and xylem recovery performance, in association with wood functional traits such as denser wood for cavitation-resistant xylem and less-dense but water-storable wood for refillable xylem. These findings provide insights into long-term maintenance of water transport in tree species growing under variable environmental conditions.</p>

The analysis uses an extensive database obtained from 31 satellite missions comprising three types of instruments—altimeters, radiometers, and scatterometers. The analysis shows small increases in mean wind speed and significant wave height over this period, with larger increases in extreme conditions (90th percentiles). The largest increases occur in the Southern Ocean. Confidence in the results is strengthened because the wind speed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>s are confirmed by all three satellite systems. An extensive set of sensitivity analyses confirms that both the mean and 90th percentile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>s are robust, with only small impacts caused by satellite calibration and sampling patterns.</p>

We observed and thoroughly analyzed the rich strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated physics in two profoundly dissimilar regimes of quantum criticality. With a circuit implementing a quantum simulator for the three-channel Kondo model, we reveal the universal scalings toward different low-temperature fixed points and along the multiple crossovers from quantum criticality. An unanticipated violation of the maximum conductance for ballistic free electrons is uncovered. The present charge pseudospin implementation of a Kondo impurity opens access to a broad variety of strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated phenomena.</p>

Random heteropolymers preserve protein function in foreign environments
<p>The successful incorporation of active proteins into synthetic polymers could lead to a new class of materials with functions found only in living systems. However, proteins rarely function under the conditions suitable for polymer processing. On the basis of an analysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>s in protein sequences and characteristic chemical patterns on protein surfaces, we designed four-monomer random heteropolymers to mimic intrinsically disordered proteins for protein solubilization and stabilization in non-native environments. The heteropolymers, with optimized composition and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ical monomer distribution, enable cell-free synthesis of membrane proteins with proper protein folding for transport and enzyme-containing plastics for toxin bioremediation. Controlling the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ical monomer distribution in a heteropolymer, rather than the specific monomer sequence, affords a new strategy to interface with biological systems for protein-based biomaterials.</p>

High-temperature pairing in a strongly interacting two-dimensional Fermi gas
<p>The nature of the normal phase of strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated fermionic systems is an outstanding question in quantum many-body physics. We used spatially resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure pairing energy of fermions across a wide range of temperatures and interaction strengths in a two-dimensional gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We observed many-body pairing at temperatures far above the critical temperature for superfluidity. In the strongly interacting regime, the pairing energy in the normal phase considerably exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing in this regime is driven by many-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations, rather than two-body physics. Our findings show that pairing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations in strongly interacting two-dimensional fermionic systems are remarkably robust against thermal fluctuations.</p>

Maxima in the thermodynamic response and correlation functions of deeply supercooled water
<p>Femtosecond x-ray laser pulses were used to probe micrometer-sized water droplets that were cooled down to 227 kelvin in vacuum. Isothermal compressibility and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation length were extracted from x-ray scattering at the low–momentum transfer region. The temperature dependence of these thermodynamic response and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation functions shows maxima at 229 kelvin for water and 233 kelvin for heavy water. In addition, we observed that the liquids undergo the fastest growth of tetrahedral structures at similar temperatures. These observations point to the existence of a Widom line, defined as the locus of maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation length emanating from a critical point at positive pressures in the deeply supercooled regime. The difference in the maximum value of the isothermal compressibility between the two isotopes shows the importance of nuclear quantum effects.</p>

Antibody-dependent enhancement of severe dengue disease in humans
<p>For dengue viruses 1 to 4 (DENV1-4), a specific range of antibody titer has been shown to enhance viral replication in vitro and severe disease in animal models. Although suspected, such antibody-dependent enhancement of severe disease has not been shown to occur in humans. Using multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ical approaches to study a long-term pediatric cohort in Nicaragua, we show that risk of severe dengue disease is highest within a narrow range of preexisting anti-DENV antibody titers. By contrast, we observe protection from all symptomatic dengue disease at high antibody titers. Thus, immune <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ates of severe dengue must be evaluated separately from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ates of protection against symptomatic disease. These results have implications for studies of dengue pathogenesis and for vaccine development, because enhancement, not just lack of protection, is of concern.</p>

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators
<p>Topological phases, like the Haldane phase in spin-1 chains, defy characterization through local order parameters. Instead, nonlocal string order parameters can be employed to reveal their hidden order. Similar diluted magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of spin-charge separation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden magnetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations via quantum gas microscopy of hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains. The measurement of nonlocal spin-density <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation functions reveals a hidden finite-range antiferromagnetic order, a direct consequence of spin-charge separation. Our technique, which measures nonlocal order directly, can be readily extended to higher dimensions to study the complex interplay between magnetic order and density fluctuations.</p>

Two- and three-body contacts in the unitary Bose gas
<p>In many-body systems governed by pairwise contact interactions, a wide range of observables is linked by a single parameter, the two-body contact, which quantifies two-particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations. This profound insight has transformed our understanding of strongly interacting Fermi gases. Using Ramsey interferometry, we studied coherent evolution of the resonantly interacting Bose gas, and we show here that it cannot be explained by only pairwise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations. Our experiments reveal the crucial role of three-body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations arising from Efimov physics and provide a direct measurement of the associated three-body contact.</p>

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) isotope compositions in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative conditions in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen isotope composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. Isotope compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fraction, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this isotope can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

Hornwort Stomata: Architecture and Fate Shared with 400-Million-Year-Old Fossil Plants without Leaves
<p>As one of the earliest plant groups to evolve stomata, hornworts are key to understanding the origin and function of stomata. Hornwort stomata are large and scattered on sporangia that grow from their bases and release spores at their tips. We present data from development and immunocytochemistry that identify a role for hornwort stomata that is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with sporangial and spore maturation. We measured guard cells across the genera with stomata to assess developmental changes in size and to analyze any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation with genome size. Stomata form at the base of the sporophyte in the green region, where they develop differential wall thickenings, form a pore, and die. Guard cells collapse inwardly, increase in surface area, and remain perched over a substomatal cavity and network of intercellular spaces that is initially fluid filled. Following pore formation, the sporophyte dries from the outside inwardly and continues to do so after guard cells die and collapse. Spore tetrads develop in spore mother cell walls within a mucilaginous matrix, both of which progressively dry before sporophyte dehiscence. A lack of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation between guard cell size and DNA content, lack of arabinans in cell walls, and perpetually open pores are consistent with the inactivity of hornwort stomata. Stomata are expendable in hornworts, as they have been lost twice in derived taxa. Guard cells and epidermal cells of hornworts show striking similarities with the earliest plant fossils. Our findings identify an architecture and fate of stomata in hornworts that is ancient and common to plants without sporophytic leaves.</p>

Validating Genome-Wide Association Candidates Controlling Quantitative Variation in Nodulation
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) studies offer the opportunity to identify genes that contribute to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. However, GWA relies exclusively on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ical association, so functional validation is necessary to make strong claims about gene function. We used a combination of gene-disruption platforms (Tnt1 retrotransposons, hairpin RNA-interference constructs, and CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases) together with randomized, well-replicated experiments to evaluate the function of genes that an earlier GWA study in <i>Medicago truncatula</i> had identified as candidates contributing to variation in the symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. We evaluated ten candidate genes found in six clusters of strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, selected on the basis of their strength of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ical association, proximity to annotated gene models, and root or nodule expression. We found <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ically significant effects on nodule production for three candidate genes, each validated in two independent mutants. Annotated functions of these three genes suggest their contributions to quantitative variation in nodule production occur through processes not previously connected to nodulation, including phosphorous supply and salicylic acid-related defense response. These results demonstrate the utility of GWA combined with reverse mutagenesis technologies to discover and validate genes contributing to naturally occurring variation in quantitative traits. The results highlight the potential for GWA to complement forward genetics in identifying the genetic basis of ecologically and economically important traits.</p>

Mediolateral force distribution at the knee joint shifts across activities and is driven by tibiofemoral alignment
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Tibiofemoral alignment is important to determine the rate of   progression of osteoarthritis and implant survival after total knee   arthroplasty (TKA). Normally, surgeons aim for neutral tibiofemoral   alignment following TKA, but this has been questioned in recent   years.

Medial force ratios were   analysed during nine daily activities, including activities with   single-limb support (e.g. walking) and double-limb support (e.g.   knee bend).

In contrast,   the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation between leg alignment and magnitude of medial compartment force   was much less pronounced.

Right Ventricular Myofilament Functional Differences in Humans With Systemic Sclerosis–Associated Versus Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)–associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have a far worse prognosis than those with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). In the intact heart, SSc-PAH exhibits depressed rest and reserve right ventricular (RV) contractility compared with IPAH. We tested whether this disparity involves underlying differences in myofilament function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac myocytes were isolated from RV septal endomyocardial biopsies from patients with SSc-PAH, IPAH, or SSc with exertional dyspnea but no resting PAH (SSc-d); control RV septal tissue was obtained from nondiseased donor hearts (6–7 per group). Isolated myocyte passive length-tension and developed tension-calcium relationships were determined and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated with in vivo RV function and reserve. RV septal fibrosis was also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Myocyte passive stiffness from length-tension relations was similarly increased in IPAH and SSc-PAH compared with control, although SSc-PAH biopsies had more interstitial fibrosis. More striking disparities were found between active force-calcium relations. Compared with controls, maximal calcium-activated force (F<sub>max</sub>) was 28% higher in IPAH but 37% lower in SSc-PAH. F<sub>max</sub> in SSc-d was intermediate between control and SSc-PAH. The calcium concentration required for half-maximal force (EC<sub>50</sub>) was similar between control, IPAH, and SSc-d but lower in SSc-PAH. This disparity disappeared in myocytes incubated with the active catalytic subunit of protein kinase A.

We studied RUNX1 binding to the <i>PCTP</i> promoter using DNA-protein binding studies and human erythroleukemia cells and promoter activity using luciferase reporter studies.

Three Arterial Grafts Improve Late Survival
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Little evidence shows whether a third arterial graft provides superior outcomes compared with the use of 2 arterial grafts in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. A meta-analysis of all the propensity score-matched observational studies comparing the long-term outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting with the use of 2-arterial versus 3-arterial grafts was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science to identify relevant articles. Long-term mortality in the propensity score-matched populations was the primary end point. Secondary end points were in-hospital/30-day mortality for the propensity score-matched populations and long-term mortality for the unmatched populations. In the matched population, time-to-event outcome for long-term mortality was extracted as hazard ratios, along with their variance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ical pooling of survival (time-to-event) was performed according to a random effect model, computing risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight propensity score-matched studies reporting on 10 287 matched patients (2-arterial graft: 5346; 3-arterial graft: 4941) were selected for final comparison. The mean follow-up time ranged from 37.2 to 196.8 months. The use of 3 arterial grafts was not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ically associated with early mortality (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–1.22; <i>P</i>=0.62). The use of 3 arterial grafts was associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ically significantly lower hazard for late death (hazard ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.87; <i>P</i><0.001), irrespective of sex and diabetic mellitus status. This result was qualitatively similar in the unmatched population (hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–0.98; <i>P</i>=0.04).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The use of a third arterial conduit in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting is not associated with higher operative risk and is associated with superior long-term survival, irrespective of sex and diabetic mellitus status.</p></sec>

Effect of Race and Ethnicity on Outcomes With Drug-Eluting and Bare Metal Stents
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients have been underrepresented in percutaneous coronary intervention clinical trials; therefore, there are limited data available on outcomes for these race/ethnicity groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>We examined outcomes in 423 965 patients in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry database linked to Medicare claims for follow-up. Within each race/ethnicity group, we examined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>s in drug-eluting stent (DES) use, 30-month outcomes, and relative outcomes of DES versus bare metal stents. Overall, 390 351 white, 20 191 black, 9342 Hispanic, and 4171 Asian patients > 65 years of age underwent stent implantation from 2004 through 2008 at 940 National Cardiovascular Data Registry participating sites. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>s in adoption of DES were similar across all groups. Relative to whites, black and Hispanic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention had higher long-term risks of death and myocardial infarction (blacks: hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.24–1.32; Hispanics: hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–1.21). Long-term outcomes were similar in Asians and whites (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.92–1.08). Use of DES was associated with better 30-month survival and lower myocardial infarction rates compared with the use of bare metal stents among all race/ethnicity groups except Hispanics, who had similar outcomes with DES or bare metal stents.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Black and Hispanic patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention had worse long-term outcomes relative to white and Asian patients. Compared with bare metal stent use, DES use was generally associated with superior long-term outcomes in all racial and ethnic groups, although these differences were not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ically significant in Hispanic patients.</p></sec>

The validity and reproducibility of cross table radiographs compared with CT scans for the measurement of anteversion of the acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility and validity   of cross table radiographs for measuring the anteversion of the   acetabular component after total hip arthroplasty (THA) and to compare   it with measurements using CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 29 patients who underwent THA between June 2010 and   January 2016 were included. There were 17 men and 12 women. Their   mean age was 43 years (26 to 65). Seven patients underwent a bilateral   procedure. Thus, 36 THAs were included in the study. Lateral radiographs   and CT scans were obtained post-operatively and radiographs repeated   three weeks later. The anteversion of the acetabular component was   measured using the method described by Woo and Morrey and the ischiolateral   method described by Pulos et al and these were compared with the   results obtained from CT scans.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean anteversion was 18.35° (3° to 38°) using Woo and Morrey’s   method, 51.45° (30° to 85°) using the ischiolateral method and 21.22°   (2° to 48°) using CT scans. The Pearson <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation coefficient   was 0.754 for Woo and Morrey’s method and 0.925 for the ischiolateral   method. There was a linear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation between the measurements   using the ischiolateral method and those using CT scans. We derived   a simple linear equation between the value of the CT scan and that   of ischiolateral method to deduce the CT scan value from that of ischiolateral   method and <i>vice versa</i>. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The anteversion of the acetabular component measured using both   plain radiographic methods was consistently valid with good interobserver   reproducibility, but the ischiolateral method which is independent   of pelvic tilt was more accurate. As CT is costly, associated with   a high dose of radiation and not readily available, the ischiolateral method   can be used for assessing the anteversion of the acetabular component.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1006–11.</p></sec>

A long-term follow-up study of the clinical and radiographic outcome of distal trochanteric transfer in Legg-Calvé-Perthes’ disease following varus derotational osteotomy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To assess the long-term effect of distal trochanteric transfer   (DTT) on the clinical and radiographic outcomes of patients with   Legg-Calvé-Perthes’ disease (LCPD) following a varus derotational   osteotomy (VDRO).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>For this single centre cross-sectional retrospective study we   analysed the data of 22 patients (24 hips) with LCPD who had greater   trochanteric overgrowth (GTO), following a VDRO performed in our   institution between 1959 and 1983. GTO was defined as an articular   trochanteric distance (ATD) of < 5 mm. We compared the radiographic   and clinical outcomes of patients who underwent DTT for GTO (ten   patients, ten hips) with those who did not (12 patients, 14 hips).   Age at presentation was 6.9 years (4 to 10) and 8.0 years (3.2 to   12) respectively. Symptoms associated with the hip and general quality   of life were assessed using the Harris hip score (HHS) and the Short Form   (SF)-36 questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At long-term follow-up of the DTT group, the ATD was 21.7 mm   (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 9.8) and the centro-trochanteric   distance (CTD) was 13.8 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 8.3). In the control group   the ATD was -0.6 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 7.8) and the CTD was 32.5 mm (<sc>sd</sc> 10.2).

Prediction of the pre-morbid 3D anatomy of the proximal humerus based on statistical shape modelling
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Restoring the pre-morbid anatomy of the proximal humerus is a   goal of anatomical shoulder arthroplasty, but reliance is placed   on the surgeon’s experience and on anatomical estimations. The purpose   of this study was to present a novel method, ‘<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ical Shape   Modelling’, which accurately predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy   and calculates the 3D geometric parameters needed to restore normal   anatomy in patients with severe degenerative osteoarthritis or a   fracture of the proximal humerus.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>From a database of 57 humeral CT scans 3D humeral reconstructions   were manually created. The reconstructions were used to construct   a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ical shape model (SSM), which was then tested on a second   set of 52 scans. For each humerus in the second set, 3D reconstructions   of four diaphyseal segments of varying lengths were created. These   reconstructions were chosen to mimic severe osteoarthritis, a fracture   of the surgical neck of the humerus and a proximal humeral fracture   with diaphyseal extension. The SSM was then applied to the diaphyseal   segments to see how well it predicted proximal morphology, using   the actual proximal humeral morphology for comparison.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the errors   of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature   and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were   2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm),   0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the   metaphysis excluded, mimicking a fracture of the surgical neck,   the errors of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius   of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the   humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3   mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm    (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study reports a novel, computerised method that accurately   predicts the pre-morbid proximal humeral anatomy even in challenging   situations.

Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic in total knee arthroplasty; is posterior capsular infiltration worth the risk?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic provides effective   control of pain in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).   There is little information about the added benefits of posterior   capsular infiltration (PCI) using different combinations of local   anaesthetic agents. Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness   of the control of pain using multimodal infiltration with and without   infiltration of the posterior capsule of the knee.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial of patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">schedul</span></strong>ed   for unilateral primary TKA, 86 were assigned to be treated with   multimodal infiltration with (Group I) or without (Group II) PCI.   Routine associated analgesia included the use of bupivacaine, morphine,   ketorolac and epinephrine. All patients had spinal anaesthesia and patient-controlled   analgesia (PCA) post-operatively. A visual analogue scale (VAS)   for pain and the use of morphine were recorded 24 hours post-operatively.   Side effects of the infiltration, blood loss, and length of stay   in hospital were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ically significant differences between the   groups in relation to: VAS pain scores in the first 24 hours post-operatively   (p = 0.693), the use of morphine in the PCA (p = 0.647), blood loss   (p = 0.625), and length of stay (p = 0.17). There were no neurovascular   complications in either group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The multimodal infiltration of local anaesthetic with infiltration   of the posterior capsule did not provide significant added analgesic   benefits or reduce the use of morphine after TKA.

Pre-operative functional mobility as an independent determinant of inpatient functional recovery after total knee arthroplasty during three periods that coincided with changes in clinical pathways
<sec><title>Aims </title><p>To investigate whether pre-operative functional mobility is a   determinant of delayed inpatient recovery of activities (IRoA) after   total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in three periods that coincided with   changes in the clinical pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients (n = 682, 73% women, mean age 70 years, standard   deviation 9) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">schedul</span></strong>ed for TKA between 2009 and 2015 were pre-operatively   screened for functional mobility by the Timed-up-and-Go test (TUG)   and De Morton mobility index (DEMMI).

Functional outcomes of conservatively managed acute ruptures of the Achilles tendon
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This prospective cohort study aims to determine if the size of   the tendon gap following acute rupture of the Achilles tendon shows   an association with the functional outcome following non-operative   treatment. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>All patients presenting within two weeks of an acute unilateral   rupture of the Achilles tendon between July 2012 and July 2015 were   considered for the study. In total, 38 patients (nine female, 29   male, mean age 52 years; 29 to 78) completed the study. Dynamic   ultrasound examination was performed to confirm the diagnosis and   measure the gap between ruptured tendon ends. Outcome was assessed   using dynamometric testing of plantarflexion and the Achilles tendon   Total Rupture score (ATRS) six months after the completion of a   rehabilitation programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients with a gap ≥ 10 mm with the ankle in the neutral position   had significantly greater peak torque deficit than those with gaps   < 10 mm (mean 23.3%; 7% to 52% <i>vs </i>14.3%; 0% to   47%, p = 0.023). However, there was no difference   in ATRS between the two groups (mean score 87.2; 74 to 100 <i>vs</i> 87.4;   68 to 97, p = 0.467). There was no significant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation between   gap size and torque deficit (τ = 0.103), suggesting a non-linear relationship.

Minimising aseptic loosening in extreme bone resections
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the resection of an extensive amount of bone in the   treatment of a tumour, the residual segment may be insufficient   to accept a standard length intramedullary cemented stem. Short-stemmed   endoprostheses conceivably have an increased risk of aseptic loosening.   Extra-cortical plates have been added to minimise this risk by supplementing   fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate the survivorship   of short-stemmed endoprostheses and extra-cortical plates.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study involved 37 patients who underwent limb salvage surgery   for a primary neoplasm of bone between 1998 and 2013. Endoprosthetic   replacement involved the proximal humerus in nine, the proximal   femur in nine, the distal femur in 13 and the proximal tibia in   six patients. There were 12 primary (32%) and 25 revision procedures (68%).   Implant survivorship was compared with matched controls. The amount   of bone that was resected was > 70% of its length and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ically   greater than the standard control group at each anatomical site.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was seven years (one to 17). The mean length   of the stem was 33 mm (20 to 60) in the humerus and 79 mm (34 to   100) in the lower limb. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of the   implant according to anatomical site confirmed that there was no   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ically significant difference between the short-stemmed endoprostheses and   the standard stemmed controls at the proximal humeral (p = 0.84),   proximal femoral (p = 0.57), distal femoral (p = 0.21) and proximal   tibial (p = 0.61) sites.</p><p>In the short-stemmed group, no implants with extra-cortical plate   osseointegration suffered loosening at a mean of 8.5 years (range   2 to 16 years).

Clinical, functional and radiological outcomes of extracorporeal irradiation in limb salvage surgery for bone tumours
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>We present a retrospective review of patients treated with extracorporeally   irradiated allografts for primary and secondary bone tumours with   the mid- and long-term survivorship and the functional and radiographic   outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 113 of 116 (97.4%) patients who were treated with   extracorporeally irradiated allografts between 1996 and 2014 were   followed up.

Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Musculoskeletal Tumor   Society (MSTS) scoring system, the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score   (TESS) and Quality of Life-C30 (QLQ-30) measures. Radiographic outcomes   were assessed using the International Society of Limb Salvage (ISOLS)   radiographic scoring system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 61 (54%) men with a mean age of 22 years (6 to 70)   and 52 (46%) women with a mean age of 26 years (3 to 85). There   were 23 deaths. The five-year patient survivorship was 82.3% and   the ten-year patient survivorship was 79.6%. The mean follow-up   of the 90 surviving patients was 80.3 months (2 to 207). At the   last follow-up, 105 allografts (92.9%) were still in place or had   been at the time of death; eight (7%) had failed due to infection,   local recurrence or fracture. Outcome scores were comparable with   or superior to those in previous studies. The mean outcome scores   were: MSTS 79% (<sc>sd</sc> 8); TESS 83% (<sc>sd</sc> 19); QLQ 82%   (<sc>sd</sc> 16); ISOLS 80.5% (<sc>sd</sc> 19). </p><p>Pearson <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation analysis showed a strong relationship between   the MSTS and ISOLS scores (r = 0.71, p < 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that extracorporeal irradiation is a versatile   reconstructive technique for dealing with large defects after the   resection of bone tumours with good functional and radiographic   outcomes.

Ageing, deep vein thrombosis and male gender predict poor outcome after acute Achilles tendon rupture
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Patients with an acute Achilles tendon rupture (ATR) take a long   time to heal, have a high incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)   and widely variable functional outcomes. This variation in outcome   may be explained by a lack of knowledge of adverse factors, and   a subsequent shortage of appropriate interventions. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 111 patients (95 men, 16 women; mean age 40.3, standard   deviation 8.4) with an acute total ATR were prospectively assessed.   At one year post-operatively a uniform outcome score, Achilles Combined   Outcome Score (ACOS), was obtained by combining three validated,   independent, outcome measures: Achilles tendon Total Rupture Score,   heel-rise height test, and limb symmetry heel-rise height. Predictors   of ACOS included treatment; gender; age; smoking; body mass index;   time to surgery; physical activity level pre- and post-injury; symptoms; quality   of life and incidence of DVT. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were three independent variables that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ated significantly   with the dichotomised outcome score (ACOS), while there was no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">correl</span></strong>ation   with other factors. An age of less than 40 years old was the strongest   independent predictor of a good outcome one year after ATR (odds   ratio (OR) 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.51), followed   by female gender (OR) 4.18, 95% CI 1.01 to 17.24). Notably, patients   who did not have a DVT while immobilised post-operatively had a   better outcome (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.80). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Over the age of 40 years, male gender and having a DVT while   immobilised are independent negative predictors of outcome in patients   with an acute ATR. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2016;98-B:1635–41.</p></sec>

A functional comparison of medial pivot and condylar knee designs based on patient outcomes and parameters of gait
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The outcome of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is not always satisfactory.   The purpose of this study was to identify satisfaction and biomechanical   features characterising the gait of patients who had undergone TKA   with either an anatomical single radius design or a medial pivot   design. We hypothesised that the latter would provide superior function.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a study of a subset of patients recruited into a prospective   randomised study of a single radius design <i>versus </i>a   medial pivot design, with a minimum follow-up of one year. Outcome   measurements included clinical scores (Knee Society Score (KSS)   and Oxford Knee Score (OKS)) and gait analysis using an instrumented   treadmill.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ically significant difference between the   two groups for both the KSS and OKS.

The risk of cardiac failure following metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with   metal-on-metal (MoM) arthroplasties of the hip have an increased   risk of cardiac failure compared with those with alternative types   of arthroplasties (non-MoM).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A linkage study between the National Joint Registry, Hospital   Episodes Statistics and records of the Office for National Statistics   on deaths was undertaken. Patients who underwent elective total   hip arthroplasty between January 2003 and December 2014 with no   past history of cardiac failure were included and stratified as   having either a MoM (n = 53 529) or a non-MoM (n = 482 247) arthroplasty.   The primary outcome measure was the time to an admission to hospital   for cardiac failure or death. Analysis was carried out using data   from all patients and from those matched by propensity score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The risk of cardiac failure was lower in the MoM cohort compared   with the non-MoM cohort (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.901; 95%   confidence interval (CI) 0.853 to 0.953). The risk of cardiac failure   was similar following matching (aHR 0.909; 95% CI 0.838 to 0.987)   and the findings were consistent in subgroup analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The risk of cardiac failure following total hip arthroplasty   was not increased in those in whom MoM implants were used, compared   with those in whom other types of prostheses were used, in the first   seven years after surgery.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:20–7.</p></sec>

Residual Inflammatory Risk on Treatment With PCSK9 Inhibition and Statin Therapy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The combination of statin therapy and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibition markedly lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduces cardiovascular event rates. Whether residual inflammatory risk as measured by on-treatment high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) remains an important clinical issue in such patients is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We evaluated residual inflammatory risk among 9738 patients participating in the SPIRE-1 and SPIRE-2 cardiovascular outcomes trials (Studies of PCSK9 Inhibition and the Reduction in Vascular Events), who were receiving both statin therapy and bococizumab, according to on-treatment levels of hsCRP (hsCRP<sub>OT</sub>) and LDL-C<sub>OT</sub> measured 14 weeks after drug initiation. The primary end point was nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina requiring urgent revascularization, or cardiovascular death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At 14 weeks, the mean percentage change in LDL-C among statin-treated patients who additionally received bococizumab was −60.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], −61.2 to −59.8; <i>P</i><0.001; median change, −65.4%) as compared to 6.6% (95% CI, −1.0 to 14.1; <i>P</i>=0.09; median change, 0.0%) for hsCRP. Incidence rates for future cardiovascular events for patients treated with both statin therapy and bococizumab according to hsCRP<sub>OT</sub> <1, 1 to 3, and >3 mg/L were 1.96, 2.50, and 3.59 events per 100 person-years, respectively, corresponding to multivariable adjusted hazard ratios of 1.0, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.81–1.66), and 1.62 (95% CI, 1.14–2.30) (<i>P</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>=0.001) after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and LDL-C<sub>OT</sub>. Comparable adjusted hazard ratios for LDL-C<sub>OT</sub> (<30, 30–50, >50 mg/dL) were 1.0, 0.87, and 1.21, respectively (<i>P</i>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>=0.16). Relative risk reductions with bococizumab were similar across hsCRP<sub>OT</sub> groups (<i>P</i>-interaction=0.87).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this post hoc analysis of the SPIRE trials of bococizumab in a stable outpatient population, evidence of residual inflammatory risk persisted among patients treated with both statin therapy and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Trends in Hospitalizations and Survival of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure in Four US Communities (2005–2014)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Community <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>s of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in diverse populations may differ by race and sex.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) sampled heart failure-related hospitalizations (≥55 years of age) in 4 US communities from 2005 to 2014 using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. ADHF hospitalizations were validated by standardized physician review and computer algorithm, yielding 40 173 events after accounting for sampling design (unweighted n=8746).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the ADHF hospitalizations, 50% had reduced ejection fraction, and 39% had preserved EF (HFpEF). HF with reduced ejection fraction was more common in black men and white men, whereas HFpEF was most common in white women. Average age-adjusted rates of ADHF were highest in blacks (38.1 per 1000 black men, 30.5 per 1000 black women), with rates differing by HF type and sex. ADHF rates increased over the 10 years (average annual percentage change: black women +4.3%, black men +3.7%, white women +1.9%, white men +2.6%), mostly reflecting more acute HFpEF. Age-adjusted 28-day and 1-year case fatality proportions were ≈10% and 30%, respectively, similar across race-sex groups and HF types. Only blacks showed decreased 1-year mortality over time (average annual percentage change: black women –5.4%, black men –4.6%), with rates differing by HF type (average annual percentage change: black women HFpEF –7.1%, black men HF with reduced ejection fraction –4.7%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Between 2005 and 2014, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">trend</span></strong>s in ADHF hospitalizations increased in 4 US communities, primarily driven by acute HFpEF. Survival at 1 year was poor regardless of EF but improved over time for black women and black men.</p></sec>

Canagliflozin for Primary and Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor that significantly reduces the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and elevated cardiovascular risk. The comparative effects among participants with and without a history of cardiovascular disease (secondary versus primary prevention) were prespecified for evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The CANVAS Program (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) randomly assigned 10 142 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus to canagliflozin or placebo. The primary prevention cohort comprised individuals ≥50 years of age with ≥2 risk factors for cardiovascular events but with no prior cardiovascular event, and the secondary prevention cohort comprised individuals ≥30 years of age with a prior cardiovascular event. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Secondary outcomes included heart failure hospitalization and a renal composite (40% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, renal replacement therapy, or renal death).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Primary prevention participants (N=3486; 34%) were younger (63 versus 64 years of age), were more often female (45% versus 31%), and had a longer duration of diabetes mellitus (14 versus 13 years) compared with secondary prevention participants (N=6656; 66%). The primary end point event rate was higher in the secondary prevention group compared with the primary prevention group (36.9 versus 15.7/1000 patient-years, <i>P</i><0.001). In the total cohort, the primary end point was reduced with canagliflozin compared with placebo (26.9 versus 31.5/1000 patient-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75–0.97; <i>P</i><0.001 for noninferiority, <i>P</i>=0.02 for superiority) with no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ical evidence of heterogeneity (interaction <i>P</i> value=0.18) between the primary (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.74–1.30) and secondary prevention (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.95) cohorts. Renal outcomes (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44–0.79 versus HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.39–1.02; interaction <i>P</i> value=0.73) and heart failure hospitalization (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51–0.90 versus HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.35–1.15; interaction <i>P</i> value=0.91) were similarly reduced in the secondary and primary prevention cohorts, respectively. Lower extremity amputations were similarly increased in the secondary and primary prevention cohorts (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.43–3.00 versus HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.70–3.29; interaction <i>P</i> value=0.63).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and prior cardiovascular events had higher rates of cardiovascular outcomes compared with the primary prevention patients. Canagliflozin reduced cardiovascular and renal outcomes with no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">statist</span></strong>ical evidence of heterogeneity of the treatment effect across the primary and secondary prevention groups.

Axon degeneration and PGC-1α-mediated protection in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein toxicity
<p>α-synuclein (aSyn) expression is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In animal models of these diseases, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> pathology often precedes cell death, raising the question of whether aSyn has compartment-specific toxic effects that could require early and/or independent therapeutic intervention. The relevance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al pathology to degeneration can only be addressed through longitudinal, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of different neuronal compartments. With current imaging methods, dopaminergic neurons do not readily lend themselves to such a task in any vertebrate system. We therefore expressed human wild-type aSyn in zebrafish peripheral sensory neurons, which project elaborate superficial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s that can be continuously imaged <i>in vivo</i>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al outgrowth was normal in these neurons but, by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), many aSyn-expressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s became dystrophic, with focal varicosities or diffuse beading. Approximately 20% of aSyn-expressing cells died by 3 dpf. Time-lapse imaging revealed that focal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al swelling, but not overt fragmentation, usually preceded cell death. Co-expressing aSyn with a mitochondrial reporter revealed deficits in mitochondrial transport and morphology even when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s appeared overtly normal. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>-protective protein Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> degeneration but not cell death caused by aSyn. By contrast, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which has roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive-oxygen-species detoxification, abrogated aSyn toxicity in both the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> and the cell body. The rapid onset of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al pathology in this system, and the relatively moderate degree of cell death, provide a new model for the study of aSyn toxicity and protection. Moreover, the accessibility of peripheral sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s will allow effects of aSyn to be studied in different neuronal compartments and might have utility in screening for novel disease-modifying compounds.</p>

Branch-restricted localization of phosphatase Prl-1 specifies axonal synaptogenesis domains
<p>Central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system (CNS) circuit development requires subcellular control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and patterning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e abundance. We identified the <i>Drosophila</i> membrane-anchored phosphatase of regenerating liver (Prl-1) as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>-intrinsic factor that promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation in a spatially restricted fashion. The loss of Prl-1 in mechanosensory neurons reduced the number of CNS pre<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es localized on a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> collateral and organized as a terminal arbor. Flies lacking all Prl-1 protein had locomotor defects. The overexpression of Prl-1 induced ectopic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. In mechanosensory neurons, Prl-1 modulates the insulin receptor (InR) signaling pathway within a single contralateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> compartment, thereby affecting the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> branch–specific localization and function of Prl-1 depend on untranslated regions of the <i>prl-1</i> messenger RNA (mRNA). Therefore, compartmentalized restriction of Prl-1 serves as a specificity factor for the subcellular control of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al synaptogenesis.</p>

Development
The p21-activated kinase Mbt is a component of the apical protein complex in central brain neuroblasts and controls cell proliferation
<p>The final size of the central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system is determined by precisely controlled generation, proliferation and death of neural stem cells. We show here that the <i>Drosophila</i> PAK protein Mushroom bodies tiny (Mbt) is expressed in central brain progenitor cells (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuroblast</span></strong>s) and becomes enriched to the apical cortex of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuroblast</span></strong>s in a cell cycle- and Cdc42-dependent manner. Using mushroom body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuroblast</span></strong>s as a model system, we demonstrate that in the absence of Mbt function, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuroblast</span></strong>s and their progeny are correctly specified and are able to generate different neuron subclasses as in the wild type, but are impaired in their proliferation activity throughout development. In general, loss of Mbt function does not interfere with establishment or maintenance of cell polarity, orientation of the mitotic spindle and organization of the actin or tubulin cytoskeleton in central brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuroblast</span></strong>s. However, we show that <i>mbt</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuroblast</span></strong>s are significantly reduced in cell size during different stages of development, which is most pronounced for mushroom body <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuroblast</span></strong>s. This phenotype correlates with reduced mitotic activity throughout development. Additionally, postembryonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuroblast</span></strong>s are lost prematurely owing to apoptosis. Yet, preventing apoptosis did not rescue the loss of neurons seen in the adult mushroom body of <i>mbt</i> mutants. From these results, we conclude that Mbt is part of a regulatory network that is required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuroblast</span></strong> growth and thereby allows proper proliferation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuroblast</span></strong>s throughout development.</p>

Cholesterol crystals impede nerve repair
<p>Damage to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong> sheath that surrounds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s represents the pathological hallmark of the neurological disorder multiple sclerosis (MS) and is thought to contribute to a number of other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system maladies (<i>1</i>).

Activation of CaMKIV by soluble amyloid-β<sub>1–42</sub> impedes trafficking of axonal vesicles and impairs activity-dependent synaptogenesis
<p>The prefibrillar form of soluble amyloid-β (sAβ<sub>1–42</sub>) impairs synaptic function and is associated with the early phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We investigated how sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> led to presynaptic defects using a quantum dot–based, single particle–tracking method to monitor synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s. We found that sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> prevented new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation induced by chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, nanomolar amounts of sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance from presynaptic terminals and increased the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. This caused an increase in the phosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) and its substrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in, which markedly inhibited SV trafficking along <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. Neurons derived from a transgenic AD mouse model had similar defects, which were prevented by an inhibitor of CaMK kinase (CaMKK; which activates CaMKIV), by antibodies against Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>, or by expression a phosphodeficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>in mutant. The CaMKK inhibitor also abolished the defects in activity-dependent synaptogenesis caused by sAβ<sub>1–42</sub>. Our results suggest that by disrupting SV reallocation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es, sAβ<sub>1–42</sub> prevents neurons from forming new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es or adjusting strength and activity among neighboring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. Targeting this mechanism might prevent synaptic dysfunction in AD patients.</p>

Locally translated mTOR controls axonal local translation in nerve injury
<p>How is protein synthesis initiated locally in neurons? We found that mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) was activated and then up-regulated in injured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s, owing to local translation of mTOR messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA was transported into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s by the cell size–regulating RNA-binding protein nucleolin. Furthermore, mTOR controlled local translation in injured <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s. This included regulation of its own translation and that of retrograde injury signaling molecules such as importin β1 and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3). Deletion of the mTOR 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) in mice reduced mTOR in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s and decreased local translation after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e injury. Both pharmacological inhibition of mTOR in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s and deletion of the mTOR 3′UTR decreased proprioceptive neuronal survival after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e injury. Thus, mRNA localization enables spatiotemporal control of mTOR pathways regulating local translation and long-range intracellular signaling.</p>

Post-operative neuropathy after total hip arthroplasty
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy is a well-described complication   following total hip arthroplasty, but is highly distressing and   disabling. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy may cause difficulty with the post-operative   rehabilitation, and overall mobility of the patient. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy   may result from compression and tension to the affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e(s)   during the course of the operation via surgical manipulation and   retractor placement, tension from limb lengthening or compression   from post-operative hematoma. In the literature, hip dysplasia,   lengthening of the leg, the use of an uncemented femoral component, and   female gender are associated with a greater risk of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy.   We examined our experience at a high-volume, tertiary care referral   centre, and found an overall incidence of 0.3% out of 39 056 primary   hip arthroplasties. Risk factors found to be associated with the   incidence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy at our institution included the presence   of spinal stenosis or lumbar disc disease, age younger than 50,   and smoking. If a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e palsy is diagnosed, imaging is mandatory   and surgical evacuation or compressive haematomas may be beneficial.

Pin1 mediates Aβ<sub>42</sub>-induced dendritic spine loss
<p>Early-stage Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spines in the neocortex of the brain. This phenomenon precedes tau pathology, plaque formation, and neurodegeneration and likely contributes to synaptic loss, memory impairment, and behavioral changes in patients. Studies suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spine loss is induced by soluble, multimeric amyloid-β (Aβ<sub>42</sub>), which, through postsynaptic signaling, activates the protein phosphatase calcineurin. We investigated how calcineurin caused spine pathology and found that the cis-trans prolyl isomerase Pin1 was a critical downstream target of Aβ<sub>42</sub>-calcineurin signaling. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spines, Pin1 interacted with and was dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which rapidly suppressed its isomerase activity. Knockout of Pin1 or exposure to Aβ<sub>42</sub> induced the loss of mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spines, which was prevented by exogenous Pin1. The calcineurin inhibitor FK506 blocked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spine loss in Aβ<sub>42</sub>-treated wild-type cells but had no effect on <i>Pin1</i>-null neurons. These data implicate Pin1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spine maintenance and synaptic loss in early Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

Astrocyte-derived interleukin-33 promotes microglial synapse engulfment and neural circuit development
<p>Neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and remodeling are essential to central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system (CNS) development and are dysfunctional in neurodevelopmental diseases. Innate immune signals regulate tissue remodeling in the periphery, but how this affects CNS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es is largely unknown. Here, we show that the interleukin-1 family cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) is produced by developing astrocytes and is developmentally required for normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e numbers and neural circuit function in the spinal cord and thalamus. We find that IL-33 signals primarily to microglia under physiologic conditions, that it promotes microglial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e engulfment, and that it can drive microglial-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e depletion in vivo. These data reveal a cytokine-mediated mechanism required to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e homeostasis during CNS development.</p>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong> sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that spirally coat condensed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>ated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es (“white matter”). With such extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>ated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural circuits are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural circuits? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

Heterochronic Genes Turn Back the Clock in Old Neurons
<p>Although some neuron types regenerate better than others, all neurons lose the ability to regenerate with age. This intrinsic decline is the primary cause of regeneration failure even in permissive environments. This was shown in 1995 by comparing the regeneration ability of retinal neurons from different aged retinas growing into tectums of different ages (<i>1</i>). Embryonic retinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s regrew into tectum of any age, including older tectum with an inhibitory glial environment, whereas postnatal day 2 or older retinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s failed to regrow even into embryonic tectum. This indicated a “programmed” loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> regeneration ability with neuron age. Similarly, young hindbrain neurons transplanted into older spinal cords could regenerate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s into a normally inhibitory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>ated environment (<i>2</i>). Despite the clear therapeutic implications of these observations, the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling age-dependent regenerative capacity were unclear. On page 372 in this issue, Zou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report that the highly conserved <i>let-7</i>–LIN-41 heterochronic signaling pathway is responsible for part of the age-related decline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> regeneration in the worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>.</p>

The nociceptin receptor inhibits axonal regeneration and recovery from spinal cord injury
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al growth after traumatic spinal cord injury is limited by endogenous inhibitors, selective blockade of which promotes partial neurological recovery. The partial repair phenotypes suggest that compensatory pathways limit improvement. Gene expression profiles of mice deficient in <i>Ngr1</i>, which encodes a receptor for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">myelin</span></strong>-associated inhibitors of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al regeneration such as Nogo, revealed that trauma increased the mRNA expression of <i>ORL1</i>, which encodes the receptor for the opioid-related peptide nociceptin. Endogenous and overexpressed ORL1 coimmunoprecipitated with immature NgR1 protein, and ORL1 enhanced the O-linked glycosylation and surface expression of NgR1 in HEK293T and Neuro2A cells and primary neurons. ORL1 overexpression inhibited cortical neuron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> regeneration independently of NgR1. Furthermore, regeneration was inhibited by an ORL1 agonist and enhanced by the ORL1 antagonist J113397 through a ROCK-dependent mechanism. Mice treated with J113397 after dorsal hemisection of the mid-thoracic spinal cord recovered greater locomotor function and exhibited lumbar raphespinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> sprouting. These effects were further enhanced by combined <i>Ngr1</i> deletion and ORL1 inhibition. Thus, ORL1 limits neural repair directly and indirectly by enhancing NgR1 maturation, and ORL1 antagonists enhance recovery from traumatic CNS injuries in wild-type and <i>Ngr1</i> null mice.</p>

Architects of neuronal wiring
<p>Nervous system function relies on precise connectivity of a multitude of distinct neuronal cell types. Each class of neuron exhibits a characteristic morphology where synaptic connections are patterned across the cell surface. Thus, individual types of neurons establish <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es on specific domains of target neurons, such as the cell body (soma) or a distal branch (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>e).

This compartmentalized organization of synaptic connections affects the integration of synaptic inputs and increases the computational power of neural circuits (<i>1</i>). Studies by Urwyler <i>et al.</i> on page 454 of this issue (<i>2</i>) and by Favuzzi <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) report in a fruit fly and mouse model, respectively, mechanisms of how spatial distribution of synaptic connections is achieved.</p>

Our artificial afferent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e collects pressure information (1 to 80 kilopascals) from clusters of pressure sensors, converts the pressure information into action potentials (0 to 100 hertz) by using ring oscillators, and integrates the action potentials from multiple ring oscillators with a synaptic transistor. Biomimetic hierarchical structures can detect movement of an object, combine simultaneous pressure inputs, and distinguish braille characters. Furthermore, we connected our artificial afferent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e to motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es to construct a hybrid bioelectronic reflex arc to actuate muscles. Our system has potential applications in neurorobotics and neuroprosthetics.</p>

Self-heating–induced healing of lithium dendrites
<p>Lithium (Li) metal electrodes are not deployable in rechargeable batteries because electrochemical plating and stripping invariably leads to growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>es that reduce coulombic efficiency and eventually short the battery. It is generally accepted that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>e problem is exacerbated at high current densities. Here, we report a regime for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>e evolution in which the reverse is true. In our experiments, we found that when the plating and stripping current density is raised above ~9 milliamperes per square centimeter, there is substantial self-heating of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>es, which triggers extensive surface migration of Li. This surface diffusion heals the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>es and smoothens the Li metal surface. We show that repeated doses of high-current-density healing treatment enables the safe cycling of Li-sulfur batteries with high coulombic efficiency.</p>

Nerves switch on angiogenic metabolism
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es release neurotransmitters to regulate most physiologic functions in the body. Recently, it has been recognized that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es play dominant roles in organogenesis and tissue regeneration (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>).

Dynamics of cortical dendritic membrane potential and spikes in freely behaving rats
<p>Neural activity in vivo is primarily measured using extracellular somatic spikes, which provide limited information about neural computation. Hence, it is necessary to record from neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>es, which can generate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic action potentials (DAPs) in vitro, which can profoundly influence neural computation and plasticity.

DAP firing rates were several-fold larger than somatic rates. DAP rates were also modulated by subthreshold DMP fluctuations, which were far larger than DAP amplitude, indicating hybrid, analog-digital coding in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>es. Parietal DAP and DMP exhibited egocentric spatial maps comparable to pyramidal neurons. These results have important implications for neural coding and plasticity.</p>

Ultrastructural evidence for synaptic scaling across the wake/sleep cycle
<p>It is assumed that synaptic strengthening and weakening balance throughout learning to avoid runaway potentiation and memory interference. However, energetic and informational considerations suggest that potentiation should occur primarily during wake, when animals learn, and depression should occur during sleep. We measured 6920 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es in mouse motor and sensory cortices using three-dimensional electron microscopy. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>-spine interface (ASI) decreased ~18% after sleep compared with wake. This decrease was proportional to ASI size, which is indicative of scaling. Scaling was selective, sparing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es that were large and lacked recycling endosomes. Similar scaling occurred for spine head volume, suggesting a distinction between weaker, more plastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es (~80%) and stronger, more stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. These results support the hypothesis that a core function of sleep is to renormalize overall synaptic strength increased by wake.</p>

Neuronal activity drives FMRP- and HSPG-dependent matrix metalloproteinase function required for rapid synaptogenesis
<p>Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) functions modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e formation and activity-dependent plasticity. Aberrant MMP activity is implicated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), a disease caused by the loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP and characterized by neurological dysfunction and intellectual disability. Gene expression studies in <i>Drosophila</i> suggest that Mmps cooperate with the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) glypican co-receptor Dally-like protein (Dlp) to restrict trans-synaptic Wnt signaling and that synaptogenic defects in the fly model of FXS are alleviated by either inhibition of Mmp or genetic reduction of Dlp. We used the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) glutamatergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e to test activity-dependent Dlp and Mmp intersections in the context of FXS. We found that rapid, activity-dependent synaptic bouton formation depended on secreted Mmp1. Acute neuronal stimulation reduced the abundance of Mmp2 but increased that of both Mmp1 and Dlp, as well as enhanced the colocalization of Dlp and Mmp1 at the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e. Dlp function promoted Mmp1 abundance, localization, and proteolytic activity around <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es. Dlp glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains mediated this functional interaction with Mmp1. In the FXS fly model, activity-dependent increases in Mmp1 abundance and activity were lost but were restored by reducing the amount of synaptic Dlp. The data suggest that neuronal activity-induced, HSPG-dependent Mmp regulation drives activity-dependent synaptogenesis and that this is impaired in FXS. Thus, exploring this mechanism further may reveal therapeutic targets that have the potential to restore synaptogenesis in FXS patients.</p>

Aberrant Rac1-cofilin signaling mediates defects in dendritic spines, synaptic function, and sensory perception in fragile X syndrome
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disabilities and a leading cause of autism. FXS is caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the gene <i>FMR1</i> on the X chromosome. The neuroanatomical hallmark of FXS is an overabundance of immature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spines, a factor thought to underlie synaptic dysfunction and impaired cognition. We showed that aberrantly increased activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 inhibited the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin, a major determinant of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spine structure, and caused disease-associated spine abnormalities in the somatosensory cortex of FXS model mice. Increased cofilin phosphorylation and actin polymerization coincided with abnormal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spines and impaired synaptic maturation. Viral delivery of a constitutively active cofilin mutant (cofilinS3A) into the somatosensory cortex of <i>Fmr1</i>-deficient mice rescued the immature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic spine phenotype and increased spine density. Inhibition of the Rac1 effector PAK1 with a small-molecule inhibitor rescued cofilin signaling in FXS mice, indicating a causal relationship between PAK1 and cofilin signaling. PAK1 inhibition rescued synaptic signaling (specifically the synaptic ratio of NMDA/AMPA in layer V pyramidal neurons) and improved sensory processing in FXS mice. These findings suggest a causal relationship between increased Rac1-cofilin signaling, synaptic defects, and impaired sensory processing in FXS and uncover a previously unappreciated role for impaired Rac1-cofilin signaling in the aberrant spine morphology and spine density associated with FXS.</p>

Exploring cytoskeletal diversity in neurons
<p>Often in biology, form follows function. For example, the ability of neurons to receive, process, and transmit information depends on their polarized organization into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>es. The cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins shape cells and establish spatial organization. Microtubules (MTs) and actin are core components of the cytoskeleton and are assembled through head-to-tail polymerization of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers and actin monomers, respectively, resulting in asymmetric, polarized polymers with two different ends, called plus and minus ends. The spatially regulated polymerization of MTs and actin can drive morphological transitions, such as local protrusion of the plasma membrane, to drive cell migration or the development of specialized extensions, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>es and their branches. In addition, the structural asymmetry of MTs and actin enables cytoskeletal motor proteins (myosin, kinesin, and dynein) to walk toward a specific end of the fibers. Given the extreme dimensions and functional compartmentalization of neurons, such active transport is critical to sort and distribute cellular cargoes. Recent studies have used advanced microscopy to reveal how the cytoskeleton takes many different forms to facilitate local functions in neurons (see the figure).</p>

Defective cholesterol clearance limits remyelination in the aged central nervous system

Adrenergic nerves activate an angio-metabolic switch in prostate cancer

Recent work suggests that newly formed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e fib</span></strong>ers may regulate the tumor microenvironment, but their exact functions are unclear. Studying mouse models of prostate cancer, we show that endothelial β-adrenergic receptor signaling via adrenergic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e–derived noradrenaline in the prostate stroma is critical for activation of an angiogenic switch that fuels exponential tumor growth. Mechanistically, this occurs through alteration of endothelial cell metabolism. Endothelial cells typically rely on aerobic glycolysis for angiogenesis. We found that the loss of endothelial <i>Adrb2</i>, the gene encoding the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor, leads to inhibition of angiogenesis through enhancement of endothelial oxidative phosphorylation. Codeletion of <i>Adrb2</i> and <i>Cox10</i>, a gene encoding a cytochrome IV oxidase assembly factor, prevented the metabolic shift induced by <i>Adrb2</i> deletion and rescued prostate cancer progression. This cross-talk between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es and endothelial metabolism could potentially be targeted as an anticancer therapy.</p>

Pcdhαc2 is required for axonal tiling and assembly of serotonergic circuitries in mice

Genetic dissection and expression profiling revealed that this role is specifically mediated by Pcdhαc2, which is the only Pcdhα isoform expressed in serotonergic neurons. We conclude that, in contrast to neurite self-avoidance, which requires single-cell identity mediated by Pcdh diversity, a single cell-type identity mediated by the common C-type Pcdh isoform is required for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al tiling and assembly of serotonergic circuitries.</p>

Homer1a drives homeostatic scaling-down of excitatory synapses during sleep
<p>Sleep is an essential process that supports learning and memory by acting on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es through poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Using biochemistry, proteomics, and imaging in mice, we find that during sleep, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es undergo widespread alterations in composition and signaling, including weakening of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es through removal and dephosphorylation of synaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors.

Homer1a serves as a molecular integrator of arousal and sleep need via the wake- and sleep-promoting neuromodulators, noradrenaline and adenosine, respectively. Our data suggest that homeostatic scaling-down, a global form of synaptic plasticity, is active during sleep to remodel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es and participates in the consolidation of contextual memory.</p>

Building bridges to regenerate axons
<p>After traumatic spinal cord injury, local damage responses have an important effect on regenerating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s. In lower organisms (i.e., zebrafish and newt), glial cells and other non-neuronal cell types proliferate, migrate, and differentiate to form a bridge between the two ends of a transected spinal cord. This glial bridge supports <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> regeneration across the lesion site, enabling functional recovery. However, in mammals, a glial scar composed of mixed cell types and extracellular matrix forms to seal such a wound.

Dual role for Hox genes and Hox co-factors in conferring leg motoneuron survival and identity in <i>Drosophila</i>

Removing either Hox or Hth function from a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neuroblast</span></strong> (NB) lineage results in MN apoptosis. A single Hox gene, <i>Antennapedia</i> (<i>Antp</i>), is primarily responsible for MN survival in all three thoracic segments.

The tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 promotes T cell adhesion by activating the adaptor protein CrkII in the immunological synapse
<p>The adaptor protein CrkII regulates T cell adhesion by recruiting the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G, an activator of Rap1. Subsequently, Rap1 stimulates the integrin LFA-1, which leads to T cell adhesion and interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The adhesion of T cells to APCs is critical for their proper function and education. The interface between the T cell and the APC is known as the immunological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e. It is characterized by the specific organization of proteins that can be divided into central supramolecular activation clusters (c-SMACs) and peripheral SMACs (p-SMACs). Through total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and experiments with supported lipid bilayers, we determined that activated Rap1 was recruited to the immunological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e and localized to the p-SMAC. C3G and the active (dephosphorylated) form of CrkII also localized to the same compartment. In contrast, inactive (phosphorylated) CrkII was confined to the c-SMAC. Activation of CrkII and its subsequent movement from the c-SMAC to the p-SMAC depended on the phosphatase SHP-1, which acted downstream of the T cell receptor. In the p-SMAC, CrkII recruited C3G, which led to Rap1 activation and LFA-1–mediated adhesion of T cells to APCs. Functionally, SHP-1 was necessary for both the adhesion and migration of T cells. Together, these data highlight a signaling pathway in which SHP-1 acts through CrkII to reshape the pattern of Rap1 activation in the immunological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>e.</p>

The glycosylation pathway is required for the secretion of Slit and for the maintenance of the Slit receptor Robo on axons
<p>Slit proteins act as repulsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> guidance cues by activating receptors of the Roundabout (Robo) family. During early neurogenesis in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, Slit prevents the growth cones of longitudinal tract neurons from inappropriately crossing the midline, thus restricting these cells to trajectories parallel to the midline. Slit is expressed in midline glial cells, and Robo is present in longitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> tracts and growth cones. We showed that the enzyme Mummy (Mmy) controlled Slit-Robo signaling through mechanisms that affected both the ligand and the receptor. Mmy was required for the glycosylation of Slit, which was essential for Slit secretion. Mmy was also required for maintaining the abundance and spatial distribution of Robo through an indirect mechanism that was independent of Slit secretion. Moreover, secretion of Slit was required to maintain the fasciculation and position of longitudinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> tracts, thus maintaining the hardwiring of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system.

Distinct molecular programs regulate synapse specificity in cortical inhibitory circuits
<p>How neuronal connections are established and organized into functional networks determines brain function. In the mammalian cerebral cortex, different classes of GABAergic interneurons exhibit specific connectivity patterns that underlie their ability to shape temporal dynamics and information processing. Much progress has been made toward parsing interneuron diversity, yet the molecular mechanisms by which interneuron-specific connectivity motifs emerge remain unclear. In this study, we investigated transcriptional dynamics in different classes of interneurons during the formation of cortical inhibitory circuits in mouse. We found that whether interneurons form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>es, soma, or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> initial segment of pyramidal cells is determined by synaptic molecules that are expressed in a subtype-specific manner.

A gut feeling
<p>The anatomist Friedrich S. Merkel predicted in 1880 that sensory systems are composed of epithelial cells and sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es, which together transform environmental cues into neural signals that trigger our rich sensory experiences (<i>1</i>). We now know that this hypothesis mostly holds true for the canonical senses of vision, hearing, taste, and touch. Perhaps surprisingly, the peripheral outposts of these classical sensory systems (eyes, ears, tongue, and skin) are dwarfed by the human body's largest sensory organ—the gut. Enteroendocrine cells, which are rare epithelial cells that decorate the gut lining, have long been suspected to be sensory receptor cells that inform the brain about ingested nutrients (<i>2</i>). Since their description, these cells were assumed to play a role in metabolism and gut physiology by releasing slow-acting peptide hormones that stimulate neurons throughout the gut and in the brain. On page 1219 of this issue, Kaelberer <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) challenge this view by demonstrating that gut enteroendocrine cells locally excite sensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es through release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. A recent study of enterochromaffin cells, a subset of enteroendocrine cells, also found that gut signals are transmitted at epithelial-neural <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es through release of the neurotransmitter serotonin (<i>4</i>). Together, these findings overturn a decades-old dogma that enteroendocrine cells signal exclusively through hormones.</p>

Locally coordinated synaptic plasticity of visual cortex neurons in vivo
<p>Plasticity of cortical responses in vivo involves activity-dependent changes at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es, but the manner in which different forms of synaptic plasticity act together to create functional changes in neurons remains unknown. We found that spike timing–induced receptive field plasticity of visual cortex neurons in mice is anchored by increases in the synaptic strength of identified spines. This is accompanied by a decrease in the strength of adjacent spines on a slower time scale. The locally coordinated potentiation and depression of spines involves prominent AMPA receptor redistribution via targeted expression of the immediate early gene product Arc. Hebbian strengthening of activated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es and heterosynaptic weakening of adjacent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">synaps</span></strong>es thus cooperatively orchestrate cell-wide plasticity of functional neuronal responses.</p>

Topological and modality-specific representation of somatosensory information in the fly brain
<p>Insects and mammals share similarities of neural organization underlying the perception of odors, taste, vision, sound, and gravity. We observed that insect somatosensation also corresponds to that of mammals. In <i>Drosophila</i>, the projections of all the somatosensory neuron types to the insect’s equivalent of the spinal cord segregated into modality-specific layers comparable to those in mammals. Some sensory neurons in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ate the ventral brain directly to form modality-specific and topological somatosensory maps. Ascending interneurons with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>es in matching layers of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e cord send <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s that converge to respective brain regions. Pathways arising from leg somatosensory neurons encode distinct qualities of leg movement information and play different roles in ground detection. Establishment of the ground pattern and genetic tools for neuronal manipulation should provide the basis for elucidating the mechanisms underlying somatosensation.</p>

Multipotent peripheral glial cells generate neuroendocrine cells of the adrenal medulla
<p>Adrenaline is a fundamental circulating hormone for bodily responses to internal and external stressors. Chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla (AM) represent the main neuroendocrine adrenergic component and are believed to differentiate from neural crest cells. We demonstrate that large numbers of chromaffin cells arise from peripheral glial stem cells, termed Schwann cell precursors (SCPs). SCPs migrate along the visceral motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e to the vicinity of the forming adrenal gland, where they detach from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e and form postsynaptic neuroendocrine chromaffin cells. An intricate molecular logic drives two sequential phases of gene expression, one unique for a distinct transient cellular state and another for cell type specification. Subsequently, these programs down-regulate SCP-gene and up-regulate chromaffin cell–gene networks. The AM forms through limited cell expansion and requires the recruitment of numerous SCPs. Thus, peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es serve as a stem cell niche for neuroendocrine system development.</p>

Multicluster Pcdh diversity is required for mouse olfactory neural circuit assembly
<p>The vertebrate clustered protocadherin (Pcdh) cell surface proteins are encoded by three closely linked gene clusters (<i>Pcdh</i>α, <i>Pcdh</i>β, and <i>Pcdh</i>γ). Here, we show that all three gene clusters functionally cooperate to provide individual mouse olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) with the cell surface diversity required for their assembly into distinct glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Although deletion of individual <i>Pcdh</i> clusters had subtle phenotypic consequences, the loss of all three clusters (tricluster deletion) led to a severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al arborization defect and loss of self-avoidance. By contrast, when endogenous Pcdh diversity is overridden by the expression of a single–tricluster gene repertoire (α and β and γ), OSN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s fail to converge to form glomeruli, likely owing to contact-mediated repulsion between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s expressing identical combinations of Pcdh isoforms.</p>

Layer-specific modulation of neocortical dendritic inhibition during active wakefulness
<p>γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inputs are strategically positioned to gate synaptic integration along the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic arbor of pyramidal cells. However, their spatiotemporal dynamics during behavior are poorly understood. Using an optical-tagging electrophysiological approach to record and label somatostatin-expressing (Sst) interneurons (GABAergic neurons specialized for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic inhibition), we discovered a layer-specific modulation of their activity in behaving mice. Sst interneuron subtypes, residing in different cortical layers and in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ating complementary laminar domains, exhibited opposite activity changes during transitions to active wakefulness. The relative weight of vasoactive intestinal peptide–expressing (Vip) interneuron–mediated inhibition of distinct Sst interneurons and cholinergic modulation determined their in vivo activity. These results reveal a state-dependent laminar influence of Sst interneuron–mediated inhibition, with implications for the compartmentalized regulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic signaling in the mammalian neocortex.</p>

Active cortical dendrites modulate perception
<p>There is as yet no consensus concerning the neural basis of perception and how it operates at a mechanistic level. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in the apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>es of a subset of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in mice is correlated with the threshold for perceptual detection of whisker deflections. Manipulating the activity of apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>es shifted the perceptual threshold, demonstrating that an active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dendrit</span></strong>ic mechanism is causally linked to perceptual detection.</p>

The sacral autonomic outflow is sympathetic
<p>A kinship between cranial and pelvic visceral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es of vertebrates has been accepted for a century. Accordingly, sacral preganglionic neurons are considered parasympathetic, as are their targets in the pelvic ganglia that prominently control rectal, bladder, and genital functions. Here, we uncover 15 phenotypic and ontogenetic features that distinguish pre- and postganglionic neurons of the cranial parasympathetic outflow from those of the thoracolumbar sympathetic outflow in mice. By every single one, the sacral outflow is indistinguishable from the thoracolumbar outflow. Thus, the parasympathetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system receives input from cranial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es exclusively and the sympathetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system from spinal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>es, thoracic to sacral inclusively. This simplified, bipartite architecture offers a new framework to understand pelvic neurophysiology as well as development and evolution of the autonomic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system, predominantly the peripheral system (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central system with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous systems. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e dysfunction, as indicated by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>e conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous systems, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Loss of the E3 ubiquitin ligase LRSAM1 sensitizes peripheral axons to degeneration in a mouse model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
<p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> degeneration with subsequent motor and sensory deficits. Several CMT gene products function in endosomal sorting and trafficking to the lysosome, suggesting that defects in this cellular pathway might present a common pathogenic mechanism for these conditions. LRSAM1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is implicated in this process, and mutations in <i>LRSAM1</i> have recently been shown to cause CMT. We have generated mouse mutations in <i>Lrsam1</i> to create an animal model of this form of CMT (CMT2P). Mouse <i>Lrsam1</i> is abundantly expressed in the motor and sensory neurons of the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nerv</span></strong>ous system. Both homozygous and heterozygous mice have largely normal neuromuscular performance and only a very mild neuropathy phenotype with age. However, <i>Lrsam1</i> mutant mice are more sensitive to challenge with acrylamide, a neurotoxic agent that causes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong> degeneration, indicating that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s in the mutant mice are indeed compromised. In transfected cells, LRSAM1 primarily localizes in a perinuclear compartment immediately beyond the Golgi and shows little colocalization with components of the endosome to lysosome trafficking pathway, suggesting that other cellular mechanisms also merit consideration.</p>

Rapid binge-like eating and body weight gain driven by zona incerta GABA neuron activation
<p>The neuronal substrate for binge eating, which can at times lead to obesity, is not clear. We find that optogenetic stimulation of mouse zona incerta (ZI) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons or their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al projections to paraventricular thalamus (PVT) excitatory neurons immediately (in 2 to 3 seconds) evoked binge-like eating. Minimal intermittent stimulation led to body weight gain; ZI GABA neuron ablation reduced weight. ZI stimulation generated 35% of normal 24-hour food intake in just 10 minutes. The ZI cells were excited by food deprivation and the gut hunger signal ghrelin. In contrast, stimulation of excitatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>s from the parasubthalamic nucleus to PVT or direct stimulation of PVT glutamate neurons reduced food intake. These data suggest an unexpected robust orexigenic potential for the ZI GABA neurons.</p>

Three-dimensional Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging advances understanding of astrocyte biology
<p>Astrocyte communication is typically studied by two-dimensional calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) imaging, but this method has not yielded conclusive data on the role of astrocytes in synaptic and vascular function. We developed a three-dimensional two-photon imaging approach and studied Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in entire astrocyte volumes, including during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>-astrocyte interactions. In both awake mice and brain slices, we found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in an individual astrocyte is scattered throughout the cell, largely compartmented between regions, preponderantly local within regions, and heterogeneously distributed regionally and locally. Processes and endfeet displayed frequent fast activity, whereas the soma was infrequently active. In awake mice, activity was higher than in brain slices, particularly in endfeet and processes, and displayed occasional multifocal cellwide events. Astrocytes responded locally to minimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">axon</span></strong>al firing with time-correlated Ca<sup>2+</sup> spots.</p>

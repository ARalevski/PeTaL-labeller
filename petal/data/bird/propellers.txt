Long non-coding RNAs regulate Wnt signaling during feather regeneration
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Analysis of the role of lncRNAs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feather</span></strong> regeneration reveal that lncRNAs can modulate Wnt signaling and regulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feather</span></strong> regeneration, suggesting that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feather</span></strong> follicles can be used to functionally annotate chicken genome lncRNAs.</p>

Magnificent magpie colours by feathers with layers of hollow melanosomes
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Stacks of rodlet-shaped melanosomes with an air core acting as dielectric multilayers create the striking bright blue or purple-to-green colours of magpie <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feather</span></strong>s. The spectral properties of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feather</span></strong>s can be quantitatively explained with optical models based on anatomical data.</p>

Low–interfacial toughness materials for effective large-scale deicing
<p>Ice accretion has adverse effects on a range of commercial and residential activities. The force required to remove ice from a surface is typically considered to scale with the iced area. This imparts a scalability limit to the use of icephobic coatings for structures with large surface areas, such as power lines or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ship</span></strong> hulls. We describe a class of materials that exhibit a low interfacial toughness with ice, resulting in systems for which the forces required to remove large areas of ice (a few square centimeters or greater) are both low and independent of the iced area. We further demonstrate that coatings made of such materials allow ice to be shed readily from large areas (~1 square meter) merely by self-weight.</p>

Use of cholera vaccines expands, raising hopes
<p>This could be a pivotal year in the fight against cholera, public health experts say. The disease has taken a large toll in the last months: In war-torn Yemen the number of cases reached more than a million; outbreaks ravaged South Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia, and other African countries; and Haiti continues to suffer from the disease. But an emergency vaccine stockpile established in 2013 has grown rapidly and a new, easier-to-use formulation has hit the market, making large-scale campaigns feasible. Soon, 2.4 million doses are to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ship</span></strong>ped to Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where another epidemic looms. With interventions like this, experts hope to make a dent in the global burden of cholera, estimated at 3 million cases a year. And Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which is funding the stockpile, is set to decide later this year whether it will start funding routine immunizations in endemic areas as well.</p>

Emergent cellular self-organization and mechanosensation initiate follicle pattern in the avian skin
<p>The spacing of hair in mammals and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feather</span></strong>s in birds is one of the most apparent morphological features of the skin. This pattern arises when uniform fields of progenitor cells diversify their molecular fate while adopting higher-order structure. Using the nascent skin of the developing chicken embryo as a model system, we find that morphological and molecular symmetries are simultaneously broken by an emergent process of cellular self-organization. The key initiators of heterogeneity are dermal progenitors, which spontaneously aggregate through contractility-driven cellular pulling. Concurrently, this dermal cell aggregation triggers the mechanosensitive activation of β-catenin in adjacent epidermal cells, initiating the follicle gene expression program. Taken together, this mechanism provides a means of integrating mechanical and molecular perspectives of organ formation.</p>

The mechanics of positioning skin follicles
<p>The hair that covers our body is placed in an ordered manner. What determines where exactly a hair grows from our skin? On page 811 of this issue, Shyer and colleagues (<i>1</i>) reveal the mechanism by which skin follicles, the specific structures that produce hairs in mammals and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">feather</span></strong>s in birds, obtain a regular pattern in their distribution across the skin.</p>

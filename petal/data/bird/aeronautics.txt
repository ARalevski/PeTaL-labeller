The effects of age and lifetime flight behavior on flight capacity in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>
<p>The effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> behavior on physiology and senescence may be profound in insects because of the extremely high metabolic costs of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> capacity in insects decreases with age; in contrast, limiting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> behavior extends lifespan and slows the age-related loss of antioxidant capacity and accumulation of oxidative damage in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> muscles. In this study, we tested the effects of age and lifetime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> behavior on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> capacity by measuring wingbeat frequency, the ability to fly in a hypo-dense gas mixture, and metabolic rate in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Specifically, 5-day-old adult flies were separated into three life-long treatments: (1) those not allowed to fly (no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>), (2) those allowed – but not forced – to fly (voluntary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>) and (3) those mechanically stimulated to fly (induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> capacity senesced earliest in flies from the no-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> treatment, followed by the induced-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> group and then the voluntary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> group. Wingbeat frequency senesced with age in all treatment groups, but was most apparent in the voluntary- and induced-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> groups. Metabolic rate during agitated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> senesced earliest and most rapidly in the induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> group, and was low and uniform throughout age in the no-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> group. Early senescence in the induced-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> group was likely due to the acceleration of deleterious aging phenomena such as the rapid accumulation of damage at the cellular level, while the early loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> capacity and low metabolic rates in the no-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> group demonstrate that disuse effects can also significantly alter senescence patterns of whole-insect performance.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> control, where animals deal with potential instability and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> control structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate lift and drag forces. However, other actuators that may impact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> performance are reflexively activated during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> control. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response characteristics (measured as a transfer function) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The transfer function reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average lift force provided by the wings. We show that control of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim stability margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect lift forces for effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> control. Furthermore, the small stability margin may increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> agility by easing the transition from stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Disparities in science literacy
<p>Much is known about how adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy varies internationally and over time, and about its association with attitudes and beliefs. However, less is known about disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy across racial and ethnic groups (<i>1</i>). This is particularly surprising in light of substantial research on racial and ethnic disparities in related areas such as educational achievement, math and reading ability (<i>2</i>), representation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) occupations (<i>3</i>), and health literacy (<i>4</i>). Given the importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy to securing and sustaining many jobs, to understanding key health concepts to enhance quality of life, and to increasing public engagement in societal decision-making (<i>5</i>), it is concerning if the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy is unequally stratified, particularly if this stratification reflects broader patterns of disadvantage and cultural dominance as experienced by minorities and educationally underserved populations. We describe here such disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy in the United States and attempt to explain underlying drivers, concluding that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy disadvantage among black and Hispanic adults relative to whites is only partially explained by measures of broader, foundational literacies and socioeconomic status (SES).</p>

A tailless aerial robotic flapper reveals that flies use torque coupling in rapid banked turns
<p>Insects are among the most agile natural flyers. Hypotheses on their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> control cannot always be validated by experiments with animals or tethered robots. To this end, we developed a programmable and agile autonomous free-flying robot controlled through bio-inspired motion changes of its flapping wings. Despite being 55 times the size of a fruit fly, the robot can accurately mimic the rapid escape maneuvers of flies, including a correcting yaw rotation toward the escape heading. Because the robot’s yaw control was turned off, we showed that these yaw rotations result from passive, translation-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerodynam</span></strong>ic coupling between the yaw torque and the roll and pitch torques produced throughout the maneuver. The robot enables new methods for studying animal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>, and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> characteristics allow for real-world <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> missions.</p>

Tree Physiology
Revisiting the sequencing of the first tree genome: <i>Populus trichocarpa</i>
<p>Ten years ago, it was announced that the Joint Genome Institute with funds provided by the Department of Energy, Office of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e, Biological and Environmental Research would sequence the black cottonwood (<i>Populus trichocarpa</i> Torr. & Gray) genome. This landmark decision was the culmination of work by the forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e community to develop <i>Populus</i> as a model system. Since its public release in late 2006, the availability of the <i>Populus</i> genome has spawned research in plant biology, morphology, genetics and ecology. Here we address how the tree physiologist has used this resource. More specifically, we revisit our earlier contention that the rewards of sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome would depend on how quickly scientists working with woody perennials could adopt molecular approaches to investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of basic physiological processes. Several examples illustrate the integration of functional and comparative genomics into the forest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>es, especially in areas that target improved understanding of the developmental differences between woody perennials and herbaceous annuals (e.g., phase transitions). Sequencing the <i>Populus</i> genome and the availability of genetic and genomic resources has also been instrumental in identifying candidate genes that underlie physiological and morphological traits of interest. Genome-enabled research has advanced our understanding of how phenotype and genotype are related and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms whereby woody perennials adapt to environmental stress. In the future, we anticipate that low-cost, high-throughput sequencing will continue to facilitate research in tree physiology and enhance our understanding at scales of individual organisms and populations. A challenge remains, however, as to how genomic resources, including the <i>Populus</i> genome, can be used to understand ecosystem function. Although examples are limited, progress in this area is encouraging and will undoubtedly improve as future research targets the many unique aspects of <i>Populus</i> as a keystone species in terrestrial ecosystems.</p>

Hawkmoths use nectar sugar to reduce oxidative damage from flight
<p>Nectar-feeding animals have among the highest recorded metabolic rates. High aerobic performance is linked to oxidative damage in muscles. Antioxidants in nectar are scarce to nonexistent. We propose that nectarivores use nectar sugar to mitigate the oxidative damage caused by the muscular demands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>. We found that sugar-fed moths had lower oxidative damage to their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> muscle membranes than unfed moths. Using respirometry coupled with δ<sup>13</sup>C analyses, we showed that moths generate antioxidant potential by shunting nectar glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), resulting in a reduction in oxidative damage to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> muscles. We suggest that nectar feeding, the use of PPP, and intense exercise are causally linked and have allowed the evolution of powerful fliers that feed on nectar.</p>

Convergence Between Science and Environmental Education

To address them, environmental educators and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e educators seek to engage people in what are commonly referred to as sustainability challenges. Regrettably, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e education (SE), which focuses primarily on teaching knowledge and skills, and environmental education (EE), which also stresses the incorporation of values and changing behaviors, have become increasingly distant. The relationship between SE and EE has been characterized as “distant, competitive, predatorprey and host-parasite” (<i>2</i>). We examine the potential for a convergence of EE and SE that might engage people in addressing fundamental socioecological challenges.</p>

Particulate Matter Exposure and Stress Hormone Levels
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) is associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, but potential mechanisms are largely unknown. Metabolomics represents a powerful approach to study global metabolic changes in response to environmental exposures. We therefore conducted this study to investigate changes in serum metabolites in response to the reduction of PM exposure among healthy college students.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a randomized, double-blind crossover trial in 55 healthy college students in Shanghai, China. Real and sham air purifiers were placed in participants’ dormitories in random order for 9 days with a 12-day washout period. Serum metabolites were quantified by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Between-treatment differences in metabolites were examined using orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis and mixed-effect models. Secondary outcomes include blood pressure, corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, insulin resistance, and biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average personal exposure to PMs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerodynam</span></strong>ic diameters ≤2.5 μm was 24.3 μg/m<sup>3</sup> during the real purification and 53.1 μg/m<sup>3</sup> during the sham purification. Metabolomics analysis showed that higher exposure to PMs with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">aerodynam</span></strong>ic diameters ≤2.5 μm led to significant increases in cortisol, cortisone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Between-treatment differences were also observed for glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, and lipids.

Anatomy of STEM teaching in North American universities

Many educational and governmental bodies have called for and supported adoption of these student-centered strategies throughout the undergraduate STEM curriculum. But to the extent that we have pictures of the STEM undergraduate instructional landscape, it has mostly been provided through self-report surveys of faculty members, within a particular STEM discipline [e.g., (<i>3</i>–<i>6</i>)]. Such surveys are prone to reliability threats and can underestimate the complexity of classroom environments, and few are implemented nationally to provide valid and reliable data (<i>7</i>). Reflecting the limited state of these data, a report from the U.S. National Academies of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>es, Engineering, and Medicine called for improved data collection to understand the use of evidence-based instructional practices (<i>8</i>).

Ultrafast optical ranging using microresonator soliton frequency combs
<p>Light detection and ranging is widely used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e and industry. Over the past decade, optical frequency combs were shown to offer advantages in optical ranging, enabling fast distance acquisition with high accuracy. Driven by emerging high-volume applications such as industrial sensing, drone navigation, or autonomous driving, there is now a growing demand for compact ranging systems. Here, we show that soliton Kerr comb generation in integrated silicon nitride microresonators provides a route to high-performance chip-scale ranging systems. We demonstrate dual-comb distance measurements with Allan deviations down to 12 nanometers at averaging times of 13 microseconds along with ultrafast ranging at acquisition rates of 100 megahertz, allowing for in-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> sampling of gun projectiles moving at 150 meters per second. Combining integrated soliton-comb ranging systems with chip-scale nanophotonic phased arrays could enable compact ultrafast ranging systems for emerging mass applications.</p>

Avian egg shape: Form, function, and evolution
<p>Avian egg shape is generally explained as an adaptation to life history, yet we currently lack a global synthesis of how egg-shape differences arise and evolve. Here, we apply morphometric, mechanistic, and macroevolutionary analyses to the egg shapes of 1400 bird species. We characterize egg-shape diversity in terms of two biologically relevant variables, asymmetry and ellipticity, allowing us to quantify the observed morphologies in a two-dimensional morphospace. We then propose a simple mechanical model that explains the observed egg-shape diversity based on geometric and material properties of the egg membrane. Finally, using phylogenetic models, we show that egg shape correlates with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> ability on broad taxonomic scales, suggesting that adaptations for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> may have been critical drivers of egg-shape variation in birds.</p>

Octopaminergic modulation of the visual flight speed regulator of <i>Drosophila</i>
<p>Recent evidence suggests that flies' sensitivity to large-field optic flow is increased by the release of octopamine during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong>. This increase in gain presumably enhances visually mediated behaviors such as the active regulation of forward speed, a process that involves the comparison of a vision-based estimate of velocity with an internal set point. To determine where in the neural circuit this comparison is made, we selectively silenced the octopamine neurons in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i>, and examined the effect on vision-based velocity regulation in free-flying flies. We found that flies with inactivated octopamine neurons accelerated more slowly in response to visual motion than control flies, but maintained nearly the same baseline <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">flight</span></strong> speed. Our results are parsimonious with a circuit architecture in which the internal control signal is injected into the visual motion pathway upstream of the interneuron network that estimates groundspeed.</p>

Renal acid excretion contributes to acid–base regulation during hypercapnia in air-exposed swamp eel (<i>Monopterus albus</i>)
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> The swamp eel – an obligate air-breathing fish from South East Asia – can completely restore extracellular pH within days of exposure to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hypercapnia</span></strong> and the kidneys play an important role in this response.</p>

The long road to steady state in gas exchange: metabolic and ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia in Cuvier's dwarf caiman
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Attainment of a steady state in gas exchange upon and following hypoxia and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hypercapnia</span></strong> in reptiles may take a prolonged time, especially if blood flow and ventilation rates are low.</p>

A Mutation in the bHLH Domain of the SPCH Transcription Factor Uncovers a BR-Dependent Mechanism for Stomatal Development<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The asymmetric cell divisions necessary for stomatal lineage initiation and progression in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) require the function of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor <i>SPEECHLESS</i> (<i>SPCH</i>). Mutants lacking <i>SPCH</i> do not produce stomata or lineages. Here, we isolated a new <i>spch-5</i> allele carrying a point mutation in the bHLH domain that displayed normal growth, but had an extremely low number of sometimes clustered stomata in the leaves, whereas the hypocotyls did not have any stomata. In vivo tracking of leaf epidermal cell divisions, combined with marker lines and genetic analysis, showed that the <i>spch-5</i> leaf phenotype is dosage dependent and results from the decreased ability to initiate and amplify lineages, defects in asymmetric cell fate allocation, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">misorient</span></strong>ation of asymmetric division planes. Notably, application of brassinosteroids (BRs) partly rescued the stomatal leaf phenotype of <i>spch-5</i>. Transcriptomic analysis combining <i>spch-5</i> with BR treatments revealed that the expression of a set of SPCH target genes was restored by BRs. Our results also show that BR-dependent stomata formation and expression of some, but not all, SPCH target genes require the integrity of the bHLH domain of SPCH.</p>

The effects of extended crawling on the physiology and swim performance of loggerhead and green sea turtle hatchlings
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Crawling long distances as a result of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disorient</span></strong>ation during the sea turtle hatchling frenzy has little impact on physiology but the turtles rest frequently, thus significantly extending their time on the beach.</p>

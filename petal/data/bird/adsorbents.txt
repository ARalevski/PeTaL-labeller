Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular plants. Resurrection plants have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation-tolerant species are dispersed across the land plant phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection plant lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection plant genomes and no expansion in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection plants convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation in all surveyed resurrection plants and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection plants. Together, these observations support convergent evolution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation tolerance in land plants through tandem gene duplication.</p>

Archetypal Roles of an Abscisic Acid Receptor in Drought and Sugar Responses in Liverworts
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) controls seed dormancy and stomatal closure through binding to the intracellular receptor Pyrabactin resistance1 (Pyr1)/Pyr1-like/regulatory components of ABA receptors (PYR/PYL/RCAR) in angiosperms. Genes encoding PYR/PYL/RCAR are thought to have arisen in the ancestor of embryophytes, but the roles of the genes in nonvascular plants have not been determined. In the liverwort <i>Marchantia polymorpha</i>, ABA reduces growth and enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation tolerance through increasing accumulation of intracellular sugars and various transcripts such as those of <i>Late Embryogenesis Abundant</i> (<i>LEA</i>)-like genes. In this study, we analyzed a gene designated Mp<i>PYL1,</i> which is closely related to <i>PYR</i>/<i>PYL</i>/<i>RCAR</i> of angiosperms, in transgenic liverworts. Transgenic lines overexpressing Mp<i>PYL1</i>-<i>GFP</i> showed ABA-hypersensitive growth with enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation tolerance, whereas Mp<i>pyl1</i> generated by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing showed ABA-insensitive growth with reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation tolerance. Transcriptome analysis indicated that Mp<i>PYL1</i> is a major regulator of abiotic stress-associated genes, including all 35 ABA-induced <i>LEA</i>-like genes. Furthermore, these transgenic plants showed altered responses to extracellular Suc, suggesting that ABA and PYR/PYL/RCAR function in sugar responses. The results presented here reveal an important role of PYR/PYL/RCAR in the ABA response, which was likely acquired in the common ancestor of land plants. The results also indicate the archetypal role of ABA and its receptor in sugar response and accumulation processes for vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation tolerance in bryophytes.</p>

A general synthesis approach for supported bimetallic nanoparticles via surface inorganometallic chemistry
<p>The synthesis of ultrasmall supported bimetallic nanoparticles (between 1 and 3 nanometers in diameter) with well-defined stoichiometry and intimacy between constituent metals remains a substantial challenge. We synthesized 10 different supported bimetallic nanoparticles via surface inorganometallic chemistry by decomposing and reducing surface-adsorbed heterometallic double complex salts, which are readily obtained upon sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adsorpt</span></strong>ion of target cations and anions on a silica substrate. For example, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adsorpt</span></strong>ion of tetraamminepalladium(II) [Pd(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub><sup>2+</sup>] followed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adsorpt</span></strong>ion of tetrachloroplatinate [PtCl<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>] was used to form palladium-platinum (Pd-Pt) nanoparticles. These supported bimetallic nanoparticles show enhanced catalytic performance in acetylene selective hydrogenation, which clearly demonstrates a synergistic effect between constituent metals.</p>

Hydrolytically stable fluorinated metal-organic frameworks for energy-efficient dehydration
<p>Natural gas must be dehydrated before it can be transported and used, but conventional drying agents such as activated alumina or inorganic molecular sieves require an energy-intensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ant-regeneration step. We report a hydrolytically stable fluorinated metal-organic framework, AlFFIVE-1-Ni (KAUST-8), with a periodic array of open metal coordination sites and fluorine moieties within the contracted square-shaped one-dimensional channel. This material selectively removed water vapor from gas streams containing CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and higher hydrocarbons typical of natural gas, as well as selectively removed both H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> in N<sub>2</sub>-containing streams.

[C <sc>ii</sc>] 158-μm emission from the host galaxies of damped Lyman-alpha systems

Invasion and adaptation of a warm-adapted species to montane localities: effect of acclimation potential
<p><i>Drosophila ananassae</i> has successfully invaded the cold and dry montane localities of the Western Himalayas in recent years. The ability of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation- and cold-sensitive tropical species to evolve in response to seasonal changes in montane localities is largely unknown. Here, we investigated how this sensitive species adapt to seasonally varying environmental conditions that are lethal to its survival. We observed change in the frequency of dark and light morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i> in five mid-altitude localities during the last decade (2000–2010). We document invasion of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities and increase in frequency of the dark morph. The stress tolerance of morphs (dark and light) remained unaffected of developmental acclimation. However, adult acclimation has shown significant effects on tolerance to various environmental stresses in morphs and effect of this acclimation persist for long durations. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation and cold stress tolerance was increased after adult acclimation for respective stress in the dark morph; while tolerance of the light morph was not affected. Further, heat tolerance of the light morph was increased after adult heat acclimation with no influence on heat tolerance of the dark morph. Our results suggest a possible role of adult acclimation in successful invasion and adaptation of <i>D. ananassae</i> to montane localities. Future experiments should be carried out to determine whether the survival in adverse conditions of low <i>versus</i> high temperature and humidity during seasonal changes is assisted by different acclimation abilities of the two morphs of <i>D. ananassae</i>.</p>

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet
<p>Stellar heating causes atmospheres of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape. These extended atmospheres are difficult to observe because their main spectral signature—neutral hydrogen at ultraviolet wavelengths—is strongly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ed by interstellar medium. We report the detection of the near-infrared triplet of neutral helium in the transiting warm Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-11b by using ground-based, high-resolution observations. The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average absorption depth of 1.08 ± 0.05%. Interpreting absorption spectra with three-dimensional simulations of the planet’s upper atmosphere suggests that it extends beyond 5 planetary radii, with a large-scale height and a helium mass loss rate of ≲3 × 10<sup>5</sup> grams per second. A net blue-shift of the absorption might be explained by high-altitude winds flowing at 3 kilometers per second from day to night-side.</p>

Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites
<p>The separation of ethane from its corresponding ethylene is an important, challenging, and energy-intensive process in the chemical industry.

Neutron powder diffraction studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate the key role of Fe-peroxo sites for the recognition of ethane.

Lacteal junction zippering protects against diet-induced obesity
<p>Excess dietary lipid uptake causes obesity, a major global health problem. Enterocyte-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ed lipids are packaged into chylomicrons, which enter the bloodstream through intestinal lymphatic vessels called lacteals. Here, we show that preventing lacteal chylomicron uptake by inducible endothelial genetic deletion of <i>Neuropilin1</i> (<i>Nrp1</i>) and <i>Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1</i> (<i>Vegfr1</i>; also known as <i>Flt1</i>) renders mice resistant to diet-induced obesity. Absence of NRP1 and FLT1 receptors increased VEGF-A bioavailability and signaling through VEGFR2, inducing lacteal junction zippering and chylomicron malabsorption. Restoring permeable lacteal junctions by VEGFR2 and vascular endothelial (VE)–cadherin signaling inhibition rescued chylomicron transport in the mutant mice. Zippering of lacteal junctions by disassembly of cytoskeletal VE-cadherin anchors prevented chylomicron uptake in wild-type mice. These data suggest that lacteal junctions may be targets for preventing dietary fat uptake.</p>

Destabilizing mutations encode nongenetic variation that drives evolutionary innovation
<p>Evolutionary innovations are often achieved by repurposing existing genes to perform new functions; however, the mechanisms enabling the transition from old to new remain controversial. We identified mutations in bacteriophage λ’s host-recognition gene <i>J</i> that confer enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adsorpt</span></strong>ion to λ’s native receptor, LamB, and the ability to access a new receptor, OmpF. The mutations destabilize λ particles and cause conformational bistability of J, which yields progeny of multiple phenotypic forms, each proficient at different receptors. This work provides an example of how nongenetic protein variation can catalyze an evolutionary innovation. We propose that cases where a single genotype can manifest as multiple phenotypes may be more common than previously expected and offer a general mechanism for evolutionary innovation.</p>

Near-infrared deep brain stimulation via upconversion nanoparticle–mediated optogenetics
<p>Optogenetics has revolutionized the experimental interrogation of neural circuits and holds promise for the treatment of neurological disorders.

Here, we demonstrate that molecularly tailored UCNPs can serve as optogenetic actuators of transcranial NIR light to stimulate deep brain neurons. Transcranial NIR UCNP-mediated optogenetics evoked dopamine release from genetically tagged neurons in the ventral tegmental area, induced brain oscillations through activation of inhibitory neurons in the medial septum, silenced seizure by inhibition of hippocampal excitatory cells, and triggered memory recall. UCNP technology will enable less-invasive optical neuronal activity manipulation with the potential for remote therapy.</p>

Building superlattices from individual nanoparticles via template-confined DNA-mediated assembly
<p>DNA programmable assembly has been combined with top-down lithography to construct superlattices of discrete, reconfigurable nanoparticle architectures on a gold surface over large areas. Specifically, the assembly of individual colloidal plasmonic nanoparticles with different shapes and sizes is controlled by oligonucleotides containing “locked” nucleic acids and confined environments provided by polymer pores to yield oriented architectures that feature tunable arrangements and independently controllable distances at both nanometer- and micrometer-length scales. These structures, which would be difficult to construct by other common assembly methods, provide a platform to systematically study and control light-matter interactions in nanoparticle-based optical materials. The generality and potential of this approach are explored by identifying a broadband <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>er with a solvent polarity response that allows dynamic tuning of visible light absorption.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene

This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically separate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility. Control of such properties extends the boundaries for applicability of zeolites to challenging separations.</p>

We report the use of tyrosine-containing tripeptides as tunable precursors for polymeric pigments. In these structures, phenols are presented in a (supra-)molecular context dictated by the positions of the amino acids in the peptide sequence. Oxidative polymerization can be tuned in a sequence-dependent manner, resulting in peptide sequence–encoded properties such as UV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ance, morphology, coloration, and electrochemical properties over a considerable range.

Scalable-manufactured randomized glass-polymer hybrid metamaterial for daytime radiative cooling

Improving photosynthesis and crop productivity by accelerating recovery from photoprotection
<p>Crop leaves in full sunlight dissipate damaging excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ed light energy as heat. When sunlit leaves are shaded by clouds or other leaves, this protective dissipation continues for many minutes and reduces photosynthesis. Calculations have shown that this could cost field crops up to 20% of their potential yield. Here, we describe the bioengineering of an accelerated response to natural shading events in <i>Nicotiana</i> (tobacco), resulting in increased leaf carbon dioxide uptake and plant dry matter productivity by about 15% in fluctuating light. Because the photoprotective mechanism that has been altered is common to all flowering plants and crops, the findings provide proof of concept for a route to obtaining a sustainable increase in productivity for food crops and a much-needed yield jump.</p>

Super-dry reforming of methane intensifies CO<sub>2</sub> utilization via Le Chatelier’s principle
<p>Efficient CO<sub>2</sub> transformation from a waste product to a carbon source for chemicals and fuels will require reaction conditions that effect its reduction. We developed a “super-dry” CH<sub>4</sub> reforming reaction for enhanced CO production from CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. We used Ni/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a CH<sub>4</sub>-reforming catalyst, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a solid oxygen carrier, and CaO/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as a CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sorbent</span></strong>. The isothermal coupling of these three different processes resulted in higher CO production as compared with that of conventional dry reforming, by avoiding back reactions with water. The reduction of iron oxide was intensified through CH<sub>4</sub> conversion to syngas over Ni and CO<sub>2</sub> extraction and storage as CaCO<sub>3</sub>. CO<sub>2</sub> is then used for iron reoxidation and CO production, exploiting equilibrium shifts effected with inert gas sweeping (Le Chatelier’s principle). Super-dry reforming uses up to three CO<sub>2</sub> molecules per CH<sub>4</sub> and offers a high CO space-time yield of 7.5 millimole CO per second per kilogram of iron at 1023 kelvin.</p>

SULTR3s Function in Chloroplast Sulfate Uptake and Affect ABA Biosynthesis and the Stress Response
<p>Plants are major sulfur reducers in the global sulfur cycle. Sulfate, the major natural sulfur source in soil, is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ed by plant roots and transported into plastids, where it is reduced and assimilated into Cys for further metabolic processes. Despite its importance, how sulfate is transported into plastids is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated using single Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genetic mutants that each member of the sulfate transporter (SULTR) subfamily 3 was able to transport sulfate across the chloroplast envelope membrane. To resolve the function of SULTR3s, we constructed a <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant completely knocking out all five members of the subfamily. Here we report that all members of the <i>SULTR3</i> subfamily show chloroplast membrane localization. Sulfate uptake by chloroplasts of the quintuple mutant is reduced by more than 50% compared with the wild type. Consequently, Cys and abscisic acid (ABA) content are reduced to ∼67 and ∼20% of the wild-type level, respectively, and strong positive correlations are found among sulfate, Cys, and ABA content. The <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant shows obvious growth retardation with smaller rosettes and shorter roots. Seed germination of the <i>sultr3</i> quintuple mutant is hypersensitive to exogenous ABA and salt stress, but is rescued by sulfide supplementation. Furthermore, sulfate-induced stomatal closure is abolished in the quintuple mutant, strongly suggesting that chloroplast sulfate is required for stomatal closure. Our genetic analyses unequivocally demonstrate that sulfate transporter subfamily 3 is responsible for more than half of the chloroplast sulfate uptake and influences downstream sulfate assimilation and ABA biosynthesis.</p>

PGR5-Dependent Cyclic Electron Flow Protects Photosystem I under Fluctuating Light at Donor and Acceptor Sides
<p>In response to a sudden increase in light intensity, plants must cope with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ed excess photon energy to protect photosystems from photodamage. Under fluctuating light, PSI is severely photodamaged in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>proton gradient regulation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutant defective in the main pathway of PSI cyclic electron transport (CET). Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed regulatory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) reservation of electron sink capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH production ratio (acceptor-side regulation) and (2) down-regulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic control for slowing down the electron flow toward PSI (donor-side regulation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> backgrounds by introducing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hypersensitivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to luminal acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic control partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant background but restricted linear electron transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic control should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large electron sink and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic control. Thus, donor-side regulation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side regulation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side regulation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

Chloroplast Accumulation Response Enhances Leaf Photosynthesis and Plant Biomass Production
<p>Under high light intensity, chloroplasts avoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ing excess light by moving to anticlinal cell walls (avoidance response), but under low light intensity, chloroplasts accumulate along periclinal cell walls (accumulation response). In most plant species, these responses are induced by blue light and are mediated by the blue light photoreceptor, phototropin, which also regulates phototropism, leaf flattening, and stomatal opening. These phototropin-mediated responses could enhance photosynthesis and biomass production. Here, using various Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in chloroplast movement, we demonstrated that the accumulation response enhances leaf photosynthesis and plant biomass production. Conspicuously, <i>phototropin2</i> mutant plants specifically defective in the avoidance response but not in other phototropin-mediated responses displayed a constitutive accumulation response irrespective of light intensities, enhanced leaf photosynthesis, and increased plant biomass production. Therefore, our findings provide clear experimental evidence of the importance of the chloroplast accumulation response in leaf photosynthesis and biomass production.</p>

Dynamic Changes between Two LHCX-Related Energy Quenching Sites Control Diatom Photoacclimation
<p>Marine diatoms are prominent phytoplankton organisms that perform photosynthesis in extremely variable environments. Diatoms possess a strong ability to dissipate excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ed energy as heat via nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). This process relies on changes in carotenoid pigment composition (xanthophyll cycle) and on specific members of the light-harvesting complex family specialized in photoprotection (LHCXs), which potentially act as NPQ effectors. However, the link between light stress, NPQ, and the existence of different LHCX isoforms is not understood in these organisms. Using picosecond fluorescence analysis, we observed two types of NPQ in the pennate diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> that were dependent on light conditions. Short exposure of low-light-acclimated cells to high light triggers the onset of energy quenching close to the core of photosystem II, while prolonged light stress activates NPQ in the antenna. Biochemical analysis indicated a link between the changes in the NPQ site/mechanism and the induction of different LHCX isoforms, which accumulate either in the antenna complexes or in the core complex. By comparing the responses of wild-type cells and transgenic lines with a reduced expression of the major LHCX isoform, LHCX1, we conclude that core complex-associated NPQ is more effective in photoprotection than is the antenna complex. Overall, our data clarify the complex molecular scenario of light responses in diatoms and provide a rationale for the existence of a degenerate family of LHCX proteins in these algae.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms Preventing Senescence in Response to Prolonged Darkness in a Desiccation-Tolerant Plant
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation-tolerant plant <i>Haberlea rhodopensis</i> can withstand months of darkness without any visible senescence. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to prolonged (30 d) darkness and subsequent return to light. <i>H. rhodopensis</i> plants remained green and viable throughout the dark treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that darkness regulated several transcription factor (TF) genes. Stress- and autophagy-related TFs such as <i>ERF8</i>, <i>HSFA2b</i>, <i>RD26</i>, <i>TGA1</i>, and <i>WRKY33</i> were up-regulated, while chloroplast- and flowering-related TFs such as <i>ATH1</i>, <i>COL2</i>, <i>COL4</i>, <i>RL1</i>, and <i>PTAC7</i> were repressed. <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i>, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and promoter of senescence, also was down-regulated. In response to darkness, most of the photosynthesis- and photorespiratory-related genes were strongly down-regulated, while genes related to autophagy were up-regulated. This occurred concomitant with the induction of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK1) signaling pathway genes, which regulate responses to stress-induced starvation and autophagy. Most of the genes associated with chlorophyll catabolism, which are induced by darkness in dark-senescing species, were either unregulated (<i>PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE, PAO; RED CHLOROPHYLL CATABOLITE REDUCTASE, RCCR</i>) or repressed (<i>STAY GREEN-LIKE</i>, <i>PHEOPHYTINASE</i>, and <i>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</i>). Metabolite profiling revealed increases in the levels of many amino acids in darkness, suggesting increased protein degradation. In darkness, levels of the chloroplastic lipids digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol decreased, while those of storage triacylglycerols increased, suggesting degradation of chloroplast membrane lipids and their conversion to triacylglycerols for use as energy and carbon sources. Collectively, these data show a coordinated response to darkness, including repression of photosynthetic, photorespiratory, flowering, and chlorophyll catabolic genes, induction of autophagy and SnRK1 pathways, and metabolic reconfigurations that enable survival under prolonged darkness.</p>

Control of Adventitious Root Architecture in Rice by Darkness, Light, and Gravity
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) is a semiaquatic plant that is well adapted to partial flooding. Rice stems develop adventitious root (AR) primordia at each node that slowly mature but emerge only when the plant gets flooded, leading to the formation of a whole new secondary root system upon flooding. AR growth is induced by ethylene that accumulates in submerged plant tissues due to its lowered diffusion rate in water. Here, we report that the architecture of the secondary root system in flooded rice plants is controlled not only by altered gas diffusion but also by gravity and light. While ethylene promotes the emergence and growth of ARs, gravity and light determine their gravitropic setpoint angle (i.e. the deviation of growth direction relative to vertical). ARs grow upward at about 120° in the dark and downward at 54° in the light. The upward growth direction is conserved in <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i> rice varieties, suggestive of a conserved trait in rice. Experiments with a klinostat and with inverted stem orientation revealed that gravity promotes upward growth by about 10°. Red, far-red, and blue light lead to negative phototropism in a dose-dependent manner, with blue light being most effective, indicating that phytochrome and blue light signaling control AR system architecture. The <i>cpt1</i> (<i>coleoptile phototropism1</i>) mutant, which lacks one of the phototropin-interacting CPT proteins, shows reduced sensitivity to blue light. Hence, the gravitropic setpoint angle of rice ARs is controlled by genetic and environmental factors that likely balance the need for oxygen supply (upward growth) with avoidance of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation (downward growth).</p>

In Silico Analysis of the Regulation of the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain in C3 Plants<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[OPEN]</sup></xref>
<p>We present a new simulation model of the reactions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain of C3 species. We show that including recent insights about the regulation of the thylakoid proton motive force, ATP/NADPH balancing mechanisms (cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport), and regulation of Rubisco activity leads to emergent behaviors that may affect the operation and regulation of photosynthesis under different dynamic environmental conditions. The model was parameterized with experimental results in the literature, with a focus on Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). A dataset was constructed from multiple sources, including measurements of steady-state and dynamic gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ance spectroscopy under different light intensities and CO<sub>2</sub>, to test predictions of the model under different experimental conditions. Simulations suggested that there are strong interactions between cyclic and noncyclic alternative electron transport and that an excess capacity for alternative electron transport is required to ensure adequate redox state and lumen pH. Furthermore, the model predicted that, under specific conditions, reduction of ferredoxin by plastoquinol is possible after a rapid increase in light intensity. Further analysis also revealed that the relationship between ATP synthesis and proton motive force was highly regulated by the concentrations of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate, and this facilitated an increase in nonphotochemical quenching and proton motive force under conditions where metabolism was limiting, such as low CO<sub>2</sub>, high light intensity, or combined high CO<sub>2</sub> and high light intensity. The model may be used as an in silico platform for future research on the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport.</p>

Leaf and Plant Age Affects Photosynthetic Performance and Photoprotective Capacity
<p>In this work, we studied the changes in high-light tolerance and photosynthetic activity in leaves of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette throughout the vegetative stage of growth. We implemented an image-analysis work flow to analyze the capacity of both the whole plant and individual leaves to cope with excess excitation energy by following the changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ed light energy partitioning. The data show that leaf and plant age are both important factors influencing the fate of excitation energy. During the dark-to-light transition, the age of the plant affects mostly steady-state levels of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching, leading to an increased photosynthetic performance of its leaves. The age of the leaf affects the induction kinetics of nonphotochemical quenching. These observations were confirmed using model selection procedures. We further investigated how different leaves on a rosette acclimate to high light and show that younger leaves are less prone to photoinhibition than older leaves. Our results stress that both plant and leaf age should be taken into consideration during the quantification of photosynthetic and photoprotective traits to produce repeatable and reliable results.</p>

Light Sheet Microscopy Imaging of Light Absorption and Photosynthesis Distribution in Plant Tissue
<p>In vivo variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of photosystem II (PSII) quantum yields in optically dense systems are complicated by steep tissue light gradients due to scattering and absorption. Consequently, externally measured effective PSII quantum yields may be composed of signals derived from cells differentially exposed to actinic light, where cells located deeper inside tissues receive lower irradiance than cells closer to the surface and can display distinct photophysiological status. We demonstrate how measured distributions of PSII quantum yields in plant tissue change under natural tissue light gradients as compared with conventionally measured quantum yields with even exposure to actinic light. This was achieved by applying actinic irradiance perpendicular to one side of thallus cross sections of the aquatic macrophyte <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> with laser light sheets of defined spectral composition, while imaging variable chlorophyll fluorescence from cross sections with a microscope-mounted pulse amplitude-modulated imaging system. We show that quantum yields are highly affected by light gradients and that traditional surface-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements result in substantial underestimations and/or overestimations, depending on incident actinic irradiance. We present a method for using chlorophyll fluorescence profiles in combination with integrating sphere measurements of reflectance and transmittance to calculate depth-resolved photon absorption profiles, which can be used to correct apparent PSII electron transport rates to photons <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ed by PSII. Absorption profiles of the investigated aquatic macrophyte were different in shape from what is typically observed in terrestrial leaves, and based on this finding, we discuss strategies for optimizing photon absorption via modulation of the structural organization of phytoelements according to in situ light environments.</p>

OsHAD1, a Haloacid Dehalogenase-Like APase, Enhances Phosphate Accumulation
<p>Phosphorus (P) deficiency limits plant growth and yield. Since plants can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong> only the inorganic form of P (Pi), a large portion of soil P (organic and inorganic P complexes) remains unused. Here, we identified and characterized a PHR2-regulated, novel low-Pi-responsive haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolase, <i>OsHAD1</i>. While OsHAD1 is a functional HAD protein having both acid phosphatase and phytase activities, it showed little homology with other known low-Pi-responsive HAD superfamily members. Recombinant OsHAD1 is active at acidic pH and dephosphorylates a broad range of organic and inorganic P-containing substrates, including phosphorylated serine and sodium phytate. Exogenous application of recombinant OsHAD1 protein in growth medium supplemented with phytate led to marked increases in growth and total P content of Pi-deficient wild-type rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, overexpression of <i>OsHAD1</i> in rice resulted in enhanced phosphatase activity, biomass, and total and soluble P contents in Pi-deficient transgenic seedlings treated with phytate as a restricted Pi source. Gene expression and metabolite profiling revealed enhanced Pi starvation responses, such as up-regulation of multiple genes involved in Pi uptake and solubilization, accumulation of organic acids, enhanced secretory phosphatase activity, and depletion of ATP in overexpression lines as compared with the wild type. To elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms of OsHAD1, we performed in vitro pull-down assays, which revealed the association of OsHAD1 with protein kinases such as OsNDPKs. We conclude that, besides dephosphorylation of cellular organic P, OsHAD1 in coordination with kinases may regulate the phosphorylation status of downstream targets to accomplish Pi homeostasis under limited Pi supply.</p>

Importance of Fluctuations in Light on Plant Photosynthetic Acclimation
<p>The acclimation of plants to light has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effect of dynamic fluctuations in light on plant phenotype and acclimatory responses. We mimicked natural fluctuations in light over a diurnal period to examine the effect on the photosynthetic processes and growth of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). High and low light intensities, delivered via a realistic dynamic fluctuating or square wave pattern, were used to grow and assess plants. Plants subjected to square wave light had thicker leaves and greater photosynthetic capacity compared with fluctuating light-grown plants. This, together with elevated levels of proteins associated with electron transport, indicates greater investment in leaf structural components and photosynthetic processes. In contrast, plants grown under fluctuating light had thinner leaves, lower leaf light absorption, but maintained similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area to square wave-grown plants. Despite high light use efficiency, plants grown under fluctuating light had a slow growth rate early in development, likely due to the fact that plants grown under fluctuating conditions were not able to fully utilize the light energy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ed for carbon fixation. Diurnal leaf-level measurements revealed a negative feedback control of photosynthesis, resulting in a decrease in total diurnal carbon assimilated of at least 20%. These findings highlight that growing plants under square wave growth conditions ultimately fails to predict plant performance under realistic light regimes and stress the importance of considering fluctuations in incident light in future experiments that aim to infer plant productivity under natural conditions in the field.</p>

CNGC2 Is a Ca<sup>2+</sup> Influx Channel That Prevents Accumulation of Apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the Leaf
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ed by roots and transported upward through the xylem to the apoplastic space of the leaf, after which it is deposited into the leaf cell. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the tonoplast-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transporters CATION EXCHANGER1 (CAX1) and CAX3 sequester Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the vacuole, but it is not known what transporter mediates the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the apoplast to the cytosol. Here, we report that Arabidopsis <i>CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDE-GATED CHANNEL2</i> (<i>CNGC2</i>) encodes a protein with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx channel activity and is expressed in the leaf areas surrounding the free endings of minor veins, which is the primary site for Ca<sup>2+</sup> unloading from the vasculature and influx into leaf cells. Under hydroponic growth conditions, with 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup>, both Arabidopsis <i>cngc2</i> and <i>cax1cax3</i> loss-of-function mutants grew normally. Increasing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 10 m<sc>m</sc> induced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, cell death, and leaf senescence and partially suppressed the hypersensitive response to avirulent pathogens in the mutants but not in the wild type. In vivo apoplastic Ca<sup>2+</sup> overaccumulation was found in the leaves of <i>cngc2</i> and <i>cax1cax</i>3 but not the wild type under the 10 m<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition, as monitored by Oregon Green BAPTA 488 5N, a low-affinity and membrane-impermeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe. Our results indicate that CNGC2 likely has no direct roles in leaf development or the hypersensitive response but, instead, that CNGC2 could mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into leaf cells. Finally, the in vivo extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging method developed in this study provides a new tool for investigating Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in plant cells.</p>

High-Throughput Phenotyping of Maize Leaf Physiological and Biochemical Traits Using Hyperspectral Reflectance
<p>High-throughput, noninvasive field phenotyping has revealed genetic variation in crop morphological, developmental, and agronomic traits, but rapid measurements of the underlying physiological and biochemical traits are needed to fully understand genetic variation in plant-environment interactions. This study tested the application of leaf hyperspectral reflectance (λ = 500–2,400 nm) as a high-throughput phenotyping approach for rapid and accurate assessment of leaf photosynthetic and biochemical traits in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Leaf traits were measured with standard wet-laboratory and gas-exchange approaches alongside measurements of leaf reflectance. Partial least-squares regression was used to develop a measure of leaf chlorophyll content, nitrogen content, sucrose content, specific leaf area, maximum rate of phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate carboxylation, [CO<sub>2</sub>]-saturated rate of photosynthesis, and leaf oxygen radical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ance capacity from leaf reflectance spectra. Partial least-squares regression models accurately predicted five out of seven traits and were more accurate than previously used simple spectral indices for leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen content, and specific leaf area. Correlations among leaf traits and statistical inferences about differences among genotypes and treatments were similar for measured and modeled data. The hyperspectral reflectance approach to phenotyping was dramatically faster than traditional measurements, enabling over 1,000 rows to be phenotyped during midday hours over just 2 to 4 d, and offers a nondestructive method to accurately assess physiological and biochemical trait responses to environmental stress.</p>

Network-Guided GWAS Improves Identification of Genes Affecting Free Amino Acids
<p>Amino acids are essential for proper growth and development in plants. Amino acids serve as building blocks for proteins but also are important for responses to stress and the biosynthesis of numerous essential compounds. In seed, the pool of free amino acids (FAAs) also contributes to alternative energy, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation, and seed vigor; thus, manipulating FAA levels can significantly impact a seed’s nutritional qualities. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on branched-chain amino acids have identified some regulatory genes controlling seed FAAs, the genetic regulation of FAA levels, composition, and homeostasis in seeds remains mostly unresolved. Hence, we performed GWAS on 18 FAAs from a 313-ecotype Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) association panel. Specifically, GWAS was performed on 98 traits derived from known amino acid metabolic pathways (approach 1) and then on 92 traits generated from an unbiased correlation-based metabolic network analysis (approach 2), and the results were compared. The latter approach facilitated the discovery of additional novel metabolic interactions and single-nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations not identified by the former approach. The most prominent network-guided GWAS signal was for a histidine (His)-related trait in a region containing two genes: a cationic amino acid transporter (CAT4) and a polynucleotide phosphorylase resistant to inhibition with fosmidomycin. A reverse genetics approach confirmed CAT4 to be responsible for the natural variation of His-related traits across the association panel. Given that His is a semiessential amino acid and a potent metal chelator, CAT4 orthologs could be considered as candidate genes for seed quality biofortification in crop plants.</p>

Reversible Leaf Xylem Collapse: A Potential “Circuit Breaker” against Cavitation
<p>We report a novel form of xylem dysfunction in angiosperms: reversible collapse of the xylem conduits of the smallest vein orders that demarcate and intrusively irrigate the areoles of red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy revealed gradual increases in collapse from approximately −2 MPa down to −3 MPa, saturating thereafter (to −4 MPa). Over this range, cavitation remained negligible in these veins. Imaging of rehydration experiments showed spatially variable recovery from collapse within 20 s and complete recovery after 2 min. More broadly, the patterns of deformation induced by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation in both mesophyll and xylem suggest that cell wall collapse is unlikely to depend solely on individual wall properties, as mechanical constraints imposed by neighbors appear to be important. From the perspective of equilibrium leaf water potentials, petioles, whose vessels extend into the major veins, showed a vulnerability to cavitation that overlapped in the water potential domain with both minor vein collapse and buckling (turgor loss) of the living cells. However, models of transpiration transients showed that minor vein collapse and mesophyll capacitance could effectively buffer major veins from cavitation over time scales relevant to the rectification of stomatal wrong-way responses. We suggest that, for angiosperms, whose subsidiary cells give up large volumes to allow large stomatal apertures at the cost of potentially large wrong-way responses, vein collapse could make an important contribution to these plants’ ability to transpire near the brink of cavitation-inducing water potentials.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems perform the crucial task of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ing water from the soil to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of drought stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that drought-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine root cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine root hydraulic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate drought stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild drought stress (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased drought stress was embolism formation observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the fine roots (50% loss of hydraulic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine roots function like hydraulic fuses that decouple plants from drying soil, thus preserving the hydraulic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of drought stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine root mortality and turnover under drought stress.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly resolved and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each resolving 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">absorb</span></strong>ance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and resolved a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly resolved continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Artemin, a diapause-specific chaperone, contributes to the stress tolerance of <i>Artemia franciscana</i> cysts and influences their release from females
<p>Females of the crustacean <i>Artemia franciscana</i> produce either motile nauplii or gastrula stage embryos enclosed in a shell impermeable to nonvolatile compounds and known as cysts. The encysted embryos enter diapause, a state of greatly reduced metabolism and profound stress tolerance. Artemin, a diapause-specific ferritin homolog in cysts has molecular chaperone activity <i>in vitro</i>. Artemin represents 7.2% of soluble protein in cysts, approximately equal to the amount of p26, a small heat shock protein. However, there is almost twice as much artemin mRNA in cysts as compared with p26 mRNA, suggesting that artemin mRNA is translated less efficiently. RNA interference employing the injection of artemin double-stranded RNA into the egg sacs of <i>A. franciscana</i> females substantially reduced artemin mRNA and protein in cysts. Decreasing artemin diminished <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation and freezing tolerance of cysts, demonstrating a role for this protein in stress resistance. Knockdown of artemin increased the time required for complete discharge of a brood of cysts carried within a female from a few hours up to 4 days, an effect weakened in successive broods. Artemin, an abundant molecular chaperone, contributes to stress tolerance of <i>A. franciscana</i> cysts while influencing their development and/or exit from females.</p>

<i>Arabidopsis</i> homeodomain-leucine zipper IV proteins promote stomatal development and ectopically induce stomata beyond the epidermis
<p>The shoot epidermis of land plants serves as a crucial interface between plants and the atmosphere: pavement cells protect plants from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">desicc</span></strong>ation and other environmental stresses, while stomata facilitate gas exchange and transpiration. Advances have been made in our understanding of stomatal patterning and differentiation, and a set of ‘master regulatory’ transcription factors of stomatal development have been identified. However, they are limited to specifying stomatal differentiation within the epidermis. Here, we report the identification of an <i>Arabidopsis</i> homeodomain-leucine zipper IV (HD-ZIP IV) protein, HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS2 (HDG2), as a key epidermal component promoting stomatal differentiation. HDG2 is highly enriched in meristemoids, which are transient-amplifying populations of stomatal-cell lineages. Ectopic expression of <i>HDG2</i> confers differentiation of stomata in internal mesophyll tissues and occasional multiple epidermal layers. Conversely, a loss-of-function <i>hdg2</i> mutation delays stomatal differentiation and, rarely but consistently, results in aberrant stomata. A closely related <i>HD-ZIP IV</i> gene, <i>Arabidopsis thaliana MERISTEM LAYER1</i> (<i>AtML1</i>), shares overlapping function with <i>HDG2</i>: <i>AtML1</i> overexpression also triggers ectopic stomatal differentiation in the mesophyll layer and <i>atml1</i> mutation enhances the stomatal differentiation defects of <i>hdg2</i>. Consistently, HDG2 and AtML1 bind the same DNA elements, and activate transcription in yeast. Furthermore, HDG2 transactivates expression of genes that regulate stomatal development <i>in planta</i>. Our study highlights the similarities and uniqueness of these two <i>HD-ZIP IV</i> genes in the specification of protodermal identity and stomatal differentiation beyond predetermined tissue layers.</p>

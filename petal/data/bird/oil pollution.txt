Size-dependent enhancement of water relations during post-fire resprouting
<p>In resprouting species, fire-induced topkill causes a reduction in height and leaf area without a comparable reduction in the size of the root system, which should lead to an increase in the efficiency of water transport after fire. However, large plants undergo a greater relative reduction in size, compared with small plants, so we hypothesized that this enhancement in hydraulic efficiency would be greatest among large growth forms. In the ecotone between long-leaf pine (<i>Pinus palustris</i> Mill.) savannas and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wetland</span></strong>s, we measured stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>s</sub>), mid-day leaf water potential (<i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>), leaf-specific whole-plant hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>), leaf area and height of 10 species covering a range of growth forms in burned and unburned sites. As predicted, <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was higher in post-fire resprouts than in unburned plants, and the post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was positively related to plant size. Specifically, large-statured species tended to undergo the greatest relative reductions in leaf area and height, and correspondingly experienced the greatest increases in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub>. The post-fire increase in <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> was smaller than expected, however, due to a decrease in absolute root hydraulic conductance (i.e., not scaled to leaf area). The higher <i>K</i><sub>L.p</sub> in burned sites was manifested as an increase in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> rather than an increase in <i>Ψ</i><sub>leaf</sub>. Post-fire increases in <i>g</i><sub>s</sub> should promote high rates of photosynthesis for recovery of carbohydrate reserves and aboveground biomass, which is particularly important for large-statured species that require more time to recover their pre-fire size.</p>

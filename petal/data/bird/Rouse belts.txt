Searching for hidden earthquakes in Southern California
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es follow a well-known power-law size relation, with smaller events occurring much more often than larger events. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e catalogs are thus dominated by small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es yet are still missing a much larger number of even smaller events because of signal fidelity issues. To overcome these limitations, we applied a template-matching detection technique to the entire waveform archive of the regional seismic network in Southern California. This effort resulted in a catalog with 1.81 million <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es, a 10-fold increase, which provides important insights into the geometry of fault zones at depth, foreshock behavior and nucleation processes, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e-triggering mechanisms. The rich detail resolved in this type of catalog will facilitate the next generation of analyses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es and faults.</p>

Seasonal water storage, stress modulation, and California seismicity
<p>Establishing what controls the timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es is fundamental to understanding the nature of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e cycle and critical to determining time-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e hazard. Seasonal loading provides a natural laboratory to explore the crustal response to a quantifiable transient force. In California, water storage deforms the crust as snow and water accumulates during the wet winter months. We used 9 years of global positioning system (GPS) vertical deformation time series to constrain models of monthly hydrospheric loading and the resulting stress changes on fault planes of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es. The seasonal loading analysis reveals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es occurring more frequently during stress conditions that favor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e rupture. We infer that California seismicity rates are modestly modulated by natural hydrological loading cycles.</p>

The November 2017 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 5.5 Pohang earthquake: A possible case of induced seismicity in South Korea
<p>The moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 5.5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e that struck South Korea in November 2017 was one of the largest and most damaging events in that country over the past century. Its proximity to an enhanced geothermal system site, where high-pressure hydraulic injection had been performed during the previous 2 years, raises the possibility that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e was anthropogenic. We have combined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seismolog</span></strong>ical and geodetic analyses to characterize the mainshock and its largest aftershocks, constrain the geometry of this seismic sequence, and shed light on its causal factors. According to our analysis, it seems plausible that the occurrence of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e was influenced by the aforementioned industrial activities. Finally, we found that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e transferred static stress to larger nearby faults, potentially increasing the seismic hazard in the area.</p>

The hidden simplicity of subduction megathrust earthquakes
<p>The largest observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es occur on subduction interfaces and frequently cause widespread damage and loss of life. Understanding the rupture behavior of megathrust events is crucial for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e rupture physics, as well as for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e early-warning systems. However, the large variability in behavior between individual events seemingly defies a description with a simple unifying model. Here we use three source time function (STF) data sets for subduction zone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es, with moment magnitude <i>M</i><sub>w </sub>≥ 7, and show that such large ruptures share a typical universal behavior. The median STF is scalable between events with different sizes, grows linearly, and is nearly triangular. The deviations from the median behavior are multiplicative and Gaussian—that is, they are proportionally larger for larger events. Our observations suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e magnitudes cannot be predicted from the characteristics of rupture onsets.</p>

Recurring and triggered slow-slip events near the trench at the Nankai Trough subduction megathrust
<p>The discovery of slow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es has revolutionized the field of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seismolog</span></strong>y. Defining the locations of these events and the conditions that favor their occurrence provides important insights into the slip behavior of tectonic faults. We report on a family of recurring slow-slip events (SSEs) on the plate interface immediately seaward of repeated historical moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e rupture areas offshore of Japan. The SSEs continue for days to several weeks, include both spontaneous and triggered slip, recur every 8 to 15 months, and are accompanied by swarms of low-frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tremor</span></strong>s. We can explain the SSEs with 1 to 4 centimeters of slip along the megathrust, centered 25 to 35 kilometers (km) from the trench (4 to 10 km depth). The SSEs accommodate 30 to 55% of the plate motion, indicating frequent release of accumulated strain near the trench.</p>

Complex multifault rupture during the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.8 Kaikōura earthquake, New Zealand
<p>On 14 November 2016, northeastern South Island of New Zealand was struck by a major moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 7.8 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e. Field observations, in conjunction with interferometric synthetic aperture radar, Global Positioning System, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seismolog</span></strong>y data, reveal this to be one of the most complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es ever recorded. The rupture propagated northward for more than 170 kilometers along both mapped and unmapped faults before continuing offshore at the island’s northeastern extent. Geodetic and field observations reveal surface ruptures along at least 12 major faults, including possible slip along the southern Hikurangi subduction interface; extensive uplift along much of the coastline; and widespread anelastic deformation, including the ~8-meter uplift of a fault-bounded block. This complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e defies many conventional assumptions about the degree to which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e ruptures are controlled by fault segmentation and should motivate reevaluation of these issues in seismic hazard models.</p>

Volcanic tremor and plume height hysteresis from Pavlof Volcano, Alaska
<p>The March 2016 eruption of Pavlof <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>, Alaska, produced an ash plume that caused the cancellation of more than 100 flights in North America. The eruption generated strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tremor</span></strong> that was recorded by seismic and remote low-frequency acoustic (infrasound) stations, including the EarthScope Transportable Array. The relationship between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tremor</span></strong> amplitudes and plume height changes considerably between the waxing and waning portions of the eruption. Similar hysteresis has been observed between seismic river noise and discharge during storms, suggesting that flow and erosional processes in both rivers and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>es can produce irreversible structural changes that are detectable in geophysical data. We propose that the time-varying relationship at Pavlof arose from changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tremor</span></strong> source related to volcanic vent erosion. This relationship may improve estimates of volcanic emissions and characterization of eruption size and intensity.</p>

A radiation belt of energetic protons located between Saturn and its rings
<p>Saturn has a sufficiently strong dipole magnetic field to trap high-energy charged particles and form radiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong>s, which have been observed outside its rings. Whether stable radiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong>s exist near the planet and inward of the rings was previously unknown. The Cassini spacecraft’s Magnetosphere Imaging Instrument obtained measurements of a radiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> that lies just above Saturn’s dense atmosphere and is decoupled from the rest of the magnetosphere by the planet’s A- to C-rings. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> extends across the D-ring and comprises protons produced through cosmic ray albedo neutron decay and multiple charge-exchange reactions. These protons are lost to atmospheric neutrals and D-ring dust. Strong proton depletions that map onto features on the D-ring indicate a highly structured and diverse dust environment near Saturn.</p>

Observations and modeling of the elastogravity signals preceding direct seismic waves
<p>After an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e, the earliest deformation signals are not expected to be carried by the fastest (<i>P</i>) elastic waves but by the speed-of-light changes of the gravitational field. However, these perturbations are weak and, so far, their detection has not been accurate enough to fully understand their origins and to use them for a highly valuable rapid estimate of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e magnitude. We show that gravity perturbations are particularly well observed with broadband seismometers at distances between 1000 and 2000 kilometers from the source of the 2011, moment magnitude 9.1, Tohoku <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e. We can accurately model them by a new formalism, taking into account both the gravity changes and the gravity-induced motion.

Imaging the distribution of transient viscosity after the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.1 Kumamoto earthquake
<p>The deformation of mantle and crustal rocks in response to stress plays a crucial role in the distribution of seismic and volcanic hazards, controlling tectonic processes ranging from continental drift to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e triggering. However, the spatial variation of these dynamic properties is poorly understood as they are difficult to measure. We exploited the large stress perturbation incurred by the 2016 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e sequence in Kumamoto, Japan, to directly image localized and distributed deformation. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es illuminated distinct regions of low effective viscosity in the lower crust, notably beneath the Mount Aso and Mount Kuju <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>es, surrounded by larger-scale variations of viscosity across the back-arc.

Mega-earthquakes rupture flat megathrusts
<p>The 2004 Sumatra-Andaman and 2011 Tohoku-Oki <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es highlighted gaps in our understanding of mega-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e rupture processes and the factors controlling their global distribution: A fast convergence rate and young buoyant lithosphere are not required to produce mega-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es. We calculated the curvature along the major subduction zones of the world, showing that mega-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es preferentially rupture flat (low-curvature) interfaces. A simplified analytic model demonstrates that heterogeneity in shear strength increases with curvature. Shear strength on flat megathrusts is more homogeneous, and hence more likely to be exceeded simultaneously over large areas, than on highly curved faults.</p>

The 2018 rift eruption and summit collapse of Kīlauea Volcano
<p>In 2018, Kīlauea Volcano experienced its largest lower East Rift Zone (LERZ) eruption and caldera collapse in at least 200 years. After collapse of the Pu‘u ‘Ō‘ō vent on 30 April, magma propagated downrift. Eruptive fissures opened in the LERZ on 3 May, eventually extending ~6.8 kilometers. A 4 May <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e [moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>) 6.9] produced ~5 meters of fault slip. Lava erupted at rates exceeding 100 cubic meters per second, eventually covering 35.5 square kilometers. The summit magma system partially drained, producing minor explosions and near-daily collapses releasing energy equivalent to <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 4.7 to 5.4 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es. Activity declined rapidly on 4 August. Summit collapse and lava flow volume estimates are roughly equivalent—about 0.8 cubic kilometers. Careful historical observation and monitoring of Kīlauea enabled successful forecasting of hazardous events.</p>

Ultrastable laser interferometry for earthquake detection with terrestrial and submarine cables
<p>Detecting ocean-floor seismic activity is crucial for our understanding of the interior structure and dynamic behavior of Earth. However, 70% of the planet’s surface is covered by water, and seismometer coverage is limited to a handful of permanent ocean bottom stations. We show that existing telecommunication optical fiber cables can detect seismic events when combined with state-of-the-art frequency metrology techniques by using the fiber itself as the sensing element. We detected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es over terrestrial and submarine links with lengths ranging from 75 to 535 kilometers and a geographical distance from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e’s epicenter ranging from 25 to 18,500 kilometers.

Hydraulic fracturing volume is associated with induced earthquake productivity in the Duvernay play
<p>A sharp increase in the frequency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es near Fox Creek, Alberta, began in December 2013 in response to hydraulic fracturing. Using a hydraulic fracturing database, we explore relationships between injection parameters and seismicity response. We show that induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es are associated with completions that used larger injection volumes (10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> cubic meters) and that seismic productivity scales linearly with injection volume. Injection pressure and rate have an insignificant association with seismic response. Further findings suggest that geological factors play a prominent role in seismic productivity, as evidenced by spatial correlations. Together, volume and geological factors account for ~96% of the variability in the induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e rate near Fox Creek. This result is quantified by a seismogenic index–modified frequency-magnitude distribution, providing a framework to forecast induced seismicity.</p>

Release of mineral-bound water prior to subduction tied to shallow seismogenic slip off Sumatra
<p>Plate-boundary fault rupture during the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman subduction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e extended closer to the trench than expected, increasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e and tsunami size. International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 362 sampled incoming sediments offshore northern Sumatra, revealing recent release of fresh water within the deep sediments. Thermal modeling links this freshening to amorphous silica dehydration driven by rapid burial-induced temperature increases in the past 9 million years. Complete dehydration of silicates is expected before plate subduction, contrasting with prevailing models for subduction seismogenesis calling for fluid production during subduction. Shallow slip offshore Sumatra appears driven by diagenetic strengthening of deeply buried fault-forming sediments, contrasting with weakening proposed for the shallow Tohoku-Oki 2011 rupture, but our results are applicable to other thickly sedimented subduction zones including those with limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e records.</p>

Fault activation by hydraulic fracturing in western Canada
<p>Hydraulic fracturing has been inferred to trigger the majority of injection-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es in western Canada, in contrast to the Midwestern United States, where massive saltwater disposal is the dominant triggering mechanism. A template-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e catalog from a seismically active Canadian shale play, combined with comprehensive injection data during a 4-month interval, shows that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es are tightly clustered in space and time near hydraulic fracturing sites. The largest event [moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>W</sub>) 3.9] occurred several weeks after injection along a fault that appears to extend from the injection zone into crystalline basement. Patterns of seismicity indicate that stress changes during operations can activate fault slip to an offset distance of >1 km, whereas pressurization by hydraulic fracturing into a fault yields episodic seismicity that can persist for months.</p>

The coseismic surface ruptures cut Aso caldera, including two volcanic cones inside it, but terminate therein.

Fluid-induced aseismic fault slip outpaces pore-fluid migration
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e swarms attributed to subsurface fluid injection are usually assumed to occur on faults destabilized by increased pore-fluid pressures. However, fluid injection could also activate aseismic slip, which might outpace pore-fluid migration and transmit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e-triggering stress changes beyond the fluid-pressurized region. We tested this theoretical prediction against data derived from fluid-injection experiments that activated and measured slow, aseismic slip on preexisting, shallow faults. We found that the pore pressure and slip history imply a fault whose strength is the product of a slip-weakening friction coefficient and the local effective normal stress. Using a coupled shear-rupture model, we derived constraints on the hydromechanical parameters of the actively deforming fault. The inferred aseismic rupture front propagates faster and to larger distances than the diffusion of pressurized pore fluid.</p>

Impact craters on Pluto and Charon indicate a deficit of small Kuiper belt objects

Impact craters on Pluto and Charon were formed by collisions with other Kuiper <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> objects (KBOs) with diameters from ~40 kilometers to ~300 meters, smaller than most KBOs observed directly by telescopes. We find a relative paucity of small craters ≲13 kilometers in diameter, which cannot be explained solely by geological resurfacing. This implies a deficit of small KBOs (≲1 to 2 kilometers in diameter). Some surfaces on Pluto and Charon are likely ≳4 billion years old, thus their crater records provide information on the size-frequency distribution of KBOs in the early Solar System.</p>

The spatial footprint of injection wells in a global compilation of induced earthquake sequences
<p>Fluid injection can cause extensive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e activity, sometimes at unexpectedly large distances. Appropriately mitigating associated seismic hazards requires a better understanding of the zone of influence of injection. We analyze spatial seismicity decay in a global dataset of 18 induced cases with clear association between isolated wells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es. We distinguish two populations. The first is characterized by near-well seismicity density plateaus and abrupt decay, dominated by square-root space-time migration and pressure diffusion. Injection at these sites occurs within the crystalline basement. The second population exhibits larger spatial footprints and magnitudes, as well as a power law–like, steady spatial decay over more than 10 kilometers, potentially caused by poroelastic effects. Far-reaching spatial effects during injection may increase event magnitudes and seismic hazard beyond expectations based on purely pressure-driven seismicity.</p>

Surface uplift and time-dependent seismic hazard due to fluid injection in eastern Texas

Using measurements of uplift, reported injection data, and a poroelastic model, we computed the crustal strain and pore pressure. We infer that an increase of >1 megapascal in pore pressure in rocks with low compressibility triggers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es, including the 4.8–moment magnitude event that occurred on 17 May 2012, the largest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e recorded in eastern Texas.

There is no spectral distinction between plateaux and the rest of the C ring, whereas the region outward of the Keeler gap is spectrally distinct from nearby regions. These results likely indicate that radial stratification of particle physical properties, rather than compositional differences, is responsible for producing these ring structures.</p>

However, these waves have been elusive in the direct seismic wavefield because of their small amplitudes. We devised a new method to detect <i>J</i> waves in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e coda correlation wavefield. They manifest through the similarity with other compressional core-sensitive signals. The inner core is solid, but relatively soft, with shear-wave speeds and shear moduli of 3.42 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 149.0 ± 1.6 gigapascals (GPa) near the inner core boundary and 3.58 ± 0.02 kilometers per second and 167.4 ± 1.6 GPa in Earth’s center. The values are 2.5% lower than the widely used Preliminary Earth Reference Model. This provides new constraints on the dynamical interpretation of Earth’s inner core.</p>

The rise, collapse, and compaction of Mt. Mantap from the 3 September 2017 North Korean nuclear test
<p>Surveillance of clandestine nuclear tests relies on a global seismic network, but the potential of spaceborne monitoring has been underexploited. We used satellite radar imagery to determine the complete surface displacement field of up to 3.5 meters of divergent horizontal motion with 0.5 meters of subsidence associated with North Korea’s largest underground nuclear test. Combining insight from geodetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seismolog</span></strong>ical remote sensing, we found that the aftermath of the initial explosive deformation involved subsidence associated with subsurface collapse and aseismic compaction of the damaged rocks of the test site. The explosive yield from the nuclear detonation with best-fitting source parameters for 450-meter depth was 191 kilotonnes of TNT equivalent. Our results demonstrate the capability of spaceborne remote sensing to help characterize large underground nuclear tests.</p>

Oklahoma's induced seismicity strongly linked to wastewater injection depth
<p>The sharp rise in Oklahoma seismicity since 2009 is due to wastewater injection. The role of injection depth is an open, complex issue, yet critical for hazard assessment and regulation. We developed an advanced Bayesian network to model joint conditional dependencies between spatial, operational, and seismicity parameters. We found that injection depth relative to crystalline basement most strongly correlates with seismic moment release. The joint effects of depth and volume are critical, as injection rate becomes more influential near the basement interface. Restricting injection depths to 200 to 500 meters above basement could reduce annual seismic moment release by a factor of 1.4 to 2.8. Our approach enables identification of subregions where targeted regulation may mitigate effects of induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es, aiding operators and regulators in wastewater disposal regions.</p>

Spaceborne detection of localized carbon dioxide sources
<p>Spaceborne measurements by NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) at the kilometer scale reveal distinct structures of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) caused by known anthropogenic and natural point sources. OCO-2 transects across the Los Angeles megacity (USA) show that anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> enhancements peak over the urban core and decrease through suburban areas to rural background values more than ~100 kilometers away, varying seasonally from ~4.4 to 6.1 parts per million. A transect passing directly downwind of the persistent isolated natural CO<sub>2</sub> plume from Yasur <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong> (Vanuatu) shows a narrow filament of enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> values (~3.4 parts per million), consistent with a CO<sub>2</sub> point source emitting 41.6 kilotons per day. These examples highlight the potential of the OCO-2 sensor, with its unprecedented resolution and sensitivity, to detect localized natural and anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> sources.</p>

Tsunami-driven rafting: Transoceanic species dispersal and implications for marine biogeography
<p>The 2011 East Japan <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>e generated a massive tsunami that launched an extraordinary transoceanic biological rafting event with no known historical precedent. We document 289 living Japanese coastal marine species from 16 phyla transported over 6 years on objects that traveled thousands of kilometers across the Pacific Ocean to the shores of North America and Hawai‘i. Most of this dispersal occurred on nonbiodegradable objects, resulting in the longest documented transoceanic survival and dispersal of coastal species by rafting. Expanding shoreline infrastructure has increased global sources of plastic materials available for biotic colonization and also interacts with climate change–induced storms of increasing severity to eject debris into the oceans. In turn, increased ocean rafting may intensify species invasions.</p>

Identification of a primordial asteroid family constrains the original planetesimal population
<p>A quarter of known asteroids is associated with more than 100 distinct asteroid families, meaning that these asteroids originate as impact fragments from the family parent bodies. The determination of which asteroids of the remaining population are members of undiscovered families, or accreted as planetesimals from the protoplanetary disk, would constrain a critical phase of planetary formation by unveiling the unknown planetesimal size distribution. We discovered a 4-billion-year-old asteroid family extending across the entire inner part of the main <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> whose members include most of the dark asteroids previously unlinked to families. This allows us to identify some original planetesimals, which are all larger than 35 kilometers, supporting the view of asteroids being born big. Their number matches the known distinct meteorite parent bodies.</p>

Eutrophication will increase during the 21st century as a result of precipitation changes
<p>Eutrophication, or excessive nutrient enrichment, threatens water resources across the globe. We show that climate change–induced precipitation changes alone will substantially increase (19 ± 14%) riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental United States by the end of the century for the “business-as-usual” scenario. The impacts, driven by projected increases in both total and extreme precipitation, will be especially strong for the Northeast and the corn <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> of the United States. Offsetting this increase would require a 33 ± 24% reduction in nitrogen inputs, representing a massive management challenge. Globally, changes in precipitation are especially likely to also exacerbate eutrophication in India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future changes in precipitation on nitrogen loading.</p>

Seismic evidence for partial melting at the root of major hot spot plumes
<p>Ultralow-velocity zones are localized regions of extreme material properties detected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">seismolog</span></strong>ically at the base of Earth's mantle. Their nature and role in mantle dynamics are poorly understood. We used shear waves diffracted at the core-mantle boundary to illuminate the root of the Iceland plume from different directions. Through waveform modeling, we detected a large ultralow-velocity zone and constrained its shape to be axisymmetric to a very good first order. We thus attribute it to partial melting of a locally thickened, denser- and hotter-than-average layer, reflecting dynamics and elevated temperatures within the plume root. Such structures are few and far apart, and they may be characteristic of the roots of some of the broad mantle plumes tomographically imaged within the large low-shear-velocity provinces in the lower mantle.</p>

Synthesis of a carbon nanobelt
<p>The synthesis of a carbon nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong>, comprising a closed loop of fully fused edge-sharing benzene rings, has been an elusive goal in organic chemistry for more than 60 years. Here we report the synthesis of one such compound through iterative Wittig reactions followed by a nickel-mediated aryl-aryl coupling reaction. The cylindrical shape of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">belt</span></strong> structure was confirmed by x-ray crystallography, and its fundamental optoelectronic properties were elucidated by ultraviolet-visible absorption, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopic studies, as well as theoretical calculations. This molecule could potentially serve as a seed for the preparation of structurally well-defined carbon nanotubes.</p>

Inflation-predictable behavior and co-eruption deformation at Axial Seamount
<p>Deformation of the ground surface at active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">volcano</span></strong>es provides information about magma movements at depth. Improved seafloor deformation measurements between 2011 and 2015 documented a fourfold increase in magma supply and confirmed that Axial Seamount’s eruptive behavior is inflation-predictable, probably triggered by a critical level of magmatic pressure. A 2015 eruption was successfully forecast on the basis of this deformation pattern and marked the first time that deflation and tilt were captured in real time by a new seafloor cabled observatory, revealing the timing, location, and volume of eruption-related magma movements. Improved modeling of the deformation suggests a steeply dipping prolate-spheroid pressure source beneath the eastern caldera that is consistent with the location of the zone of highest melt within the subcaldera magma reservoir determined from multichannel seismic results.</p>

Rogue protein's partners offer hope in Parkinson's disease
<p>It has been 8 years since an astonishing observation persuaded many scientists that the misfolded protein implicated in Parkinson's disease spreads from brain cell to brain cell, like an infection. Last week, findings presented at the huge annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience further buttressed the theory that spread of the rogue protein, called α-synuclein, is responsible for the progressive disease, which is marked by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tremor</span></strong>, stiff movements, depression, and, ultimately, dementia. Scientists at the San Diego, California, conference also described their discovery that an obscure protein carried on the cell membranes of neurons and other brain cells blocks the uptake of the α-synuclein into cells. Little is known about TM9SF2, but it is part of a family of proteins that span the cell membrane and indications are that it may work to transport specific molecules from the outside to the inside of the cell. It is made in abundance in the brain, especially in regions where damage to dopamine-producing neurons is known to give rise to Parkinson's. If it emerges that it is indeed a "catcher's mitt" for α-synuclein, it could provide a drug target for a disease whose 10 million sufferers are sorely in need of new medicines. The same goes for another cell membrane protein, LAG-3, which is present in neurons and which was recently described in <i>Science </i>as binding tightly to the rogue Parkinson's protein.</p>

Localized seismic deformation in the upper mantle revealed by dense seismic arrays
<p>Seismicity along continental transform faults is usually confined to the upper half of the crust, but the Newport-Inglewood fault (NIF), a major fault traversing the Los Angeles basin, is seismically active down to the upper mantle. We use seismic array analysis to illuminate the seismogenic root of the NIF beneath Long Beach, California, and identify seismicity in an actively deforming localized zone penetrating the lithospheric mantle. Deep <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">earthquak</span></strong>es, which are spatially correlated with geochemical evidence of a fluid pathway from the mantle, as well as with a sharp vertical offset in the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, exhibit narrow size distribution and weak temporal clustering. We attribute these characteristics to a transition from strong to weak interaction regimes in a system of seismic asperities embedded in a ductile fault zone matrix.</p>

Greater Sensitivity to Drought Accompanies Maize Yield Increase in the U.S. Midwest
<sec><title>Predicting Responses to Drought</title><p>The U.S. Corn Belt accounts for a sizeable portion of the world's maize growth. Various influences have increased yields over the years. <bold>Lobell <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 516; see the Perspective by <bold>Ort and Long</bold>) now show that sensitivity to drought has been increasing as well. It seems that as plants have been bred for increased yield under ideal conditions, the plants become more sensitive to non-ideal conditions. A key factor may be the planting density. Although today's maize varieties are more robust to crowding and the farmer can get more plants in per field, this same crowding takes a toll when water resources are limited.</p></sec>

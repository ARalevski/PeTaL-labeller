Day-to-Day Blood Pressure Variability and Risk of Dementia in a General Japanese Elderly Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Several observational studies have reported that higher visit-to-visit blood pressure variability is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. However, no studies have investigated the association of day-to-day blood pressure variability assessed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> blood pressure measurement with the development of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 1674 community-dwelling Japanese elderly without dementia, ≥60 years of age, were followed up for 5 years (2007–2012). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> blood pressure was measured 3 times every morning for a median of 28 days. Day-to-day systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure variabilities, calculated as coefficients of variation (CoV) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> SBP and diastolic blood pressure, were categorized into quartiles. The hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals of the CoV levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> blood pressure on the development of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia (VaD), and Alzheimer disease (AD) were computed with a Cox proportional hazards model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>During the follow-up, 194 subjects developed all-cause dementia; of these, 47 had VaD and 134 had AD. The age- and sex-adjusted incidences of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD increased significantly with increasing CoV levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> SBP (all <i>P</i> for trend <0.05). These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> SBP. Compared with subjects in the first quartile of CoV levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> SBP, the risks of the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD were significantly higher in those in the fourth quartile (hazard ratio=2.27, 95% confidence interval=1.45–3.55, <i>P</i><0.001 for all-cause dementia; hazard ratio=2.79, 95% confidence interval=1.04–7.51, <i>P</i>=0.03 for VaD; hazard ratio=2.22, 95% confidence interval=1.31–3.75, <i>P</i><0.001 for AD). Similar associations were observed for CoV levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> diastolic blood pressure. Meanwhile, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> SBP levels were significantly associated with the risk of VaD but not with the risks of all-cause dementia and AD. There was no interaction between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> SBP levels and CoV levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> SBP on the risk of each subtype of dementia.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that increased day-to-day blood pressure variability is, independently of average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> blood pressure, a significant risk factor for the development of all-cause dementia, VaD, and AD in the general elderly Japanese population.</p></sec>

Sources of Sodium in US Adults From 3 Geographic Regions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US adults consume excess sodium. Knowledge about the dietary sources of sodium intake is critical to the development of effective reduction strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 450 adults were recruited from 3 geographic locations: Birmingham, AL (n=150); Palo Alto, CA (n=150); and the Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN (n=150), metropolitan areas. Equal numbers of women and men from each of 4 race/ethnic groups (blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites) were targeted for recruitment. Four record-assisted 24-hour dietary recalls were collected from each participant with special procedures, which included the collection of duplicate samples of salt added to food at the table and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> food preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Sodium added to food outside the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> was the leading source of sodium, accounting for more than two thirds (70.9%) of total sodium intake in the sample. Although the proportion of sodium from this source was smaller in some subgroups, it was the leading contributor for all subgroups. Contribution ranged from 66.3% for those with a high school level of education or less to 75.0% for those 18 to 29 years of age. Sodium inherent to food was the next highest contributor (14.2%), followed by salt added in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> food preparation (5.6%) and salt added to food at the table (4.9%). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> tap water consumed as a beverage and dietary supplement and nonprescription antacids contributed minimally to sodium intake (<0.5% each).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Sodium added to food outside the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> accounted for ≈70% of dietary sodium intake.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
The COMPASS-Like Complex Promotes Flowering and Panicle Branching in Rice
<p>Flowering time (heading date) and panicle branch number are important agronomic traits that determine yield in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The activation of flowering requires histone methylation, but the roles of trimethylation of Lys 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3) in modulating heading date and panicle development are unclear. Here, we showed that the COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle branching. The rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) WD40 protein OsWDR5a interacts with the TRITHORAX-like protein OsTrx1/SET domain group protein 723 (SDG723) to form the core components of the COMPASS-like complex. Plants in which <i>OsWDR5a</i> or <i>OsTrx1</i> expression was decreased by RNA interference produced fewer secondary branches and less grain and exhibited a delayed heading date under long-day and short-day conditions, whereas loss of <i>OsWDR5a</i> function resulted in embryo lethality. OsWDR5a binds to <i>Early heading date 1</i> to regulate its H3K4me3 and expression levels. Together, our results show that the COMPASS-like complex promotes flowering and panicle development and suggest that modulation of H3K4me3 levels by the COMPASS-like complex is critical for rice development.</p>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision   arthroplasty surgery. Proprietary cement preparations containing   vancomycin are available, but are significantly more expensive.   We investigated whether the elution of antibiotic from ‘<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong>-made’   cement containing vancomycin was comparable with more expensive   commercially available vancomycin impregnated cement.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 18 cement discs containing either proprietary CopalG+V;   or ‘<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong>-made’ CopalR+G with vancomycin added by hand, were made.   Each disc contained the same amount of antibiotic (0.5 g gentamycin,   2 g vancomycin) and was immersed in ammonium acetate buffer in a   sealed container. Fluid from each container was sampled at eight   time points over a two-week period. The concentrations of gentamicin   and vancomycin in the fluid were analysed using high performance   liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The highest peak concentrations of antibiotic were observed from   the ‘<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong>-made’ cements containing vancomycin, added as in the operating   theatre. The overall elution of antibiotic was, fivefold (vancomycin)   and twofold (gentamicin) greater from the ‘<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong>-made’ mix compared   with the commercially mixed cement. The use of a vacuum during mixing   had no significant effect on antibiotic elution in any of the samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that the addition of 2 g vancomycin powder   to gentamicin-impregnated bone cement by hand significantly increases   the elution of both antibiotics compared with commercially prepared   cements containing vancomycin. We found no significant advantages   of using expensive commercially produced vancomycin-impregnated cement   and recommend the addition of vancomycin powder by hand in the operating theatre.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:73–7.</p></sec>

Interleukin-10 Inhibits Bone Marrow Fibroblast Progenitor Cell–Mediated Cardiac Fibrosis in Pressure-Overloaded Myocardium
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) play a critical role in cardiac fibrosis; however, their origin in the diseased heart remains unclear, warranting further investigation. Recent studies suggest the contribution of bone marrow fibroblast progenitor cells (BM-FPCs) in pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis. We have previously shown that interleukin-10 (IL10) suppresses pressure overload–induced cardiac fibrosis; however, the role of IL10 in inhibition of BM-FPC–mediated cardiac fibrosis is not known. We hypothesized that IL10 inhibits pressure overload–induced homing of BM-FPCs to the heart and their transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts and thus attenuates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Pressure overload was induced in wild-type (WT) and IL10 knockout (IL10KO) mice by transverse aortic constriction. To determine the bone marrow origin, chimeric mice were created with enhanced green fluorescent protein WT mice marrow to the IL10KO mice. For mechanistic studies, FPCs were isolated from mouse bone marrow.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Pressure overload enhanced BM-FPC mobilization and homing in IL10KO mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore, WT bone marrow (from enhanced green fluorescent protein mice) transplantation in bone marrow–depleted IL10KO mice (IL10KO chimeric mice) reduced transverse aortic constriction–induced BM-FPC mobilization compared with IL10KO mice. Green fluorescent protein costaining with α-smooth muscle actin or collagen 1α in left ventricular tissue sections of IL10KO chimeric mice suggests that myofibroblasts were derived from bone marrow after transverse aortic constriction. Finally, WT bone marrow transplantation in IL10KO mice inhibited transverse aortic constriction–induced cardiac fibrosis and improved heart function. At the molecular level, IL10 treatment significantly inhibited transforming growth factor-β–induced transdifferentiation and fibrotic signaling in WT BM-FPCs in vitro. Furthermore, fibrosis-associated microRNA (miRNA) expression was highly upregulated in IL10KO-FPCs compared with WT-FPCs. Polymerase chain reaction–based selective miRNA analysis revealed that transforming growth factor-β–induced enhanced expression of fibrosis-associated miRNAs (miRNA-21, -145, and -208) was significantly inhibited by IL10. Restoration of miRNA-21 levels suppressed the IL10 effects on transforming growth factor-β–induced fibrotic signaling in BM-FPCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest that IL10 inhibits BM-FPC homing and transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in pressure-overloaded myocardium. Mechanistically, we show for the first time that IL10 suppresses Smad–miRNA-21–mediated activation of BM-FPCs and thus modulates cardiac fibrosis.</p></sec>

Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Data are limited on the implementation of evidence-based multilevel interventions targeted at blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive blacks who receive care in low-resource primary care practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Counseling African Americans to Control Hypertension is a cluster-randomized clinical trial in which 30 community health centers were randomly assigned to the intervention condition (IC) or usual care (UC). Patients at the IC sites received patient education, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> BP monitoring, and monthly lifestyle counseling, whereas physicians attended monthly hypertension case rounds and received feedback on their patients’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> BP readings and chart audits.

ATP promotes the fast migration of dendritic cells through the activity of pannexin 1 channels and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors
<p>Upon its release from injured cells, such as infected, transformed, inflamed, or necrotic cells, extracellular adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) acts as a danger signal that recruits phagocytes, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), to the site of injury. The sensing of extracellular ATP occurs through purinergic (P2) receptors. We investigated the cellular mechanisms linking purinergic signaling to DC motility. We found that ATP stimulated fast DC motility through an autocrine signaling loop, which was initiated by the activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and further amplified by pannexin 1 (Panx1) channels. Upon stimulation of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor by ATP, Panx1 contributed to fast DC motility by increasing the permeability of the plasma membrane, which resulted in supplementary ATP release. In the absence of Panx1, DCs failed to increase their speed of migration in response to ATP, despite exhibiting a normal P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> response. In addition to DC migration, Panx1 channel– and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor–dependent signaling was further required to stimulate the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In vivo, functional Panx1 channels were required for the homing of DCs to lymph nodes, although they were dispensable for DC maturation. These data suggest that P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors and Panx1 channels are crucial players in the regulation of DC migration to endogenous danger signals.</p>

Quantum reference beacon–guided superresolution optical focusing in complex media
<p>Optical scattering is generally considered to be a nuisance of microscopy that limits imaging depth and spatial resolution. Wavefront shaping techniques enable optical imaging at unprecedented depth, but attaining superresolution within complex media remains a challenge. We used a quantum reference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">beacon</span></strong> (QRB), consisting of solid-state quantum emitters with spin-dependent fluorescence, to provide subwavelength guidestar feedback for wavefront shaping to achieve a superresolution optical focus. We implemented the QRB-guided imaging with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond nanocrystals, which enable optical focusing with a subdiffraction resolution below 186 nanometers (less than half the wavelength). QRB-assisted wavefront-shaping should find use in a range of applications, including deep-tissue quantum enhanced sensing and individual optical excitation of magnetically coupled spin ensembles for applications in quantum information processing.</p>

Commensal-specific T cell plasticity promotes rapid tissue adaptation to injury
<p>Barrier tissues are primary targets of environmental stressors and are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> to the largest number of antigen-experienced lymphocytes in the body, including commensal-specific T cells. We found that skin-resident commensal-specific T cells harbor a paradoxical program characterized by a type 17 program associated with a poised type 2 state. Thus, in the context of injury and exposure to inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-18, these cells rapidly release type 2 cytokines, thereby acquiring contextual functions. Such acquisition of a type 2 effector program promotes tissue repair. Aberrant type 2 responses can also be unleashed in the context of local defects in immunoregulation. Thus, commensal-specific T cells co-opt tissue residency and cell-intrinsic flexibility as a means to promote both local immunity and tissue adaptation to injury.</p>

Developmental barcoding of whole mouse via homing CRISPR
<p>In vivo barcoding using nuclease-induced mutations is a powerful approach for recording biological information, including developmental lineages; however, its application in mammalian systems has been limited. We present in vivo barcoding in the mouse with multiple homing guide RNAs that each generate hundreds of mutant alleles and combine to produce an exponential diversity of barcodes. Activation upon conception and continued mutagenesis through gestation resulted in developmentally barcoded mice wherein information is recorded in lineage-specific mutations. We used these recordings for reliable post hoc reconstruction of the earliest lineages and investigation of axis development in the brain. Our results provide an enabling and versatile platform for in vivo barcoding and lineage tracing in a mammalian model system.</p>

Evolutionary history and adaptation of a human pygmy population of Flores Island, Indonesia
<p>Flores Island, Indonesia, was inhabited by the small-bodied hominin species <i>Homo floresiensis</i>, which has an unknown evolutionary relationship to modern humans. This island is also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> to an extant human pygmy population. Here we describe genome-scale single-nucleotide polymorphism data and whole-genome sequences from a contemporary human pygmy population living on Flores near the cave where <i>H. floresiensis</i> was found. The genomes of Flores pygmies reveal a complex history of admixture with Denisovans and Neanderthals but no evidence for gene flow with other archaic hominins. Modern individuals bear the signatures of recent positive selection en<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compass</span></strong>ing the FADS (fatty acid desaturase) gene cluster, likely related to diet, and polygenic selection acting on standing variation that contributed to their short-stature phenotype. Thus, multiple independent instances of hominin insular dwarfism occurred on Flores.</p>

Early farmers from Man Bac in Vietnam exhibit a mixture of East Asian (southern Chinese agriculturalist) and deeply diverged eastern Eurasian (hunter-gatherer) ancestry characteristic of Austroasiatic speakers, with similar ancestry as far south as Indonesia providing evidence for an expansive initial spread of Austroasiatic languages. By the Bronze Age, in a parallel pattern to Europe, sites in Vietnam and Myanmar show close connections to present-day majority groups, reflecting substantial additional influxes of migrants.</p>

The controversial correlates of consciousness
<p>The mechanism of consciousness is one of the most fundamental, exciting, and challenging pursuits in 21st-century science. Although the field of consciousness studies attracts a diverse array of thinkers who posit myriad physical or metaphysical substrates for experience, consciousness must have a neural basis. But where in the brain is conscious experience generated? It would seem that, given this remarkable era of technical and experimental prowess in the neurosciences, we would be homing in on the specific circuits or precise neuronal subpopulations that generate experience. To the contrary, there is still active debate as to whether the neural correlates of consciousness are, in coarse terms, located in the back or the front of the brain (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). On page 537 of this issue, van Vugt <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) provide evidence that the prefrontal cortex is one of the brain regions that mediates visual consciousness. Additionally, Joglekar <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) provide evidence that the prefrontal cortex is important for igniting neural networks that contribute to visual signal processing. Both studies support a model for consciousness that involves distributed and reciprocal interactions across the cortex.</p>

Nobel honors discoveries in how cells eat themselves
<p>As the stench of the streets during a garbage strike quickly drives <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong>, sanitation workers are the unsung heroes of modern cities and towns. Similarly, the cell's garbage collectors are key to health. By performing "autophagy"—literally, self-eating—they degrade or recycle toxic protein aggregates and cell components. This week, the cell biologist who worked out the genetics and mechanics of this process received the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. When Yoshinori Ohsumi, now at the Tokyo Institute of Technology's Frontier Research Center, did his pioneering work in yeast in the early 1990s, his results drew little attention outside cell biology. But in the past 15 years, others have shown that cells' clean-up machinery is crucial to human health.</p>

Non-visual numerical discrimination in a blind cavefish (<i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>)
<p>Over a decade of comparative studies, researchers have found that rudimentary numerical abilities are widespread among vertebrates. While experiments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in <i>Phreatichthys andruzzii</i>, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia desert. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not controlled for non-numerical continuous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli controlled for continuous quantities and half not controlled for continuous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli controlled for continuous quantities proved able to learn the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish tested with visual stimuli.</p>

‘Hot Joints’ infection protocol reduces unnecessary post-operative re-admissions following total hip and knee arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of an institutionally developed   algorithm for evaluation and diagnosis of prosthetic joint injection   and to determine the impact of this protocol on overall hospital   re-admissions.p</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We retrospectively evaluated 2685 total hip arthroplasty (THA)   and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients prior to (1263) and following   (1422) the introduction of an infection detection protocol. The   protocol used conservative thresholds for C-reactive protein to   direct the medical attendant to aspirate the joint. The protocol   incorporated a clear set of laboratory and clinical criteria that   allowed a patient to be discharged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> if all were met. Patients were   included if they presented to our emergency department within 120   days post-operatively with concerns for swelling, pain or infection   and were excluded if they had an unambiguous infection or if their   chief complaint was non-orthopaedic in nature.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Concern for infection was the single most common (32%) reason   for presentation. A total of 296 patients made an emergency visit   and were included following THA or TKA. In the pre-protocol cohort,   11 of 27 patients were formally re-admitted to the hospital with   concern for infection but only five (45%) patients had actual infections   and received additional treatment. In comparison, in the post-protocol   cohort, 11 patients were admitted for suspected infection, nine   (82%) of whom were truly infected (p = 0.04). Sensitivity increased   from 83% to 100% and specificity increased from 71% to 96%. Implementation   of this protocol did not miss any infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A standardised protocol for evaluation of THA and TKA infections   significantly reduced unnecessary hospital re-admissions.

Cost-effective peri-operative pain management
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to determine the optimal regimen for   the management of pain following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) by   comparing the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of different protocols   implemented at a large, urban, academic medical centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between September 2013 and September 2015, we used a series of   modifications to our standard regimen for the management of pain   after TKA. In May 2014, there was a department-wide transition from   protocols focused on femoral nerve blocks (FNB) to periarticular   injections of liposomal bupivacaine. In February 2015, patient-controlled analgesia   (PCA) was removed from the protocol while continuing liposomal bupivacaine   injections. Quality measures and hospital costs were compared between   the three protocols.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The cohort being treated with PCA-less liposomal bupivacaine   injections had a significantly higher percentage of patients who   were discharged to their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> (p = 0.010) and a significantly shorter   length of stay (p < 0.001). Patient-reported Hospital Consumer   Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) scores relating   to pain being “well-controlled” and “overall pain management” also   favoured this cohort (p = 0.214 and p = 0.463, respectively), in   which cost was significantly lower compared with the other two cohorts   (p = 0.005).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The replacement of FNBs injections and the removal of PCAs, both   of which are known to be associated with high rates of adverse outcomes,   and the addition of liposomal bupivacaine periarticular injections   to a multimodal pain regimen, led to improvements in many quality   measures, HCAHPS pain scores, and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B(1   Supple A):55–61.</p></sec>

Conscious Sedation Versus General Anesthesia for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Conscious sedation is used during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with limited evidence as to the safety and efficacy of this practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The National Cardiovascular Data Registry Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry was used to characterize the anesthesia choice and clinical outcomes of all US patients undergoing elective percutaneous transfemoral TAVR between April 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015. Raw and inverse probability of treatment-weighted analyses were performed to compare patients undergoing TAVR with general anesthesia with patients undergoing TAVR with conscious sedation on an intention-to-treat basis for the primary outcome of in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes including 30-day mortality, in-hospital and 30-day death/stroke, procedural success, intensive care unit and hospital length-of-stay, and rates of discharge to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong>. Post hoc falsification end point analyses were performed to evaluate for residual confounding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Conscious sedation was used in 1737/10 997 (15.8%) cases with a significant trend of increasing usage over the time period studied (<i>P</i> for trend<0.001). In raw analyses, intraprocedural success with conscious sedation and general anesthesia was similar (98.2% versus 98.5%, <i>P</i>=0.31). The conscious sedation group was less likely to experience in-hospital (1.6% versus 2.5%, <i>P</i>=0.03) and 30-day death (2.9% versus 4.1%, <i>P</i>=0.03). Conversion from conscious sedation to general anesthesia was noted in 102 of 1737 (5.9%) of conscious sedation cases. After inverse probability of treatment-weighted adjustment for 51 covariates, conscious sedation was associated with lower procedural success (97.9% versus 98.6%, <i>P</i><0.001) and a reduced rate of mortality at the in-hospital (1.5% versus 2.4%, <i>P</i><0.001) and 30-day (2.3% versus 4.0%, <i>P</i><0.001) time points. Conscious sedation was associated with reductions in procedural inotrope requirement, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay (6.0 versus 6.5 days, <i>P</i><0.001), and combined 30-day death/stroke rates (4.8% versus 6.4%, <i>P</i><0.001). Falsification end point analyses of vascular complications, bleeding, and new pacemaker/defibrillator implantation demonstrated no significant differences between groups after adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In US practice, conscious sedation is associated with briefer length of stay and lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality in comparison with TAVR with general anesthesia in both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. These results suggest the safety of conscious sedation in this population, although comparative effectiveness analyses using observational data cannot definitively establish the superiority of one technique over another.</p></sec>

Assessment of the European Society of Cardiology 0-Hour/1-Hour Algorithm to Rule-Out and Rule-In Acute Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The new European Society of Cardiology guidelines to rule-in and rule-out acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the emergency department include a rapid assessment algorithm based on high-sensitivity cardiac troponin and sampling at 0 and 1 hour. Emergency department physicians require high sensitivity to confidently rule-out AMI, whereas cardiologists aim to minimize false-positive results.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>High-sensitivity troponin I and T assays were used to measure troponin concentrations in patients presenting with chest-pain symptoms and being investigated for possible acute coronary syndrome at hospitals in New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. AMI outcomes were independently adjudicated by at least 2 physicians. The European Society of Cardiology algorithm performance with each assay was assessed by the sensitivity and proportion with AMI ruled out and the positive predictive value and proportion ruled-in.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 2222 patients with serial high-sensitivity troponin T and high-sensitivity troponin I measurements. The high-sensitivity troponin T algorithm ruled out 1425 (64.1%) with a sensitivity of 97.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.0%–98.8%) and ruled-in 292 (13.1%) with a positive predictive value of 63.4% (95% CI, 57.5%–68.9%).</p><p>The high-sensitivity troponin I algorithm ruled out 1205 (54.2%) with a sensitivity of 98.8% (95% CI, 96.4%–99.7%)) and ruled-in 310 (14.0%) with a positive predictive value of 68.1% (95% CI, 62.6%–73.2%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The sensitivity of the European Society of Cardiology rapid assessment 0-/1-hour algorithm to rule-out AMI with high-sensitivity troponin may be insufficient for some emergency department physicians to confidently send patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong>.

Cardiovascular Consequences of Childhood Secondhand Tobacco Smoke Exposure: Prevailing Evidence, Burden, and Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although public health programs have led to a substantial decrease in the prevalence of tobacco smoking, the adverse health effects of tobacco smoke exposure are by no means a thing of the past. In the United States, 4 of 10 school-aged children and 1 of 3 adolescents are involuntarily exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS), with children of minority ethnic backgrounds and those living in low-socioeconomic-status households being disproportionately affected (68% and 43%, respectively). Children are particularly vulnerable, with little control over <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> and social environment, and lack the understanding, agency, and ability to avoid SHS exposure on their own volition; they also have physiological or behavioral characteristics that render them especially susceptible to effects of SHS. Side-stream smoke (the smoke emanating from the burning end of the cigarette), a major component of SHS, contains a higher concentration of some toxins than mainstream smoke (inhaled by the smoker directly), making SHS potentially as dangerous as or even more dangerous than direct smoking. Compelling animal and human evidence shows that SHS exposure during childhood is detrimental to arterial function and structure, resulting in premature atherosclerosis and its cardiovascular consequences. Childhood SHS exposure is also related to impaired cardiac autonomic function and changes in heart rate variability. In addition, childhood SHS exposure is associated with clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Individualized interventions to reduce childhood exposure to SHS are shown to be at least modestly effective, as are broader-based policy initiatives such as community smoking bans and increased taxation.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>The purpose of this statement is to summarize the available evidence on the cardiovascular health consequences of childhood SHS exposure; this will support ongoing efforts to further reduce and eliminate SHS exposure in this vulnerable population. This statement reviews relevant data from epidemiological studies, laboratory-based experiments, and controlled behavioral trials concerning SHS and cardiovascular disease risk in children. Information on the effects of SHS exposure on the cardiovascular system in animal and pediatric studies, including vascular disruption and platelet activation, oxidation and inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular stiffness, changes in vascular structure, and autonomic dysfunction, is examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The epidemiological, observational, and experimental evidence accumulated to date demonstrates the detrimental cardiovascular consequences of SHS exposure in children.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications:</title><p>Increased awareness of the adverse, lifetime cardiovascular consequences of childhood SHS may facilitate the development of innovative individual, family-centered, and community health interventions to reduce and ideally eliminate SHS exposure in the vulnerable pediatric population. This evidence calls for a robust public health policy that embraces zero tolerance of childhood SHS exposure.</p></sec>

Adherence to Antihypertensive Treatment and the Blood Pressure–Lowering Effects of Renal Denervation in the Renal Denervation for Hypertension (DENERHTN) Trial
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The DENERHTN trial (Renal Denervation for Hypertension) confirmed the blood pressure–lowering efficacy of renal denervation added to a standardized stepped-care antihypertensive treatment for resistant hypertension at 6 months. We report the influence of adherence to antihypertensive treatment on blood pressure control.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>One hundred six patients with hypertension resistant to 4 weeks of treatment with indapamide 1.5 mg/d, ramipril 10 mg/d (or irbesartan 300 mg/d), and amlodipine 10 mg/d were randomly assigned to renal denervation plus standardized stepped-care antihypertensive treatment, or the same antihypertensive treatment alone. For standardized stepped-care antihypertensive treatment, spironolactone 25 mg/d, bisoprolol 10 mg/d, prazosin 5 mg/d, and rilmenidine 1 mg/d were sequentially added at monthly visits if <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> blood pressure was ≥135/85 mm Hg after randomization. We assessed adherence to antihypertensive treatment at 6 months by drug screening in urine/plasma samples from 85 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The numbers of fully adherent (20/40 versus 21/45), partially nonadherent (13/40 versus 20/45), or completely nonadherent patients (7/40 versus 4/45) to antihypertensive treatment were not different in the renal denervation and the control groups, respectively (<i>P</i>=0.3605). The difference in the change in daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure from baseline to 6 months between the 2 groups was –6.7 mm Hg (<i>P</i>=0.0461) in fully adherent and –7.8 mm Hg (<i>P</i>=0.0996) in nonadherent (partially nonadherent plus completely nonadherent) patients. The between-patient variability of daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure was greater for nonadherent than for fully adherent patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In the DENERHTN trial, the prevalence of nonadherence to antihypertensive drugs at 6 months was high (≈50%) but not different in the renal denervation and control groups.

Survey of a Protocol to Increase Appropriate Implementation of Dispatcher-Assisted Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Dispatcher-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DA-CPR) attempts to improve the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by laypersons who are unable to recognize cardiac arrest and are unfamiliar with CPR. Therefore, we investigated the sensitivity and specificity of our new DA-CPR protocol for achieving implementation of bystander CPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims not already receiving bystander CPR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Since 2007, we have applied a new DA-CPR protocol that uses supplementary key words. Fire departments prospectively collected baseline data on DA-CPR from January 2009 to December 2011. DA-CPR was attempted in 2747 patients; of these, 417 (15.2%) did not experience cardiac arrest. The sensitivity and specificity of the 2007 protocol versus estimated values of the previous standard protocol were 72.9% versus 50.3% and 99.6% versus 99.8%, respectively. We identified key words that may be useful for detecting out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the occurrence of cardiac arrest after an emergency call (odds ratio, 16.85) and placing an emergency call away from the scene of the arrest (odds ratio, 11.04) were potentially associated with failure to provide DA-CPR. Furthermore, at-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">home</span></strong> cardiac arrest (odds ratio, 1.61) and family members as bystanders (odds ratio, 1.55) were associated with bystander noncompliance with DA-CPR. No complications were reported in the 417 patients who received DA-CPR but did not have cardiac arrest.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Our 2007 protocol is safe and highly specific and may be more sensitive than the standard protocol. Understanding the factors associated with failure of bystanders to provide DA-CPR and implementing public education are necessary to increase the benefit of DA-CPR.</p></sec>

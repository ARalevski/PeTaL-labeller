‘CAMERA’ records cell action with new CRISPR tricks
<p>Biologists long have devised ways to track the inner working of cells, tagging genes with fluorescent proteins and the like to better understand diseases, embryology, and environmental impacts. With the advent of CRISPR, best known as a genome editing tool, many groups have tried to fashion novel recording devices. In a proof-of-concept study published in this week's issue of <i>Science</i>, Harvard University's David Liu and Weixin Tang exploit the components of CRISPR to create two new recording systems that they call a CRISPR-mediated analog multievent recording apparatus, or CAMERA for short. One CAMERA system records with the help of plasmids, circular pieces of DNA that float around bacterial cell cytoplasms. In this scheme, CRISPR kicks into action in response to a stimulus like light, an antibiotic, or a virus, directing the destruction of one of two nearly identical "recorder" plasmids. A tilt in the ratio of recorder one to recorder two captures the exposure to the stimulus, even offering details about the duration and intensity of the exposure. The second CAMERA, which works in mammalian cells as well, uses a CRISPR variant called a base editor to alter the DNA in a "safe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>" gene that can change its sequence without harming the cell. They show how the changes in the safe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong> gene's sequence can record signals from the cellular processes that a stimulus triggers, such as turning on a cancer-causing biochemical pathway.</p>

The Repertoires of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Eukaryotic Genomes
<p>Reversible protein ubiquitination regulates virtually all known cellular activities. Here, we present a quantitatively evaluated and broadly applicable method to predict eukaryotic ubiquitinating enzymes (UBE) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) and its application to 50 distinct genomes belonging to four of the five major phylogenetic supergroups of eukaryotes: unikonts (including metazoans, fungi, choanozoa, and amoebozoa), excavates, chromalveolates, and plants. Our method relies on a collection of profile hidden Markov models, and we demonstrate its superior performance (coverage and classification accuracy >99%) by identifying approximately 25% and approximately 35% additional UBE and DUB genes in yeast and human, which had not been reported before. In yeast, we predict 85 UBE and 24 DUB genes, for 814 UBE and 107 DUB genes in the human genome. Most UBE and DUB families are present in all eukaryotic lineages, with plants and animals <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing massively enlarged repertoires of ubiquitin ligases. Unicellular organisms, on the other hand, typically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong> less than 300 UBEs and less than 40 DUBs per genome. Ninety-one UBE/DUB genes are orthologous across all four eukaryotic supergroups, and these likely represent a primordial core of enzymes of the ubiquitination system probably dating back to the first eukaryotes approximately 2 billion years ago. Our genome-wide predictions are available through the Database of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes (<ext-link>www.DUDE-db.org</ext-link>), where users can also perform advanced sequence and phylogenetic analyses and submit their own predictions.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Cross-species analysis of genetically engineered mouse models of MAPK-driven colorectal cancer identifies hallmarks of the human disease
<p>Effective treatment options for advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) are limited, survival rates are poor and this disease continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Despite being a highly heterogeneous disease, a large subset of individuals with sporadic CRC typically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong> relatively few established ‘driver’ lesions. Here, we describe a collection of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of sporadic CRC that combine lesions frequently altered in human patients, including well-characterized tumor suppressors and activators of MAPK signaling. Primary tumors from these models were profiled, and individual GEMM tumors segregated into groups based on their genotypes. Unique allelic and genotypic expression signatures were generated from these GEMMs and applied to clinically annotated human CRC patient samples. We provide evidence that a <i>Kras</i> signature derived from these GEMMs is capable of distinguishing human tumors <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing <i>KRAS</i> mutation, and tracks with poor prognosis in two independent human patient cohorts. Furthermore, the analysis of a panel of human CRC cell lines suggests that high expression of the GEMM <i>Kras</i> signature correlates with sensitivity to targeted pathway inhibitors. Together, these findings implicate GEMMs as powerful preclinical tools with the capacity to recapitulate relevant human disease biology, and support the use of genetic signatures generated in these models to facilitate future drug discovery and validation efforts.</p>

An algal photoenzyme converts fatty acids to hydrocarbons
<p>Although many organisms capture or respond to sunlight, few enzymes are known to be driven by light. Among these are DNA photolyases and the photosynthetic reaction centers. Here, we show that the microalga <i>Chlorella variabilis</i> NC64A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>s a photoenzyme that acts in lipid metabolism. This enzyme belongs to an algae-specific clade of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family and catalyzes the decarboxylation of free fatty acids to n-alkanes or -alkenes in response to blue light. Crystal structure of the protein reveals a fatty acid–binding site in a hydrophobic tunnel leading to the light-capturing flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor. The decarboxylation is initiated through electron abstraction from the fatty acid by the photoexcited FAD with a quantum yield >80%. This photoenzyme, which we name fatty acid photodecarboxylase, may be useful in light-driven, bio-based production of hydrocarbons.</p>

Highly elastic binders integrating polyrotaxanes for silicon microparticle anodes in lithium ion batteries
<p>Lithium-ion batteries with ever-increasing energy densities are needed for batteries for advanced devices and all-electric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vehicl</span></strong>es. Silicon has been highlighted as a promising anode material because of its superior specific capacity. During repeated charge-discharge cycles, silicon undergoes huge volume changes. This limits cycle life via particle pulverization and an unstable electrode-electrolyte interface, especially when the particle sizes are in the micrometer range. We show that the incorporation of 5 weight % polyrotaxane to conventional polyacrylic acid binder imparts extraordinary elasticity to the polymer network originating from the ring sliding motion of polyrotaxane. This binder combination keeps even pulverized silicon particles coalesced without disintegration, enabling stable cycle life for silicon microparticle anodes at commercial-level areal capacities.</p>

Citywide effects of high-occupancy vehicle restrictions: Evidence from “three-in-one” in Jakarta
<p>Widespread use of single-occupancy cars often leads to traffic congestion. Using anonymized traffic speed data from Android phones collected through Google Maps, we investigated whether high-occupancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vehicl</span></strong>e (HOV) policies can combat congestion. We studied Jakarta’s “three-in-one” policy, which required all private cars on two major roads to carry at least three passengers during peak hours. After the policy was abruptly abandoned in April 2016, delays rose from 2.1 to 3.1 minutes per kilometer (min/km) in the morning peak and from 2.8 to 5.3 min/km in the evening peak. The lifting of the policy led to worse traffic throughout the city, even on roads that had never been restricted or at times when restrictions had never been in place. In short, we find that HOV policies can greatly improve traffic conditions.</p>

Cancer bypasses the lymph nodes
<p>“What did the lymph nodes show?” is the question whose answer is apprehensively awaited by every colon cancer patient. Even in the age of molecular medicine, the absence or presence of colon cancer spread to regional lymph nodes remains the strongest predictor of whether surgery has cured the cancer, or whether an individual may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong> occult metastatic disease and thus require adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce the risk of lethal cancer metastases recurring in distant organs (<i>1</i>–<i>3</i>). But is colon cancer spread to lymph nodes a precursor of spread to another organ (e.g., the liver) or rather an indicator of colon cancer cells' metastatic competence? On page 55 of this issue, Naxerova <i>et al.</i> (<i>4</i>) provide molecular evidence that, in many instances, colon cancer metastases in the liver (and possibly other distant organs), originate from distinct clone(s) that differ from the founder(s) of cancer deposits in the lymph nodes.</p>

RNA polymerase motions during promoter melting
<p>All cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs), from those of bacteria to those of man, possess a clamp that can open and close, and it has been assumed that the open RNAP separates promoter DNA strands and then closes to establish a tight grip on the DNA template. Here, we resolve successive motions of the initiating bacterial RNAP by studying real-time signatures of fluorescent reporters placed on RNAP and DNA in the presence of ligands locking the clamp in distinct conformations. We report evidence for an unexpected and obligatory step early in the initiation involving a transient clamp closure as a prerequisite for DNA melting. We also present a 2.6-angstrom crystal structure of a late-initiation intermediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing a rotationally unconstrained downstream DNA duplex within the open RNAP active site cleft. Our findings explain how RNAP thermal motions control the promoter search and drive DNA melting in the absence of external energy sources.</p>

Ephrin B1–mediated repulsion and signaling control germinal center T cell territoriality and function
<p>Follicular T helper (T<sub>FH</sub>) cells orchestrate the germinal center (GC) reaction locally. Local mechanisms regulating their dynamics and helper functions are not well defined. Here we found that GC-expressed ephrin B1 (EFNB1) repulsively inhibited T cell to B cell adhesion and GC T<sub>FH</sub> retention by signaling through T<sub>FH</sub>-expressed EPHB6 receptor. At the same time, EFNB1 promoted interleukin-21 production from GC T<sub>FH</sub> cells by signaling predominantly through EPHB4. Consequently, EFNB1-null GCs were associated with defective production of plasma cells despite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing excessive T<sub>FH</sub> cells. In a competitive GC reaction, EFNB1-deficient B cells more efficiently interacted with T<sub>FH</sub> cells and produced more bone-marrow plasma cells, likely as a result of gaining more contact-dependent help. Our results reveal a contact-dependent repulsive guidance system that controls GC T<sub>FH</sub> dynamics and effector functions locally.</p>

Rechargeable nickel–3D zinc batteries: An energy-dense, safer alternative to lithium-ion

We demonstrate that the three-dimensional (3D) zinc form-factor elevates the performance of nickel–zinc alkaline cells in three fields of use: (i) >90% theoretical depth of discharge (DOD<sub>Zn</sub>) in primary (single-use) cells, (ii) >100 high-rate cycles at 40% DOD<sub>Zn</sub> at lithium-ion–commensurate specific energy, and (iii) the tens of thousands of power-demanding duty cycles required for start-stop microhybrid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vehicl</span></strong>es.</p>

The whole-soil carbon flux in response to warming

The response of whole-soil profiles to warming has not been tested in situ. In a deep warming experiment in mineral soil, we found that CO<sub>2</sub> production from all soil depths increased with 4°C warming; annual soil respiration increased by 34 to 37%. All depths responded to warming with similar temperature sensitivities, driven by decomposition of decadal-aged carbon. Whole-soil warming reveals a larger soil respiration response than many in situ experiments (most of which only warm the surface soil) and models.</p>

An accreting pulsar with extreme properties drives an ultraluminous x-ray source in NGC 5907
<p>Ultraluminous x-ray sources (ULXs) in nearby galaxies shine brighter than any x-ray source in our Galaxy. ULXs are usually modeled as stellar-mass black holes (BHs) accreting at very high rates or intermediate-mass BHs. We present observations showing that NGC 5907 ULX is instead an x-ray accreting neutron star (NS) with a spin period evolving from 1.43 seconds in 2003 to 1.13 seconds in 2014. It has an isotropic peak luminosity of [Formula]1000 times the Eddington limit for a NS at 17.1 megaparsec.

Generation of influenza A viruses as live but replication-incompetent virus vaccines
<p>The conversion of life-threatening viruses into live but avirulent vaccines represents a revolution in vaccinology.

This generated premature termination codon (PTC)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing viruses that exerted full infectivity but were replication-incompetent in conventional cells. Genome-wide optimization of the sites for incorporation of multiple PTCs resulted in highly reproductive and genetically stable progeny viruses in transgenic cells.

The methods presented here may become a general approach for generating live virus vaccines that can be adapted to almost any virus.</p>

The linker histone H1.0 generates epigenetic and functional intratumor heterogeneity
<p>Tumors comprise functionally diverse subpopulations of cells with distinct proliferative potential. Here, we show that dynamic epigenetic states defined by the linker histone H1.0 determine which cells within a tumor can sustain the long-term cancer growth. Numerous cancer types exhibit high inter- and intratumor heterogeneity of H1.0, with H1.0 levels correlating with tumor differentiation status, patient survival, and, at the single-cell level, cancer stem cell markers. Silencing of H1.0 promotes maintenance of self-renewing cells by inducing derepression of megabase-sized gene domains <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing downstream effectors of oncogenic pathways. Self-renewing epigenetic states are not stable, and reexpression of H1.0 in subsets of tumor cells establishes transcriptional programs that restrict cancer cells’ long-term proliferative potential and drive their differentiation.

Biosynthesis of 2-Phenylethanol in Rose Petals Is Linked to the Expression of One Allele of <i>RhPAAS</i>
<p>Floral scent is one of the most important characters in horticultural plants. Roses (<i>Rosa</i> spp.) have been cultivated for their scent since antiquity. However, probably by selecting for cultivars with long vase life, breeders have lost the fragrant character in many modern roses, especially the ones bred for the cut flower market. The genetic inheritance of scent characters has remained elusive so far. In-depth knowledge of this quantitative trait is thus very much needed to breed more fragrant commercial cultivars. Furthermore, rose hybrids <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong> a composite genomic structure, which complexifies quantitative trait studies. To understand rose scent inheritance, we characterized a segregating population from two diploid cultivars, <i>Rosa</i> × <i>hybrida</i> cv H190 and <i>Rosa wichurana</i>, which have contrasting scent profiles. Several quantitative trait loci for the major volatile compounds in this progeny were identified. One among these loci contributing to the production of 2-phenylethanol, responsible for the characteristic odor of rose, was found to be colocalized with a candidate gene belonging to the 2-phenylethanol biosynthesis pathway: the <i>PHENYLACETALDEHYDE SYNTHASE</i> gene <i>RhPAAS</i>. An in-depth allele-specific expression analysis in the progeny demonstrated that only one allele was highly expressed and was responsible for the production of 2-phenylethanol. Unexpectedly, its expression was found to start early during flower development, before the production of the volatile 2-phenylethanol, leading to the accumulation of glycosylated compounds in petals.</p>

Enhancer-Promoter Interaction of <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> Shapes Photoperiod Adaptation
<p>Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a major vegetable fruit grown and consumed worldwide. Modern cultivated tomatoes are derived from their wild relative, <i>Solanum pimpinellifolium</i>, a short-day plant that originated from the Andean region of South America. The molecular underpinnings of the regional adaptation and expansion of domesticated tomato remain largely unclear. In this study, we examined flowering time in wild and cultivated tomatoes under both long-day and short-day conditions. Using quantitative trait locus mapping in a recombinant inbred line population, we identified <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> (<i>SP5G</i>) as a major locus influencing daylength adaptation in tomato. Genetic diversity analysis revealed that the genomic region <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing <i>SP5G</i> shows signatures of a domestication sweep. We found that a 52-bp sequence within the 3′ untranslated region of <i>SP5G</i> is essential for the enhanced expression of this gene, leading to delayed flowering time in tomatoes through a promoter-enhancer interaction that occurs only under long-day conditions. We further demonstrate that the absence of the 52-bp sequence attenuates the promoter-enhancer interaction and reduces <i>SP5G</i> expression in cultivated tomatoes, making their flowering time insensitive to daylength. Our findings demonstrate that cis-regulatory variation at the enhancer region of the <i>SP5G</i> 3′ untranslated region confers reduced photoperiodic response in cultivated tomatoes, uncovering a regulatory mechanism that could potentially be used to manipulate flowering time in tomato through novel biotechnological approaches.</p>

A Cytosolic Triosephosphate Isomerase Is a Key Component in XA3/XA26-Mediated Resistance
<p>Bacterial blight caused by <i>Xanthomonas oryzae</i> pv <i>oryzae</i> (<i>Xoo</i>) causes severe damage to rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) production worldwide. The major disease resistance gene, <i>Xa3/Xa26</i>, confers broad-spectrum and durable resistance to <i>Xoo</i> at both seedling and adult stages. However, the molecular mechanism of the <i>Xa3/Xa26</i>-initiated defense pathway against <i>Xoo</i> is still largely unknown. Here, we show that a triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), OsTPI1.1, is a key component in XA3/XA26-mediated resistance to <i>Xoo</i>. OsTPI1.1 is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Transcriptional suppression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> in plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing <i>Xa3/Xa26</i> largely impaired the XA3/XA26-mediated resistance to <i>Xoo</i>, and constitutive overexpression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> in susceptible rice plants without <i>Xa3/Xa26</i> only slightly decreased the susceptibility to <i>Xoo</i>. Therefore, both XA3/XA26 and OsTPI1.1 are required in XA3/XA26-mediated resistance. We show that OsTPI1.1 participates in the resistance through its enzymatic activity, which was enhanced significantly by its binding with XA3/XA26. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially hydrogen peroxide, accumulated in the OsTPI1.1-overexpressing plants, and suppression of <i>OsTPI1.1</i> decreased ROS accumulation. The changes in ROS are associated with the reduction of NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH, which may act as a redox cofactor to scavenge ROS, leading to reduced resistance to <i>Xoo</i>. These results suggest that OsTPI1.1 modulates ROS production as a resistance mechanism against <i>Xoo</i>.</p>

Flavodiiron-Mediated O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction Links H<sub>2</sub> Production with CO<sub>2</sub> Fixation during the Anaerobic Induction of Photosynthesis

During anaerobic induction of photosynthesis, molecular O<sub>2</sub> is produced at photosystem II, while at the photosystem I acceptor side, the reduction of protons into hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) by the plastidial [FeFe]-hydrogenases primes CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Although the interaction between H<sub>2</sub> production and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation has been studied extensively, their interplay with O<sub>2</sub> produced by photosynthesis has not been considered. By simultaneously measuring gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence, we identified an O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction mechanism that functions during anaerobic dark-to-light transitions and demonstrate that flavodiiron proteins (Flvs) are the major players involved in light-dependent O<sub>2</sub> uptake. We further show that Flv-mediated O<sub>2</sub> uptake is critical for the rapid induction of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation but is not involved in the creation of the micro-oxic niches proposed previously to protect the [FeFe]-hydrogenase from O<sub>2</sub>. By studying a mutant lacking both hydrogenases (HYDA1 and HYDA2) and both Flvs (FLVA and FLVB), we show that the induction of photosynthesis is strongly delayed in the absence of both sets of proteins. Based on these data, we propose that Flvs are involved in an important intracellular O<sub>2</sub> recycling process, which acts as a relay between H<sub>2</sub> production and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation.</p>

The <i>MicroRNA390</i>/<i>TRANS-ACTING SHORT INTERFERING RNA3</i> Module Mediates Lateral Root Growth under Salt Stress via the Auxin Pathway
<p>Salt-induced developmental plasticity in a plant root system strongly depends on auxin signaling. However, the molecular events underlying this process are poorly understood. <i>MicroRNA390</i> (<i>miR390</i>), <i>trans-actin small interfering RNA</i>s (<i>tasiRNA</i>s), and <i>AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs</i> (<i>ARFs</i>) form a regulatory module involved in controlling lateral root (LR) growth. Here, we found that <i>miR390</i> expression was strongly induced by exposure to salt during LR formation in poplar (<i>Populus</i> spp.) plants. <i>miR390</i> overexpression stimulated LR development and increased salt tolerance, whereas <i>miR390</i> knockdown caused by a short tandem target mimic repressed LR growth and compromised salt resistance. <i>ARF3.1</i>, <i>ARF3.2</i>, and <i>ARF4</i> expression was inhibited significantly by the presence of salt, and transcript abundance was decreased dramatically in the <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing line but increased in the <i>miR390</i>-knockdown line. Constitutive expression of <i>ARF4m</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing mutated <i>trans-acting small interfering ARF</i>-binding sites removed the salt resistance of the <i>miR390</i> overexpressors. <i>miR390</i> positively regulated auxin signaling in LRs subjected to salt, but <i>ARF4</i> inhibited auxin signaling. Salinity stabilized the poplar Aux/IAA repressor INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID17.1, and overexpression of an auxin/salt-resistant form of this repressor suppressed LR growth in <i>miR390</i>-overexpressing and <i>ARF4</i>-RNA interfering lines in the presence of salt. Thus, the <i>miR390/TAS3/ARFs</i> module is a key regulator, via modulating the auxin pathway, of LR growth in poplar subjected to salt stress.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was amplified at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying amplified <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>s four major <i>EPSPS</i> amplified foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene amplification foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into chromosomes. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> amplification events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

The Deubiquitinase OTU5 Regulates Root Responses to Phosphate Starvation
<p>Phosphorus, taken up by plants as inorganic phosphate (Pi), is an essential but often growth-limiting mineral nutrient for plants. As part of an orchestrated response to improve its acquisition, insufficient Pi supply triggers alterations in root architecture and epidermal cell morphogenesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants defective in the expression of the <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) exhibited a constitutive Pi deficiency root phenotype, comprising the formation of long and dense root hairs and attenuated primary root growth. Quantitative protein profiling of <i>otu5</i> and wild-type roots using the isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification methodology revealed genotype- and Pi-dependent alterations in protein profiles. In <i>otu5</i> plants, Pi starvation caused a short-root-hair phenotype and decreased abundance of a suite of Pi-responsive root hair-related proteins. Mutant plants also showed the accumulation of proteins involved in chromatin remodeling and altered distribution of reactive oxygen species along the root, which may be causative for the alterations in root hair morphogenesis. The root hair phenotype of <i>otu5</i> was synergistic to that of <i>actin-related protein6</i> (<i>arp6</i>), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing a mutation in the SWR1 chromatin-remodeling complex. Genetic analysis of <i>otu5/arp6</i> double mutants suggests independent but functionally related roles of the two proteins in chromatin organization. The root hair phenotype of <i>otu5</i> is not caused by a general up-regulation of the Pi starvation response, indicating that OTU5 acts downstream of or interacts with Pi signaling. It is concluded that OTU5 is involved in the interpretation of environmental information, probably by altering chromatin organization and maintaining redox homeostasis.</p>

<i>N</i>-Glycoproteomic Characterization of Mannosidase and Xylosyltransferase Mutant Strains of <i>Chlamydomonas</i> <i>reinhardtii</i>
<p>At present, only little is known about the enzymatic machinery required for <i>N</i>-glycosylation in <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, leading to the formation of <i>N</i>-glycans <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing Xyl and methylated Man. This machinery possesses new enzymatic features, as <i>C. reinhardtii N</i>-glycans are independent of β1,2-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I. Here we have performed comparative <i>N</i>-glycoproteomic analyses of insertional mutants of mannosidase 1A (IM<i><sub>Man1A</sub></i>) and xylosyltransferase 1A (IM<i><sub>XylT1A</sub></i>). The disruption of <i>man1A</i> affected methylation of Man and the addition of terminal Xyl. The absence of XylT1A led to shorter <i>N</i>-glycans compared to the wild type. The use of a IM<i><sub>Man1A</sub></i>xIM<i><sub>XylT1A</sub></i> double mutant revealed that the absence of Man1A suppressed the IM<i><sub>XylT1A</sub></i> phenotype, indicating that the increased <i>N</i>-glycan trimming is regulated by core β1,2-Xyl and is dependent on Man1A activity. These data point toward an enzymatic cascade in the <i>N</i>-glycosylation pathway of <i>C. reinhardtii</i> with interlinked roles of Man1A and XylT1A. The results described herein represent the first step toward a functional characterization of the enzymatic <i>N</i>-glycosylation machinery in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>.</p>

Pollen-Expressed Leucine-Rich Repeat Extensins Are Essential for Pollen Germination and Growth
<p>During pollen tube growth, the walls of the tube provide the mechanical strength resisting turgor pressure to protect two sperm cells. Cell wall proteins may play an important role in this process. Pollen tube cell wall proteins known as leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong> a leucine-rich repeat domain and an extensin domain. In this study, the functions of four pollen-expressed LRXs, LRX8, LRX9, LRX10, and LRX11 (LRX8–11), were characterized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). <i>LRX8–11</i> displayed a consistent expression pattern in mature pollen grains and pollen tubes. In a phenotypic analysis of four single mutants, six double mutants, four triple mutants, and a quadruple mutant, the triple and quadruple mutant plants displayed markedly reduced seed set and decreased male transmission efficiency accompanied by compromised pollen germination and pollen tube growth. GFP-fused LRX8, LRX10, and LRX11 were found to be localized to pollen tube cell walls. An immunohistochemical analysis of pollen tube cell wall polysaccharides showed an increase in the amount of rhamnogalacturonan I in the subapical walls of pollen tubes of the <i>lrx9 lrx10 lrx11</i> and <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutants and a decrease in the content of fucosylated xyloglucans in <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> compared with wild-type plants. Moreover, the callose content in the apical walls of pollen tubes increased in the <i>lrx8 lrx9 lrx11</i> mutant. In conclusion, we propose that LRX8–11 function synergistically to maintain pollen tube cell wall integrity; thus, they play critical roles in pollen germination and pollen tube growth.</p>

Deubiquitinating Enzyme OTU5 Contributes to DNA Methylation Patterns and Is Critical for Phosphate Nutrition Signals
<p>Phosphate (Pi) starvation induces a suite of adaptive responses aimed at recalibrating cellular Pi homeostasis. Plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing a mutation in <i>OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5</i> (<i>OTU5</i>) showed altered DNA methylation of root hair-related genes and altered Pi-responsive root traits. Unlike the wild type, homozygous <i>otu5</i> mutants did not respond to Pi starvation by increased lateral root formation and increased root hair length but formed very short root hairs when grown on low-Pi media. Under Pi-replete conditions, <i>otu5</i> plants developed more root hairs than the wild type due to attenuated primary root growth, a phenotype that resembled that of Pi-deficient plants. Growth of plants on low-Pi media altered both H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation levels at the transcriptional start site of a subset of genes encoding key players in Pi homeostasis, which was correlated with mRNA abundance changes of these genes. Pi starvation had a minor impact on DNA methylation. Differentially methylated regions were enriched in transposable elements, suggesting that DNA methylation associated with low Pi supply is required for maintaining genome integrity. It is concluded that DNA methylation and histone methylation constitute critical, interdependent regulatory components that orchestrate the activity of a subset of Pi-responsive genes.</p>

Selinene Volatiles Are Essential Precursors for Maize Defense Promoting Fungal Pathogen Resistance
<p>To ensure food security, maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) is a model crop for understanding useful traits underlying stress resistance. In contrast to foliar biochemicals, root defenses limiting the spread of disease remain poorly described. To better understand belowground defenses in the field, we performed root metabolomic profiling and uncovered unexpectedly high levels of the sesquiterpene volatile β-selinene and the corresponding nonvolatile antibiotic derivative β-costic acid. The application of metabolite-based quantitative trait locus mapping using biparental populations, genome-wide association studies, and near-isogenic lines enabled the identification of terpene synthase21 (<i>ZmTps21</i>) on chromosome 9 as a β-costic acid pathway candidate gene. Numerous closely examined β-costic acid-deficient inbred lines were found to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong> <i>Zmtps21</i> pseudogenes lacking conserved motifs required for farnesyl diphosphate cyclase activity. For biochemical validation, a full-length <i>ZmTps21</i> was cloned, heterologously expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and demonstrated to cyclize farnesyl diphosphate, yielding β-selinene as the dominant product. Consistent with microbial defense pathways, <i>ZmTps21</i> transcripts strongly accumulate following fungal elicitation. Challenged field roots containing functional <i>ZmTps21</i> alleles displayed β-costic acid levels over 100 μg g<sup>−1</sup> fresh weight, greatly exceeding in vitro concentrations required to inhibit the growth of five different fungal pathogens and rootworm larvae (<i>Diabrotica balteata</i>). In vivo disease resistance assays, using <i>ZmTps21</i> and <i>Zmtps21</i> near-isogenic lines, further support the endogenous antifungal role of selinene-derived metabolites. Involved in the biosynthesis of nonvolatile antibiotics, <i>ZmTps21</i> exists as a useful gene for germplasm improvement programs targeting optimized biotic stress resistance.</p>

Monophyletic Origin and Evolution of the Largest Crucifer Genomes
<p>Clade E, or the <i>Hesperis</i> clade, is one of the major Brassicaceae (Crucifereae) clades, comprising some 48 genera and 351 species classified into seven tribes and is distributed predominantly across arid and montane regions of Asia. Several taxa have socioeconomic significance, being important ornamental but also weedy and invasive species. From the comparative genomic perspective, the clade is noteworthy as it <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>s species with the largest crucifer genomes but low numbers of chromosomes (<i>n</i> = 5–7). By applying comparative cytogenetic analysis and whole-chloroplast phylogenetics, we constructed, to our knowledge, the first partial and complete cytogenetic maps for selected representatives of clade E tribes and investigated their relation<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ship</span></strong>s in a family-wide context. The <i>Hesperis</i> clade is a well-supported monophyletic lineage comprising seven tribes: Anchonieae, Buniadeae, Chorisporeae, Dontostemoneae, Euclidieae, Hesperideae, and Shehbazieae. The clade diverged from other Brassicaceae crown-group clades during the Oligocene, followed by subsequent Miocene tribal diversifications in central/southwestern Asia. The inferred ancestral karyotype of clade E (CEK; <i>n</i> = 7) originated from an older <i>n</i> = 8 genome, which also was the purported progenitor of tribe Arabideae (KAA genome). In most taxa of clade E, the seven linkage groups of CEK either remained conserved (Chorisporeae) or were reshuffled by chromosomal translocations (Euclidieae). In 50% of Anchonieae and Hesperideae species, the CEK genome has undergone descending dysploidy toward <i>n</i> = 6 (−5). These genomic data elucidate early genome evolution in Brassicaceae and pave the way for future whole-genome sequencing and assembly efforts in this as yet genomically neglected group of crucifer plants.</p>

NADPH Thioredoxin Reductase C and Thioredoxins Act Concertedly in Seedling Development
<p>Thiol-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity plays a central role in the rapid acclimation of chloroplast metabolism to ever-fluctuating light availability. This regulatory mechanism relies on ferredoxin reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which fuels reducing power to thioredoxins (Trxs) via a ferredoxin-dependent Trx reductase. In addition, chloroplasts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong> an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase, which has a joint Trx domain at the carboxyl terminus, termed NTRC. Thus, a relevant issue concerning chloroplast function is to establish the relation<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ship</span></strong> between these two redox systems and its impact on plant development. To address this issue, we generated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants combining the deficiency of NTRC with those of Trxs <i>f</i>, which participate in metabolic redox regulation, and that of Trx <i>x</i>, which has antioxidant function. The <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and, to a lower extent, <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed severe growth-retarded phenotypes, decreased photosynthesis performance, and almost abolished light-dependent reduction of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Moreover, the combined deficiency of both redox systems provokes aberrant chloroplast ultrastructure. Remarkably, both the <i>ntrc-trxf1f2</i> and <i>ntrc-trxx</i> mutants showed high mortality at the seedling stage, which was overcome by the addition of an exogenous carbon source. Based on these results, we propose that NTRC plays a pivotal role in chloroplast redox regulation, being necessary for the activity of diverse Trxs with unrelated functions. The interaction between the two thiol redox systems is indispensable to sustain photosynthesis performed by cotyledons chloroplasts, which is essential for early plant development.</p>

Starch Synthase 4 and Plastidal Phosphorylase Differentially Affect Starch Granule Number and Morphology
<p>The process of starch granule formation in leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is obscure. Besides STARCH SYNTHASE4 (SS4), the PLASTIDIAL PHOSPHORYLASE (PHS1) also seems to be involved, since <i>dpe2-1/phs1a</i> double mutants lacking both PHS1 and the cytosolic DISPROPORTIONATING ENZYME2 (DPE2) displayed only one starch granule per chloroplast under normal growth conditions. For further studies, a <i>dpe2-1/phs1a/ss4</i> triple mutant and various combinations of double mutants were generated and metabolically analyzed with a focus on starch metabolism. The <i>dpe2-1/phs1a/ss4</i> mutant revealed a massive starch excess phenotype. Furthermore, these plants grown under 12 h of light/12 h of dark <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ed a single large and spherical starch granule per plastid. The number of starch granules was constant when the light/dark regime was altered, but this was not observed in the parental lines. With regard to growth, photosynthetic parameters, and metabolic analyses, the triple mutant additionally displayed alterations in comparison with <i>ss4</i> and <i>dpe2-1/phs1a</i>. The results clearly illustrate that PHS1 and SS4 are differently involved in starch granule formation and do not act in series. However, SS4 appears to exert a stronger influence. In connection with the characterized double mutants, we discuss the generation of starch granules and the observed formation of spherical starch granules.</p>

Physical Mapping of Amplified Copies of the 5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-Phosphate Synthase Gene in Glyphosate-Resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Recent and rapid evolution of resistance to glyphosate, the most widely used herbicides, in several weed species, including common waterhemp (<i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>), poses a serious threat to sustained crop production. We report that glyphosate resistance in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> was due to amplification of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-P synthase (<i>EPSPS</i>) gene, which encodes the molecular target of glyphosate. There was a positive correlation between <i>EPSPS</i> gene copies and its transcript expression. We analyzed the distribution of <i>EPSPS</i> copies in the genome of <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i> using fluorescence in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphase chromosomes and interphase nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis mapped the <i>EPSPS</i> gene to pericentromeric regions of two homologous chromosomes in glyphosate sensitive <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>. In glyphosate-resistant plants, a cluster of <i>EPSPS</i> genes on the pericentromeric region on one pair of homologous chromosomes was detected. Intriguingly, two highly glyphosate-resistant plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ed an additional chromosome with several <i>EPSPS</i> copies besides the native chromosome pair with <i>EPSPS</i> copies. These results suggest that the initial event of <i>EPSPS</i> gene duplication may have occurred because of unequal recombination mediated by repetitive DNA. Subsequently, gene amplification may have resulted via several other mechanisms, such as chromosomal rearrangements, deletion/insertion, transposon-mediated dispersion, or possibly by interspecific hybridization. This report illustrates the physical mapping of amplified <i>EPSPS</i> copies in <i>A</i>. <i>tuberculatus</i>.</p>

Transcriptional Gene Silencing Maintained by OTS1 SUMO Protease Requires a DNA-Dependent Polymerase V-Dependent Pathway
<p>The expression of genes with aberrant structure is prevented at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation levels. Aberrant gene silencing at the posttranscriptional level is well studied; however, it is not well understood how aberrant genes are silenced at the transcriptional level. In this study, through genetic screening a transgenic report line that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>s an aberrant gene (<i>35S-LUC</i>, lacking 3′-untranslated region [3′-UTR]) and lacks luciferase (LUC) activity, we identify that the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protease <i>OTS1</i> gene is required for maintaining the silence of the reporter <i>35S-LUC</i> and an endogenous mutator-like element <i>MULE-F19G14</i> at the transcriptional level, which requires DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) V and DDR complex, but not Pol IV. The increased transcripts in <i>ots1</i> mutants are terminated by the 3′-UTRs of downstream genes. In addition to <i>ots1</i> mutations, mutations in several known or putative SUMO proteases and two SUMO E3 ligases, <i>SIZ1</i> and <i>MMS21</i>, have similar effects on this silencing regulation. Taken together, our results reveal that the enzymes involved in the SUMOylation process restrain aberrant gene transcription by using a downstream gene 3′-UTR, and this regulation requires a functional Pol V-dependent pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).</p>

VPS36-Dependent Multivesicular Bodies Are Critical for Plasmamembrane Protein Turnover and Vacuolar Biogenesis
<p>Most eukaryotic cells target ubiquitinated plasma membrane (PM) proteins for vacuolar degradation in response to environmental and developmental cues. This process involves endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT). However, little is known about the cellular mechanisms of ESCRTs in plants. Here, we studied the function of one ESCRT-II component, VPS36, which shows ubiquitin-binding activity and may form a putative ESCRT-II with VPS22 and VPS25 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Recessive mutation of the ubiquitously expressed <i>VPS36</i> causes multiple defects, including delayed embryogenesis, defective root elongation, and limited expansion of cotyledons, and these effects can be complemented by its genomic DNA. Abnormal intracellular compartments containing several membrane transporters, including members of the PIN-FORMEDs, AUXIN RESISTANT 1, and PIP1 families, were found in <i>vps36-1</i> plants. Employing a genetic approach to cross <i>vps36-1/+</i> with transgenic plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing various fluorescent protein-tagged organelle markers, as well as fluorescent probe and ultrastructural approaches, revealed PM proteins in microsomal fractions from <i>vps36-1</i> seedlings and demonstrated that VPS36 is critical for forming multivesicular bodies and vacuolar biogenesis for protein degradation. Our study shows that functional VPS36 is essential for a proper endosomal sorting pathway and for vacuolar biogenesis in Arabidopsis.</p>

Phosphorylation of GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 Alters Stimulation of Mg Chelatase Activity in Angiosperms
<p>GENOMES UNCOUPLED 4 (GUN4) is a positive regulator of light-dependent chlorophyll biosynthesis. GUN4 activates Mg chelatase (MgCh) that catalyzes the insertion of an Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion into protoporphyrin IX. We show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GUN4 is phosphorylated at Ser 264 (S264), the penultimate amino acid residue at the C terminus. While GUN4 is preferentially phosphorylated in darkness, phosphorylation is reduced upon accumulation of Mg porphyrins. Expression of a phosphomimicking <i>GUN4</i>(S264D) results in an incomplete complementation of the white <i>gun4-2 null</i> mutant and a chlorotic phenotype comparable to <i>gun4</i> knockdown mutants. Phosphorylated GUN4 has a reduced stimulatory effect on MgCh in vitro and in vivo but retains its protein stability and tetrapyrrole binding capacity. Analysis of GUN4 found in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms reveals the evolution of a C-terminal extension, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>s the phosphorylation site of GUN4 expressed in angiosperms. Homologs of GUN4 from <i>Synechocystis</i> and <i>Chlamydomonas</i> lack the conserved phosphorylation site found in a C-terminal extension of angiosperm GUN4. Biochemical studies proved the importance of the C-terminal extension for MgCh stimulation and inactivation of GUN4 by phosphorylation in angiosperms. An additional mechanism regulating MgCh activity is proposed. In conjunction with the dark repression of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis, GUN4 phosphorylation minimizes the flow of intermediates into the Mg branch of the tetrapyrrole metabolic pathway for chlorophyll biosynthesis.</p>

Genomic Basis of Adaptive Evolution: The Survival of Amur Ide (<i>Leuciscu</i>s <i>waleckii</i>) in an Extremely Alkaline Environment
<p>The Amur ide (<i>Leuciscus waleckii</i>) is a cyprinid fish that is widely distributed in Northeast Asia. The Lake Dali Nur population inhabits one of the most extreme aquatic environments on Earth, with an alkalinity up to 50 mmol/L (pH 9.6), thus providing an exceptional model with which to characterize the mechanisms of genomic evolution underlying adaptation to extreme environments. Here, we developed the reference genome assembly for <i>L. waleckii</i> from Lake Dali Nur. Intriguingly, we identified unusual expanded long terminal repeats (LTRs) with higher nucleotide substitution rates than in many other teleosts, suggesting their more recent insertion into the <i>L. waleckii</i> genome. We also identified expansions in genes encoding egg coat proteins and natriuretic peptide receptors, possibly underlying the adaptation to extreme environmental stress. We further sequenced the genomes of 10 additional individuals from freshwater and 18 from Lake Dali Nur populations, and we detected a total of 7.6 million SNPs from both populations. In a genome scan and comparison of these two populations, we identified a set of genomic regions under selective sweeps that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong> genes involved in ion homoeostasis, acid-base regulation, unfolded protein response, reactive oxygen species elimination, and urea excretion.

Unusual Diversity of Myoglobin Genes in the Lungfish
<p>Myoglobin is a respiratory protein that serves as a model system in a variety of biological fields. Its main function is to deliver and store O<sub>2</sub> in the heart and skeletal muscles, but myoglobin is also instrumental in homeostasis of nitric oxide (NO) and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Almost every vertebrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>s a single myoglobin gene; only some cyprinid fishes have two recently duplicated myoglobin genes. Here we show that the West African lungfish <i>Protopterus annectens</i> has at least seven distinct myoglobin genes (<i>PanMb1–7</i>), which diverged early in the evolution of lungfish and showed an enhanced evolutionary rate. These myoglobins are lungfish specific, and no other globin gene was found amplified. The myoglobins are differentially expressed in various lungfish tissues, and the brain is the main site of myoglobin expression. The typical myoglobin-containing tissues, the skeletal muscle and the heart, have much lower myoglobin mRNA levels. Muscle and heart express distinct myoglobins (<i>PanMb1</i> and <i>PanMb3</i>, respectively). In cell culture, lungfish myoglobins improved cellular survival under hypoxia albeit with different efficiencies and reduced the production of reactive oxygen species. Only <i>Mb2</i> and <i>Mb6</i> enhanced the energy status of the cells. The unexpected diversity of myoglobin hints to a functional diversification of this gene: some myoglobins may have adapted to the O<sub>2</sub> requirements of the specific tissue and help the lungfish to survive hypoxic periods; other myoglobins may have taken over the roles of neuroglobin and cytoglobin, which appear to be missing in the West African lungfish.</p>

A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe injuries. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

Contribution of Impaired Parasympathetic Activity to Right Ventricular Dysfunction and Pulmonary Vascular Remodeling in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The beneficial effects of parasympathetic stimulation have been reported in left heart failure, but whether it would be beneficial for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains to be explored. Here, we investigated the relation<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">ship</span></strong> between parasympathetic activity and right ventricular (RV) function in patients with PAH, and the potential therapeutic effects of pyridostigmine (PYR), an oral drug stimulating the parasympathetic activity through acetylcholinesterase inhibition, in experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Heart rate recovery after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test was used as a surrogate for parasympathetic activity. RV ejection fraction was assessed in 112 patients with PAH. Expression of nicotinic (α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor) and muscarinic (muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor) receptors, and acetylcholinesterase activity were evaluated in RV (n=11) and lungs (n=7) from patients with PAH undergoing heart/lung transplantation and compared with tissue obtained from controls. In addition, we investigated the effects of PYR (40 mg/kg per day) in experimental PH. PH was induced in male rats by SU5416 (25 mg/kg subcutaneously) injection followed by 4 weeks of hypoxia. In a subgroup, sympathetic/parasympathetic modulation was assessed by power spectral analysis. At week 6, PH status was confirmed by echocardiography, and rats were randomly assigned to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vehicl</span></strong>e or treatment (both n=12). At the end of the study, echocardiography was repeated, with additional RV pressure-volume measurements, along with lung, RV histological, and protein analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Patients with PAH with lower RV ejection fraction (<41%) had a significantly reduced heart rate recovery in comparison with patients with higher RV ejection fraction. In PAH RV samples, α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was increased and acetylcholinesterase activity was reduced versus controls. No difference in muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression was observed. Chronic PYR treatment in PH rats normalized the cardiovascular autonomic function, demonstrated by an increase in parasympathetic activity and baroreflex sensitivity. PYR improved survival, increased RV contractility, and reduced RV stiffness, RV hypertrophy, RV fibrosis, RV inflammation, and RV α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and muscarinic acetylcholine type 2 receptor expression, as well. Furthermore, PYR reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, RV afterload, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, which was associated with reduced local and systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>RV dysfunction is associated with reduced systemic parasympathetic activity in patients with PAH, with an inadequate adaptive response of the cholinergic system in the RV. Enhancing parasympathetic activity by PYR improved survival, RV function, and pulmonary vascular remodeling in experimental PH.</p></sec>

Inhibition of JAK-STAT Signaling Suppresses Pathogenic Immune Responses in Medium and Large Vessel Vasculitis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Giant cell arteritis, a chronic autoimmune disease of the aorta and its large branches, is complicated by aneurysm formation, dissection, and arterial occlusions. Arterial wall dendritic cells attract CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages to form prototypic granulomatous infiltrates. Vasculitic lesions contain a diverse array of effector T cells that persist despite corticosteroid therapy and sustain chronic, smoldering vasculitis. Transmural inflammation induces microvascular neoangiogenesis and results in lumen-occlusive intimal hyperplasia. We have examined whether persistent vessel wall inflammation is maintained by lesional T cells, including the newly identified tissue-resident memory T cells, and whether such T cells are sensitive to the cytokine-signaling inhibitor tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor targeting JAK3 and JAK1.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Vascular inflammation was induced in human arteries engrafted into immunodeficient mice that were reconstituted with T cells and monocytes from patients with giant cell arteritis. Mice carrying inflamed human arteries were treated with tofacitinib or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vehicl</span></strong>e. Vasculitic arteries were examined for gene expression (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), protein expression (immunohistochemistry), and infiltrating cell populations (flow cytometry).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Tofacitinib effectively suppressed innate and adaptive immunity in the vessel wall. Lesional T cells responded to tofacitinib with reduced proliferation rates (<10%) and minimal production of the effector molecules interferon-γ, interleukin-17, and interleukin-21. Tofacitinib disrupted adventitial microvascular angiogenesis, reduced outgrowth of hyperplastic intima, and minimized CD4<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident memory T cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Cytokine signaling dependent on JAK3 and JAK1 is critically important in chronic inflammation of medium and large arteries. The JAK inhibitor tofacitinib effectively suppresses tissue-resident memory T cells and inhibits core vasculitogenic effector pathways.</p></sec>

Exosomal MicroRNA Transfer Into Macrophages Mediates Cellular Postconditioning
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) confer cardioprotection in acute myocardial infarction by distinctive macrophage (Mϕ) polarization. Here we demonstrate that CDC-secreted exosomes (CDC<sub>exo</sub>) recapitulate the cardioprotective effects of CDC therapy known as cellular postconditioning.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rats and pigs underwent myocardial infarction induced by ischemia/reperfusion before intracoronary infusion of CDC<sub>exo</sub>, inert fibroblast exosomes (Fb<sub>exo</sub>; control), or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vehicl</span></strong>e. Two days later, infarct size was quantified. Macrophages were isolated from cardiac tissue or bone marrow for downstream analyses. RNA sequencing was used to determine exosome content and alterations in gene expression profiles in Mϕ.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Administration of CDC<sub>exo</sub> but not Fb<sub>exo</sub> after reperfusion reduces infarct size in rat and pig models of myocardial infarction. Furthermore, CDC<sub>exo</sub> reduce the number of CD68+ Mϕ within infarcted tissue and modify the polarization state of Mϕ so as to mimic that induced by CDCs. CDC<sub>exo</sub> are enriched in several miRNAs (including miR-146a, miR-181b, and miR-126) relative to Fb<sub>exo</sub>. Reverse pathway analysis of whole-transcriptome data from CDC<sub>exo</sub>-primed Mϕ implicated miR-181b as a significant (<i>P</i>=1.3x10<sup>−21</sup>) candidate mediator of CDC-induced Mϕ polarization, and PKCδ (protein kinase C δ) as a downstream target. Otherwise inert Fb<sub>exo</sub> loaded selectively with miR-181b alter Mϕ phenotype and confer cardioprotective efficacy in a rat model of myocardial infarction. Adoptive transfer of PKCδ-suppressed Mϕ recapitulates cardioprotection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data support the hypothesis that exosomal transfer of miR-181b from CDCs into Mϕ reduces PKCδ transcript levels and underlies the cardioprotective effects of CDCs administered after reperfusion.</p></sec>

Stress-Activated Kinase Mitogen-Activated Kinase Kinase-7 Governs Epigenetics of Cardiac Repolarization for Arrhythmia Prevention
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ventricular arrhythmia is a leading cause of cardiac mortality. Most antiarrhythmics present paradoxical proarrhythmic side effects, culminating in a greater risk of sudden death.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We describe a new regulatory mechanism linking mitogen-activated kinase kinase-7 deficiency with increased arrhythmia vulnerability in hypertrophied and failing hearts using mouse models <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ing mitogen-activated kinase kinase-7 knockout or overexpression. The human relevance of this arrhythmogenic mechanism is evaluated in human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes. Therapeutic potentials by targeting this mechanism are explored in the mouse models and human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Mechanistically, hypertrophic stress dampens expression and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated kinase kinase-7. Such mitogen-activated kinase kinase-7 deficiency leaves histone deacetylase-2 unphosphorylated and filamin-A accumulated in the nucleus to form a complex with Krüppel-like factor-4. This complex leads to Krüppel-like factor-4 disassociation from the promoter regions of multiple key potassium channel genes (Kv4.2, KChIP2, Kv1.5, ERG1, and Kir6.2) and reduction of their transcript levels. Consequent repolarization delays result in ventricular arrhythmias. Therapeutically, targeting the repressive function of the Krüppel-like factor-4/histone deacetylase-2/filamin-A complex with the histone deacetylase-2 inhibitor valproic acid restores K<sup>+</sup> channel expression and alleviates ventricular arrhythmias in pathologically remodeled hearts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings unveil this new gene regulatory avenue as a new antiarrhythmic target where repurposing of the antiepileptic drug valproic acid as an antiarrhythmic is supported.</p></sec>

Loss of Endothelial CXCR7 Impairs Vascular Homeostasis and Cardiac Remodeling After Myocardial Infarction
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Genome-wide association studies identified the association of the <i>CXCL12</i> genetic locus (which encodes the chemokine CXCL12, also known as stromal cell–derived factor 1) with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (MI). Unlike CXCR4, the classic receptor for CXCL12, the function of CXCR7 (the most recently identified receptor) in vascular responses to injury and in MI remains unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Tissue expression of CXCR7 was examined in arteries from mice and humans. Mice that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">harbor</span></strong>ed floxed <i>CXCR7</i> and <i>Cdh5</i>-promoter driven <i>CreERT2</i> were treated with tamoxifen to induce endothelium-restricted deletion of CXCR7. The resulting conditional knockout mice and littermate controls were studied for arterial response to angioplasty wire injury and cardiac response to coronary artery ligation. The role of CXCR7 in endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis was determined in vitro with cells from mice and humans. The effects of adenoviral delivery of <i>CXCR7</i> gene and pharmacological activation of CXCR7 were evaluated in mice subjected to MI.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Injured arteries from both humans and mice exhibited endothelial CXCR7 expression. Conditional endothelial CXCR7 deletion promoted neointimal formation without altering plasma lipid levels after endothelial injury and exacerbated heart functional impairment after MI, with increased both mortality and infarct sizes. Mechanistically, the exacerbated responses in vascular and cardiac remodeling are attributable to the key role of CXCR7 in promoting endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. Impressively, the impaired post-MI cardiac remodeling occurred with elevated levels of CXCL12, which was previously thought to mediate cardiac protection by exclusively engaging its cognate receptor, CXCR4. In addition, both <i>CXCR7</i> gene delivery via left ventricular injection and treatment with a CXCR7 agonist offered cardiac protection after MI.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CXCR7 represents a novel regulator of vascular homeostasis that functions in the endothelial compartment with sufficient capacity to affect cardiac function and remodeling after MI. Activation of CXCR7 may have therapeutic potential for clinical restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention and for heart remodeling after MI.</p></sec>

NLRP3 Inflammasome Mediates Aldosterone-Induced Vascular Damage
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Inflammation is a key feature of aldosterone-induced vascular damage and dysfunction, but molecular mechanisms by which aldosterone triggers inflammation remain unclear. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a pivotal immune sensor that recognizes endogenous danger signals triggering sterile inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed vascular function and inflammatory profile of wild-type (WT), NLRP3 knockout (<i>NLRP3</i><sup>−/−</sup>), caspase-1 knockout (<i>Casp-1</i><sup>−/−</sup>), and interleukin-1 receptor knockout (<i>IL-1R</i><sup>−/−</sup>) mice treated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vehicl</span></strong>e or aldosterone (600 µg·kg<sup>−1</sup>·d<sup>−1</sup> for 14 days through osmotic mini-pump) while receiving 1% saline to drink.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Here, we show that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a central role in aldosterone-induced vascular dysfunction. Long-term infusion of aldosterone in mice resulted in elevation of plasma interleukin-1β levels and vascular abnormalities. Mice lacking the IL-1R or the inflammasome components NLRP3 and caspase-1 were protected from aldosterone-induced vascular damage. In vitro, aldosterone stimulated NLRP3-dependent interleukin-1β secretion by bone marrow–derived macrophages by activating nuclear factor-κB signaling and reactive oxygen species generation. Moreover, chimeric mice reconstituted with NLRP3-deficient hematopoietic cells showed that NLRP3 in immune cells mediates aldosterone-induced vascular damage. In addition, aldosterone increased the expression of NLRP3, active caspase-1, and mature interleukin-1β in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Hypertensive patients with hyperaldosteronism or normal levels of aldosterone exhibited increased activity of NLRP3 inflammasome, suggesting that the effect of hyperaldosteronism on the inflammasome may be mediated through high blood pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Together, these data demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome, through activation of IL-1R, is critically involved in the deleterious vascular effects of aldosterone, placing NLRP3 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in conditions with high aldosterone levels.</p></sec>

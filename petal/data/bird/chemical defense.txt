Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

Common Genetic Variant Risk Score Is Associated With Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced QT interval prolongation, a risk factor for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, is a potential side effect of many marketed and withdrawn medications. The contribution of common genetic variants previously associated with baseline QT interval to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced QT prolongation and arrhythmias is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We tested the hypothesis that a weighted combination of common genetic variants contributing to QT interval at baseline, identified through genome-wide association studies, can predict individual response to multiple QT-prolonging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s. Genetic analysis of 22 subjects was performed in a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 3 QT-prolonging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s with 15 time-matched QT and plasma <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> concentration measurements. Subjects received single doses of dofetilide, quinidine, ranolazine, and placebo. The outcome was the correlation between a genetic QT score comprising 61 common genetic variants and the slope of an individual subject’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced increase in heart rate–corrected QT (QTc) versus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The genetic QT score was correlated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced QTc prolongation. Among white subjects, genetic QT score explained 30% of the variability in response to dofetilide (<i>r</i>=0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.81; <i>P</i>=0.02), 23% in response to quinidine (<i>r</i>=0.48; 95% confidence interval, −0.03 to 0.79; <i>P</i>=0.06), and 27% in response to ranolazine (<i>r</i>=0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.05–0.80; <i>P</i>=0.03). Furthermore, the genetic QT score was a significant predictor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced torsade de pointes in an independent sample of 216 cases compared with 771 controls (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>=12%, <i>P</i>=1×10<sup>−7</sup>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We demonstrate that a genetic QT score comprising 61 common genetic variants explains a significant proportion of the variability in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced QT prolongation and is a significant predictor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced torsade de pointes. These findings highlight an opportunity for recent genetic discoveries to improve individualized risk-benefit assessment for pharmacological therapies.

Tuberculosis of the spine with severe angular kyphosis
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>To address the natural history of severe post-tuberculous (TB)   kyphosis, with focus upon the long-term <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical outcome, occurrence   of restrictive lung disease, and the effect on life expectancy. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This is a retrospective clinical review of prospectively collected   imaging data based at a single institute. A total of 24 patients   of Southern Chinese origin who presented with spinal TB with a mean   of 113° of kyphosis (65° to 159°) who fulfilled inclusion criteria   were reviewed. Plain radiographs were used to assess the degree   of spinal deformity. Myelography, CT and MRI were used when available   to assess the integrity of the spinal cord and canal. Patient demographics,   age of onset of spinal TB and interventions, types of surgical procedure,   intra- and post-operative complications, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical status   were assessed. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All except one of the 24 patients were treated with anti-TB chemotherapy   when they were first diagnosed with spinal TB. They subsequently   received surgery either for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical deterioration, or deformity   correction in later life. The mean follow-up was 34 years (11 to   59) since these surgical interventions. Some 16 patients (66.7%) suffered   from late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical deterioration at a mean of 26 years (8 to   49) after the initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> treatment. The causes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical   deterioration were healed disease in nine patients (56.2%),    re-activation in six patients (37.5%) and adjacent level spinal   stenosis in one patient (6.3%). The result of surgery was worse   in healed disease. Eight patients without <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical deterioration   received surgery to correct the kyphosis. The mean correction ranged   from 97° to 72°. Three patients who were clinically quiescent with   no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical deterioration were found to have active TB of the   spine. Solid fusion was achieved in all cases and no patient suffered   from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical deterioration after 42 years of follow-up. On   final follow-up, six patients were noted to have deceased (age range:   47 years to 75 years).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presents one of the longest assessments of spinal TB   with severe kyphosis. Severe post-TB kyphosis may lead to significant   health problems many years following the initial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> treatment.   Early surgical correction of the kyphosis, solid fusion and regular   surveillance may avoid late complications. Paraplegia, restrictive   lung disease and early onset kyphosis might relate to early death.   Clinically quiescent disease does not mean cure. </p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1381–8.</p></sec>

Association Between Early Hyperoxia Exposure After Resuscitation From Cardiac Arrest and Neurological Disability
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Studies examining the association between hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest and clinical outcomes have reported conflicting results. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that early postresuscitation hyperoxia is associated with poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter prospective cohort study. We included adult patients with cardiac arrest who were mechanically ventilated and received targeted temperature management after return of spontaneous circulation. We excluded patients with cardiac arrest caused by trauma or sepsis. Per protocol, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>) was measured at 1 and 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Hyperoxia was defined as a Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> >300 mm Hg during the initial 6 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. The primary outcome was poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical function at hospital discharge, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score >3. Multivariable generalized linear regression with a log link was used to test the association between Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> and poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical outcome. To assess whether there was an association between other supranormal Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> levels and poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical outcome, we used other Pa<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> cut points to define hyperoxia (ie, 100, 150, 200, 250, 350, 400 mm Hg).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of the 280 patients included, 105 (38%) had exposure to hyperoxia. Poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical function at hospital discharge occurred in 70% of patients in the entire cohort and in 77% versus 65% among patients with versus without exposure to hyperoxia respectively (absolute risk difference, 12%; 95% confidence interval, 1–23). Hyperoxia was independently associated with poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical function (relative risk, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.11–1.35). On multivariable analysis, a 1-hour-longer duration of hyperoxia exposure was associated with a 3% increase in risk of poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical outcome (relative risk, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.05). We found that the association with poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical outcome began at ≥300 mm Hg.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Early hyperoxia exposure after resuscitation from cardiac arrest was independently associated with poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical function at hospital discharge.</p></sec>

Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Nonshockable-Turned-Shockable Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) commonly presents with nonshockable rhythms (asystole and pulseless electric activity). It is unknown whether antiarrhythmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s are safe and effective when nonshockable rhythms evolve to shockable rhythms (ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia [VF/VT]) during resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with nontraumatic OHCA, vascular access, and VF/VT anytime after ≥1 shock(s) were prospectively randomized, double-blind, to receive amiodarone, lidocaine, or placebo by paramedics. Patients presenting with initial shock-refractory VF/VT were previously reported. The current study was a prespecified analysis in a separate cohort that initially presented with nonshockable OHCA and was randomized on subsequently developing shock-refractory VF/VT. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes included discharge functional status and adverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-related effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Of 37 889 patients with OHCA, 3026 with initial VF/VT and 1063 with initial nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were treatment-eligible, were randomized, and received their assigned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>. Baseline characteristics among patients with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Active-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> recipients in this cohort required fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>, and ancillary antiarrhythmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s than recipients of a placebo (<i>P</i><0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital discharge (<i>P</i>=0.24). No significant interaction between treatment assignment and discharge survival occurred with the initiating OHCA rhythm (asystole, pulseless electric activity, or VF/VT). Survival in each of these categories was consistently higher with active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s, although the trends were not statistically significant. Adjusted absolute differences (95% confidence interval) in survival from nonshockable-turned-shockable arrhythmias with amiodarone versus placebo were 2.3% (−0.3, 4.8), <i>P</i>=0.08, and for lidocaine versus placebo 1.2% (−1.1, 3.6), <i>P</i>=0.30. More than 50% of these survivors were functionally independent or required minimal assistance. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-related adverse effects were infrequent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Outcome from nonshockable-turned-shockable OHCA is poor but not invariably fatal. Although not statistically significant, point estimates for survival were greater after amiodarone or lidocaine than placebo, without increased risk of adverse effects or disability and consistent with previously observed favorable trends from treatment of initial shock-refractory VF/VT with these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s.

Drug Screening Using a Library of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiomyocytes Reveals Disease-Specific Patterns of Cardiotoxicity
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> attrition during pharmaceutical development and has resulted in numerous preventable patient deaths. Incidents of adverse cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> reactions are more common in patients with preexisting heart disease than the general population. Here we generated a library of human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from patients with various hereditary cardiac disorders to model differences in cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> toxicity susceptibility for patients of different genetic backgrounds.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>Action potential duration and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced arrhythmia were measured at the single cell level in hiPSC-CMs derived from healthy subjects and patients with hereditary long QT syndrome, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and familial dilated cardiomyopathy. Disease phenotypes were verified in long QT syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy hiPSC-CMs by immunostaining and single cell patch clamp. Human embryonic stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) and the human <i>ether-a-go-go</i>–related gene expressing human embryonic kidney cells were used as controls. Single cell PCR confirmed expression of all cardiac ion channels in patient-specific hiPSC-CMs as well as hESC-CMs, but not in human embryonic kidney cells. Disease-specific hiPSC-CMs demonstrated increased susceptibility to known cardiotoxic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s as measured by action potential duration and quantification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced arrhythmias such as early afterdepolarizations and delayed afterdepolarizations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>We have recapitulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-induced cardiotoxicity profiles for healthy subjects, long QT syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy patients at the single cell level for the first time.

A Nanoparticle-Based Combination Chemotherapy Delivery System for Enhanced Tumor Killing by Dynamic Rewiring of Signaling Pathways
<sec><title>Timing the One-Two Punch</title><p>Morton <i>et al</i>. developed a dual-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>, time-delayed nanoparticle delivery system for treating cancer. The nanoparticles contained two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s (one in the membrane and one in the center) and were coated to target the nanoparticles to cancer cells. Cancer cells took up the nanoparticles. The first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> quickly escaped the nanoparticle, sensitizing the cells to the second <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>, which escaped more slowly. In mice, tumors from cells that respond to the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> were reduced when the mice were treated with the dual-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> nanoparticles, but the tumors continued to grow in mice receiving only single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> therapy. This time-delayed, nanoparticle-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> delivery may avoid the resistance that cancer cells develop to chemotherapy.</p></sec>

Separating host and microbiome contributions to drug pharmacokinetics and toxicity
<p>The gut microbiota is implicated in the metabolism of many medical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s, with consequences for interpersonal variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> efficacy and toxicity. However, quantifying microbial contributions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> metabolism is challenging, particularly in cases where host and microbiome perform the same metabolic transformation. We combined gut commensal genetics with gnotobiotics to measure brivudine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> metabolism across tissues in mice that vary in a single microbiome-encoded enzyme. Informed by these measurements, we built a pharmacokinetic model that quantitatively predicts microbiome contributions to systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> and metabolite exposure, as a function of bioavailability, host and microbial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-metabolizing activity, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> and metabolite absorption, and intestinal transit kinetics. Clonazepam studies illustrate how this approach disentangles microbiome contributions to metabolism of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s subject to multiple metabolic routes and transformations.</p>

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver   reproducibility both had substantial agreement, with kappa values   of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a logical, all-inclusive, and mutually exclusive classification   system for fractures of the navicular that gives associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es   involving the lateral column due consideration.

Application of Large-Scale Aptamer-Based Proteomic Profiling to Planned Myocardial Infarctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Emerging proteomic technologies using novel affinity-based reagents allow for efficient multiplexing with high-sample throughput. To identify early biomarkers of myocardial injury, we recently applied an aptamer-based proteomic profiling platform that measures 1129 proteins to samples from patients undergoing septal alcohol ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a human model of planned myocardial injury. Here, we examined the scalability of this approach using a markedly expanded platform to study a far broader range of human proteins in the context of myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a highly multiplexed, expanded proteomic technique that uses single-stranded DNA aptamers to assay 4783 human proteins (4137 distinct human gene targets) to derivation and validation cohorts of planned myocardial injury, individuals with spontaneous myocardial infarction, and at-risk controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found 376 target proteins that significantly changed in the blood after planned myocardial injury in a derivation cohort (n=20; <i>P</i><1.05E-05, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance, Bonferroni threshold). Two hundred forty-seven of these proteins were validated in an independent planned myocardial injury cohort (n=15; <i>P</i><1.33E-04, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance); >90% were directionally consistent and reached nominal significance in the validation cohort. Among the validated proteins that were increased within 1 hour after planned myocardial injury, 29 were also elevated in patients with spontaneous myocardial infarction (n=63; <i>P</i><6.17E-04). Many of the novel markers identified in our study are intracellular proteins not previously identified in the peripheral circulation or have functional roles relevant to myocardial injury. For example, the cardiac LIM protein, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 3, is thought to mediate cardiac mechanotransduction and stress responses, whereas the mitochondrial ATP synthase F<sub>0</sub> subunit component is a vasoactive peptide on its release from cells. Last, we performed aptamer-affinity enrichment coupled with mass spectrometry to technically verify aptamer specificity for a subset of the new biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale aptamer multiplexing at a level that has not previously been reported and with sample throughput that greatly exceeds other existing proteomic methods. The expanded aptamer-based proteomic platform provides a unique opportunity for biomarker and pathway discovery after myocardial injury.</p></sec>

Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction and Myocardial Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are common in clinical practice, but long-term consequences are uncertain. We aimed to define long-term outcomes and explore risk stratification in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified consecutive patients (n=2122) with elevated cardiac troponin I concentrations (≥0.05 µg/L) at a tertiary cardiac center. All diagnoses were adjudicated as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) and noncardiovascular death. To explore competing risks, cause-specific hazard ratios were obtained using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The adjudicated index diagnosis was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively. At 5 years, all-cause death rates were higher in those with type 2 myocardial infarction (62.5%) or myocardial injury (72.4%) compared with type 1 myocardial infarction (36.7%). The majority of excess deaths in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury were because of noncardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.92–2.81 versus type 1 myocardial infarction). Despite this finding, the observed crude major adverse cardiovascular event rates were similar between groups (30.6% versus 32.6%), with differences apparent after adjustment for covariates (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.96). Coronary heart disease was an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in those with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.31–2.24).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Despite an excess in noncardiovascular death, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury have a similar crude rate of major adverse cardiovascular events as those with type 1 myocardial infarction. Identifying underlying coronary heart disease in this vulnerable population may help target therapies that could modify future risk.</p></sec>

Neuroprotective Effects of the Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Analog Exenatide After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In-hospital mortality in comatose patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is ≈50%. In OHCA patients, the leading cause of death is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical injury secondary to ischemia and reperfusion. Glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs are approved for type 2 diabetes mellitus; preclinical and clinical data have suggested their organ-protective effects in patients with ischemia and reperfusion injury. The aim of this trial was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 analog exenatide in resuscitated OHCA patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We randomly assigned 120 consecutive comatose patients resuscitated from OHCA in a double-blind, 2-center trial. They were administered 17.4 μg exenatide (Byetta) or placebo over a 6-hour and 15-minute infusion, in addition to standardized intensive care including targeted temperature management. The coprimary end points were feasibility, defined as initiation of the study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> in >90% patients within 240 minutes of return of spontaneous circulation, and efficacy, defined as the geometric area under the neuron-specific enolase curve from 24 to 72 hours after admission. The main secondary end points included a composite end point of death and poor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical function, defined as a Cerebral Performance Category score of 3 to 5 assessed at 30 and 180 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> was initiated within 240 minutes of return of spontaneous circulation in 96% patients.

The target landscape of clinical kinase drugs
<p>Kinase inhibitors are important cancer therapeutics. Polypharmacology is commonly observed, requiring thorough target deconvolution to understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> mechanism of action. Using chemical proteomics, we analyzed the target spectrum of 243 clinically evaluated kinase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s. The data revealed previously unknown targets for established <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s, offered a perspective on the “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>gable” kinome, highlighted (non)kinase off-targets, and suggested potential therapeutic applications. Integration of phosphoproteomic data refined <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-affected pathways, identified response markers, and strengthened rationale for combination treatments. We exemplify translational value by discovering SIK2 (salt-inducible kinase 2) inhibitors that modulate cytokine production in primary cells, by identifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s against the lung cancer survival marker MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase), and by repurposing cabozantinib to treat FLT3-ITD–positive acute myeloid leukemia. This resource, available via the ProteomicsDB database, should facilitate basic, clinical, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> discovery research and aid clinical decision-making.</p>

Patients were reviewed prospectively at one, two, seven, 15 and   about 20 years after their original surgery.

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Pharmacological preconditioning with erythropoietin attenuates the organ injury and dysfunction induced in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock
<p>Pre-treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) has been demonstrated to exert tissue-protective effects against ‘ischemia-reperfusion’-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es. This protection might be mediated by mobilization of bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are thought to secrete paracrine factors. These effects could be exploited to protect against tissue injury induced in cases where hemorrhage is foreseeable, for example, prior to major surgery. Here, we investigate the effects of EPO pre-treatment on the organ injury and dysfunction induced by hemorrhagic shock (HS). Recombinant human EPO (1000 IU/kg/day i.p.) was administered to rats for 3 days. Rats were subjected to HS on day 4 (pre-treatment protocol). Mean arterial pressure was reduced to 35±5 mmHg for 90 minutes, followed by resuscitation with 20 ml/kg Ringer’s lactate for 10 minutes and 50% of the shed blood for 50 minutes. Rats were sacrificed 4 hours after the onset of resuscitation. EPC (CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cell) mobilization was measured following the 3-day pre-treatment with EPO and was significantly increased compared with rats pre-treated with phosphate-buffered saline. EPO pre-treatment significantly attenuated organ injury and dysfunction (renal, hepatic and neuromuscular) caused by HS. In livers from rats subjected to HS, EPO enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt (activation), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β; inhibition) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; activation). In the liver, HS also caused an increase in nuclear translocation of p65 (activation of NF-κB), which was attenuated by EPO. This data suggests that repetitive dosing with EPO prior to injury might protect against the organ injury and dysfunction induced by HS, by a mechanism that might involve mobilization of CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cells, resulting in the activation of the Akt-eNOS survival pathway and inhibition of activation of GSK-3β and NF-κB.</p>

Restricting mitochondrial GRK2 post-ischemia confers cardioprotection by reducing myocyte death and maintaining glucose oxidation
<p>Increased abundance of GRK2 [G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 2] is associated with poor cardiac function in heart failure patients. In animal models, GRK2 contributes to the pathogenesis of heart failure after ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. In addition to its role in down-regulating activated GPCRs, GRK2 also localizes to mitochondria both basally and post-IR injury, where it regulates cellular metabolism. We previously showed that phosphorylation of GRK2 at Ser<sup>670</sup> is essential for the translocation of GRK2 to the mitochondria of cardiomyocytes post-IR injury in vitro and that this localization promotes cell death. Here, we showed that mice with a S670A knock-in mutation in endogenous GRK2 showed reduced cardiomyocyte death and better cardiac function post-IR injury. Cultured GRK2-S670A knock-in cardiomyocytes subjected to IR in vitro showed enhanced glucose-mediated mitochondrial respiratory function that was partially due to maintenance of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and improved glucose oxidation. Thus, we propose that mitochondrial GRK2 plays a detrimental role in cardiac glucose oxidation post-injury.</p>

Covalent inhibitors of EGFR family protein kinases induce degradation of human Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) pseudokinase in cancer cells
<p>A major challenge associated with biochemical and cellular analysis of pseudokinases is a lack of target-validated small-molecule compounds with which to probe function. Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with a diverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There is substantial evidence that human TRIB2 promotes survival and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> resistance in solid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutic target. The unusual TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-rich C-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminal tail, which also supports its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases. We found that TRIB2 is a target of previously described small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinase domains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Using a thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB2-binding compounds within the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and used a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> repurposing approach to classify compounds that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB2 in vitro. TRIB2 destabilizing agents, including the covalent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> afatinib, led to rapid TRIB2 degradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signaling and survival. Our data reveal new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> leads for the development of TRIB2-degrading compounds, which will also be invaluable for unraveling the cellular mechanisms of TRIB2-based signaling. Our study highlights that small molecule–induced protein down-regulation through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> “off-targets” might be relevant for other inhibitors that serendipitously target pseudokinases.</p>

Developmental phosphoproteomics identifies the kinase CK2 as a driver of Hedgehog signaling and a therapeutic target in medulloblastoma
<p>A major limitation of targeted cancer therapy is the rapid emergence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> resistance, which often arises through mutations at or downstream of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> target or through intrinsic resistance of subpopulations of tumor cells. Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common pediatric brain tumor, is no exception, and MBs that are driven by sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling are particularly aggressive and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-resistant. To find new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> targets and therapeutics for MB that may be less susceptible to common resistance mechanisms, we used a developmental phosphoproteomics approach in murine granule neuron precursors (GNPs), the developmental cell of origin of MB. The protein kinase CK2 emerged as a driver of hundreds of phosphorylation events during the proliferative, MB-like stage of GNP growth, including the phosphorylation of three of the eight proteins commonly amplified in MB. CK2 was critical to the stabilization and activity of the transcription factor GLI2, a late downstream effector in SHH signaling. CK2 inhibitors decreased the viability of primary SHH-type MB patient cells in culture and blocked the growth of murine MB tumors that were resistant to currently available Hh inhibitors, thereby extending the survival of tumor-bearing mice. Because of structural interactions, one CK2 inhibitor (CX-4945) inhibited both wild-type and mutant CK2, indicating that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> may avoid at least one common mode of acquired resistance. These findings suggest that CK2 inhibitors may be effective for treating patients with MB and show how phosphoproteomics may be used to gain insight into developmental biology and pathology.</p>

Supporting recovery from brain injury
<p>The beauty and intricacy of the human brain is unfortunately also mirrored by its vulnerability. Damage to the brain is typically permanent. Because cells of the adult brain, apart from rare exceptions, no longer divide, there is essentially no regrowth of damaged brain tissue. Acquired brain injury in the majority of cases occurs directly through traumatic events such as an accident involving a blow to the head or indirectly through interruption of the blood supply, namely a stroke. Brain injury is a major burden, with an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffering a traumatic brain injury and nearly 800,000 Americans suffering a stroke each year (<i>1</i>, <i>2</i>). However, current treatment options for such brain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es are still limited and are focused on the first hours after the insult. On page 50 of this issue, Abe <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) describe a new approach in mouse and primate models that aims to enhance the ability of the brain to regain functionality in the days and weeks after brain injury.</p>

Extracellular Matrix Proteomics Reveals Interplay of Aggrecan and Aggrecanases in Vascular Remodeling of Stented Coronary Arteries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling contributes to in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Despite its important clinical implications, little is known about ECM changes post–stent implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Bare-metal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-eluting stents were implanted in pig coronary arteries with an overstretch under optical coherence tomography guidance. Stented segments were harvested 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days post-stenting for proteomics analysis of the media and neointima.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 151 ECM and ECM-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. After stent implantation, proteins involved in regulating calcification were upregulated in the neointima of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-eluting stents. The earliest changes in the media were proteins involved in inflammation and thrombosis, followed by changes in regulatory ECM proteins. By day 28, basement membrane proteins were reduced in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-eluting stents in comparison with bare-metal stents. In contrast, the large aggregating proteoglycan aggrecan was increased. Aggrecanases of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) family contribute to the catabolism of vascular proteoglycans. An increase in ADAMTS-specific aggrecan fragments was accompanied by a notable shift from <i>ADAMTS1</i> and <i>ADAMTS5</i> to <i>ADAMTS4</i> gene expression after stent implantation. Immunostaining in human stented coronary arteries confirmed the presence of aggrecan and aggrecan fragments, in particular, at the contacts of the stent struts with the artery. Further investigation of aggrecan presence in the human vasculature revealed that aggrecan and aggrecan cleavage were more abundant in human arteries than in human veins. In addition, aggrecan synthesis was induced on grafting a vein into the arterial circulation, suggesting an important role for aggrecan in vascular plasticity. Finally, lack of ADAMTS-5 activity in mice resulted in an accumulation of aggrecan and a dilation of the thoracic aorta, confirming that aggrecanase activity regulates aggrecan abundance in the arterial wall and contributes to vascular remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Significant differences were identified by proteomics in the ECM of coronary arteries after bare-metal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-eluting stent implantation, most notably an upregulation of aggrecan, a major ECM component of cartilaginous tissues that confers resistance to compression. The accumulation of aggrecan coincided with a shift in <i>ADAMTS</i> gene expression. This study provides the first evidence implicating aggrecan and aggrecanases in the vascular injury response after stenting.</p></sec>

Functional Metabolomics Characterizes a Key Role for <i>N</i>-Acetylneuraminic Acid in Coronary Artery Diseases
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>As new biomarkers of coronary artery diseases (CAD) emerge via metabolomics, the underlying functional mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Functional metabolomics aims to translate metabolomics-derived biomarkers to disease mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A cohort of 2324 patients who underwent coronary angiography from 4 independent centers was studied. A combination of ultra–performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode was used for untargeted analysis of metabolites in plasma. Significant differential metabolites were identified by cross-comparisons with and within CAD types, including normal coronary artery, nonobstructvie coronary atherosclerosis, stable angina, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction. A tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry–based approach using isotope-labeled standard addition was subsequently performed for targeted analysis of the metabolic marker <i>N</i>-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). A functional metabolomics strategy was proposed to investigate the role of Neu5Ac in the progression of CAD by using in vitro and in vivo models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified a total of 36 differential metabolites, 35 of which were confirmed with reference compounds. Elevation of Neu5Ac was observed in plasma during CAD progression in center 1 (<i>P</i>=4.0e-64, n=2019) and replicated in 3 independent centers (n=305). The increased level of Neu5Ac in plasma was confirmed by accurate targeted quantification. Mechanistically, Neu5Ac was able to trigger myocardial injury in vitro and in vivo by activation of the Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase signaling pathway through binding to RhoA and Cdc42, but not Rac1. Silencing neuraminidase-1, the enzyme that regulates Neu5Ac generation, ameliorated oxygen-glucose deprivation–induced injury in cardiomyocytes and ligation/isoprenaline-induced myocardial ischemia injury in rats.

Fibroblast-Specific Genetic Manipulation of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase In Vivo Reveals Its Central Regulatory Role in Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the heart, acute injury induces a fibrotic healing response that generates collagen-rich scarring that is at first protective but if inappropriately sustained can worsen heart disease. The fibrotic process is initiated by cytokines, neuroendocrine effectors, and mechanical strain that promote resident fibroblast differentiation into contractile and extracellular matrix–producing myofibroblasts. The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α (<i>Mapk14</i> gene) is known to influence the cardiac injury response, but its direct role in orchestrating programmed fibroblast differentiation and fibrosis in vivo is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A conditional <i>Mapk14</i> allele was used to delete the p38α encoding gene specifically in cardiac fibroblasts or myofibroblasts with 2 different tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase–expressing gene–targeted mouse lines. Mice were subjected to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation and monitored for survival, cardiac function, and fibrotic remodeling. Antithetically, mice with fibroblast-specific transgenic overexpression of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, a direct inducer of p38, were generated to investigate whether this pathway can directly drive myofibroblast formation and the cardiac fibrotic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In mice, loss of <i>Mapk14</i> blocked cardiac fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and ensuing fibrosis in response to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation. A similar inhibition of myofibroblast formation and healing was also observed in a dermal wounding model with deletion of <i>Mapk14</i>. Transgenic mice with fibroblast-specific activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6–p38 developed interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in the heart, lung, and kidney as a result of enhanced myofibroblast numbers. Mechanistic experiments show that p38 transduces cytokine and mechanical signals into myofibroblast differentiation through the transcription factor serum response factor and the signaling effector calcineurin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings suggest that signals from diverse modes of injury converge on p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase within the fibroblast to program the fibrotic response and myofibroblast formation in vivo, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach with p38 inhibitors for future clinical application.</p></sec>

Ischemic Cerebroprotection Conferred by Myeloid Lineage-Restricted or Global CD39 Transgene Expression
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cerebral tissue damage after an ischemic event can be exacerbated by inflammation and thrombosis. Elevated extracellular ATP and ADP levels are associated with cellular injury, inflammation, and thrombosis. Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (CD39), an enzyme expressed on the plasmalemma of leukocytes and endothelial cells, suppresses platelet activation and leukocyte infiltration by phosphohydrolyzing ATP/ADP. To investigate the effects of increased CD39 in an in vivo cerebral ischemia model, we developed a transgenic mouse expressing human CD39 (hCD39).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A floxed-stop sequence was inserted between the promoter and the hCD39 transcriptional start site, generating a mouse in which the expression of hCD39 can be controlled tissue-specifically using Cre recombinase mice. We generated mice that express hCD39 globally or in myeloid-lineage cells only. Cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct volumes were quantified by MRI after 48 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Both global and transgenic hCD39- and myeloid lineage CD39-overexpressing mice (transgenic, n=9; myeloid lineage, n=6) demonstrated significantly smaller cerebral infarct volumes compared with wild-type mice. Leukocytes from ischemic and contralateral hemispheres were analyzed by flow cytometry. Although contralateral hemispheres had equal numbers of macrophages and neutrophils, ischemic hemispheres from transgenic mice had less infiltration (n=4). Transgenic mice showed less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical deficit compared with wild-type mice (n=6).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This is the first report of transgenic overexpression of CD39 in mice imparting a protective phenotype after stroke, with reduced leukocyte infiltration, smaller infarct volumes, and decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical deficit.

Cardiovascular Effects of Performance-Enhancing Drugs
<p>Exercise and competitive sports should be associated with a wide range of health benefits with the potential to inspire a positive community health legacy. However, the reputation of sports is being threatened by an ever-expanding armamentarium of agents with real or perceived benefits in performance enhancement. In addition to the injustice of unfair advantage for dishonest athletes, significant potential health risks are associated with performance-enhancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s. Performance-enhancing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s may have an effect on the cardiovascular system by means of directly altering the myocardium, vasculature, and metabolism. However, less frequently considered is the potential for indirect effects caused through enabling athletes to push beyond normal physiological limits with the potential consequence of exercise-induced arrhythmias. This review will summarize the known health effects of PEDs but will also focus on the potentially greater health threat posed by the covert search for performance-enhancing agents that have yet to be recognized by the World Anti-Doping Agency. History has taught us that athletes are subjected to unmonitored trials with experimental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s that have little or no established efficacy or safety data. One approach to decrease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> abuse in sports would be to accept that there is a delay from when athletes start experimenting with novel agents to the time when authorities become aware of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s. This provides a window of opportunity for athletes to exploit with relative immunity. It could be argued that all off-label use of any agent should be deemed illegal.</p>

Discovery and inhibition of an interspecies gut bacterial pathway for Levodopa metabolism
<p>The human gut microbiota metabolizes the Parkinson’s disease medication Levodopa (<sc>l</sc>-dopa), potentially reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> availability and causing side effects. However, the organisms, genes, and enzymes responsible for this activity in patients and their susceptibility to inhibition by host-targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s are unknown. Here, we describe an interspecies pathway for gut bacterial <sc>l</sc>-dopa metabolism. Conversion of <sc>l</sc>-dopa to dopamine by a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent tyrosine decarboxylase from <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> is followed by transformation of dopamine to <i>m</i>-tyramine by a molybdenum-dependent dehydroxylase from <i>Eggerthella lenta</i>. These enzymes predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> metabolism in complex human gut microbiotas. Although a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> that targets host aromatic amino acid decarboxylase does not prevent gut microbial <sc>l</sc>-dopa decarboxylation, we identified a compound that inhibits this activity in Parkinson’s patient microbiotas and increases <sc>l</sc>-dopa bioavailability in mice.</p>

Toward a chemical vaccine for malaria
<p>Despite considerable progress in combating malaria, it remains one of the world's most important infectious diseases, with 50% of the world population at risk of developing the disease and a mortality rate of ∼0.5 million annually (<i>1</i>). The lack of an effective vaccine and the relentless ability of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite responsible for malaria to develop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> resistance has contributed to the continuing disease burden (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of current treatment regimens, but decreased effectiveness, particularly in Southeast Asia, threatens our ability to control this disease. A global effort to develop new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s for the treatment and prevention of malaria is under way but not guaranteed to succeed (<i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). These efforts include a systematic attempt to target all life-cycle stages of the parasite to allow combination therapies to be developed, which are also likely to reduce the development of resistance. High-throughput screens (HTSs) designed to identify small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-like molecules that prevent growth of blood-stage parasites (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and target-based approaches have identified new compounds that are currently in preclinical development and/or various stages of human clinical trials for treatment of malaria (<i>3</i>). Missing from these efforts has been a high-throughput technology to find liver stage–specific chemotypes. On page 1129 of this issue, Antonova-Koch <i>et al.</i> (<i>9</i>) report an HTS effort that has filled this gap. They identify a substantial number of new chemical starting points with potent liver-stage antimalarial activity, promising a new capacity to feed compounds through the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> development pipeline for chemoprotection.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
Epistasis and Pleiotropy Affect the Modularity of the Genotype–Phenotype Map of Cross-Resistance in HIV-1
<p>The genotype–phenotype (GP) map is a central concept in evolutionary biology as it describes the mapping of molecular genetic variation onto phenotypic trait variation. Our understanding of that mapping remains partial, especially when trying to link functional clustering of pleiotropic gene effects with patterns of phenotypic trait co-variation. Only on rare occasions have studies been able to fully explore that link and tend to show poor correspondence between modular structures within the GP map and among phenotypes. By dissecting the structure of the GP map of the replicative capacity of HIV-1 in 15 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> environments, we provide a detailed view of that mapping from mutational pleiotropic variation to phenotypic co-variation, including epistatic effects of a set of amino-acid substitutions in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes. We show that epistasis increases the pleiotropic degree of single mutations and provides modularity to the GP map of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> resistance in HIV-1. Moreover, modules of epistatic pleiotropic effects within the GP map match the phenotypic modules of correlated replicative capacity among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> classes. Epistasis thus increases the evolvability of cross-resistance in HIV by providing more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>- and class-specific pleiotropic profiles to the main effects of the mutations. We discuss the implications for the evolution of cross-resistance in HIV.</p>

A novel mouse model of Warburg Micro syndrome reveals roles for RAB18 in eye development and organisation of the neuronal cytoskeleton
<p>Mutations in <i>RAB18</i> have been shown to cause the heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder Warburg Micro syndrome (WARBM). Individuals with WARBM present with a range of clinical symptoms, including ocular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical abnormalities. However, the underlying cellular and molecular pathogenesis of the disorder remains unclear, largely owing to the lack of any robust animal models that phenocopy both the ocular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical features of the disease. We report here the generation and characterisation of a novel <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse model of WARBM. <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice are viable and fertile. They present with congenital nuclear cataracts and atonic pupils, recapitulating the characteristic ocular features that are associated with WARBM. Additionally, <i>Rab18</i>-mutant cells exhibit an increase in lipid droplet size following treatment with oleic acid. Lipid droplet abnormalities are a characteristic feature of cells taken from WARBM individuals, as well as cells taken from individuals with other neurodegenerative conditions. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical dysfunction is also apparent in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice, including progressive weakness of the hind limbs. We show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical defects are, most likely, not caused by gross perturbations in synaptic vesicle recycling in the central or peripheral nervous system. Rather, loss of <i>Rab18</i> is associated with widespread disruption of the neuronal cytoskeleton, including abnormal accumulations of neurofilament and microtubule proteins in synaptic terminals, and gross disorganisation of the cytoskeleton in peripheral nerves. Global proteomic profiling of peripheral nerves in <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mice reveals significant alterations in several core molecular pathways that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in neurons. The apparent similarities between the WARBM phenotype and the phenotype that we describe here indicate that the <i>Rab18</i>-mutant mouse provides an important platform for investigation of the disease pathogenesis and therapeutic interventions.</p>

Precise control of miR-125b levels is required to create a regeneration-permissive environment after spinal cord injury: a cross-species comparison between salamander and rat
<p>Most spinal cord <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es lead to permanent paralysis in mammals. By contrast, the remarkable regenerative abilities of salamanders enable full functional recovery even from complete spinal cord transections. The molecular differences underlying this evolutionary divergence between mammals and amphibians are poorly understood. We focused on upstream regulators of gene expression as primary entry points into this question. We identified a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are conserved between the Mexican axolotl salamander (<i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>) and mammals but show marked cross-species differences in regulation patterns following spinal cord injury. We found that precise post-injury levels of one of these miRNAs (miR-125b) is essential for functional recovery, and guides correct regeneration of axons through the lesion site in a process involving the direct downstream target <i>Sema4D</i> in axolotls. Translating these results to a mammalian model, we increased miR-125b levels in the rat through mimic treatments following spinal cord transection. These treatments downregulated <i>Sema4D</i> and other glial-scar-related genes, and enhanced the animal’s functional recovery. Our study identifies a key regulatory molecule conserved between salamander and mammal, and shows that the expression of <i>miR-125b</i> and <i>Sema4D</i> must be carefully controlled in the right cells at the correct level to promote regeneration. We also show that these molecular components of the salamander’s regeneration-permissive environment can be experimentally harnessed to improve treatment outcomes for mammalian spinal cord <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es.</p>

Mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate in response to traumatic bone injury in the zebrafish fin and skull
<p>Zebrafish have an unlimited capacity to regenerate bone after fin amputation. In this process, mature osteoblasts dedifferentiate to osteogenic precursor cells and thus represent an important source of newly forming bone. By contrast, differentiated osteoblasts do not appear to contribute to repair of bone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es in mammals; rather, osteoblasts form anew from mesenchymal stem cells. This raises the question whether osteoblast dedifferentiation is specific to appendage regeneration, a special feature of the lepidotrichia bone of the fish fin, or a process found more generally in fish bone. Here, we show that dedifferentiation of mature osteoblasts is not restricted to fin regeneration after amputation, but also occurs during repair of zebrafish fin fractures and skull <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es. In both models, mature osteoblasts surrounding the injury downregulate the expression of differentiation markers, upregulate markers of the pre-osteoblast state and become proliferative. Making use of photoconvertible Kaede protein as well as Cre-driven genetic fate mapping, we show that osteoblasts migrate to the site of injury to replace damaged tissue. Our findings suggest a fundamental role for osteoblast dedifferentiation in reparative bone formation in fish and indicate that adult fish osteoblasts display elevated cellular plasticity compared with mammalian bone-forming cells.</p>

Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor Type I Controls Cardiomyocyte Transforming Growth Factor-β and Cardiac Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Fibrosis is the pathological consequence of stress-induced tissue remodeling and matrix accumulation. Increased levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) have been shown to promote fibrosis in multiple organ systems. Paradoxically, homozygous genetic deficiency of PAI-1 is associated with spontaneous age-dependent, cardiac-selective fibrosis in mice. We have identified a novel PAI-1-dependent mechanism that regulates cardiomyocyte-derived fibrogenic signals and cardiac transcriptional pathways during injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis in subjects with homozygous mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i> was evaluated with late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. A murine cardiac injury model was performed by subcutaneous infusion of either saline or Angiotensin II by osmotic minipumps. We evaluated blood pressure, cardiac function (by echocardiography), fibrosis (with Masson Trichrome staining), and apoptosis (with TUNEL staining), and we performed transcriptome analysis (with RNA sequencing). We further evaluated fibrotic signaling in isolated murine primary ventricular myocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Cardiac fibrosis was detected in 2 otherwise healthy humans with complete PAI-1 deficiency because of a homozygous frameshift mutation in <i>SERPINE-1</i>. In addition to its suppressive role during spontaneous cardiac fibrosis in multiple species, we hypothesized that PAI-1 also regulates fibrosis during cardiac injury. Treatment of young PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice with Angiotensin II induced extensive hypertrophy and fibrotic cardiomyopathy, with increased cardiac apoptosis and both reactive and replacement fibrosis. Although Angiotensin II-induced hypertension was blunted in PAI-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, cardiac hypertrophy was accelerated. Furthermore, ventricular myocytes were found to be an important source of cardiac transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and PAI-1 regulated TGF-β synthesis by cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as in vivo during cardiac injury. Transcriptome analysis of ventricular RNA after Angiotensin II treatment confirmed that PAI-1 deficiency significantly enhanced multiple TGF-β signaling elements and transcriptional targets, including genes for extracellular matrix components, mediators of extracellular matrix remodeling, matricellular proteins, and cardiac integrins compared with wild-type mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>PAI-1 is an essential repressor of cardiac fibrosis in mammals. We define a novel cardiomyocyte-specific regulatory mechanism for TGF-β production by PAI-1, which explains the paradoxical effect of PAI-1 deficiency in promoting cardiac-selective fibrosis. Thus, PAI-1 is a molecular switch that controls the cardiac TGF-β axis and its early transcriptional effects that lead to myocardial fibrosis.</p></sec>

However, the clinical effectiveness of additional rescue breathing (conventional CPR) compared with compression-only CPR in children is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This nationwide population-based study of pediatric OHCA patients was based on data from the All-Japan Utstein Registry. We included all pediatric patients who experienced OHCA in Japan from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012. The primary outcome was a favorable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical state 1 month after OHCA defined as a Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 to 2 (corresponding to a Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score of 1–3). Outcomes were compared with logistic regression with uni- and multivariable modeling in the overall cohort and for a propensity-matched subset of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 2157 patients were included; 417 received conventional CPR, 733 received compression-only CPR, and 1007 did not receive any bystander CPR. Among these patients, 213 (9.9%) survived with a favorable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ical status 1 month after OHCA, including 108/417 (25.9%) for conventional, 68/733 (9.3%) for compression-only, and 37/1007 (3.7%) for no-bystander CPR. In unadjusted analyses, conventional CPR was superior to compression-only CPR in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ically favorable survival (odds ratio [OR] 3.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.45–4.76; <i>P</i><0.0001), with a trend favoring conventional CPR that was no longer statistically significant after multivariable adjustment (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 1.52, 95% CI 0.93–2.49), and with further attenuation of the difference in a propensity-matched subset (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.81–1.77). Both conventional and compression-only CPR were associated with higher odds for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">neurolog</span></strong>ically favorable survival compared with no-bystander CPR (OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 5.01, 95% CI 2.98–8.57, and OR<sub>adjusted</sub> 3.29, 95% CI 1.93–5.71), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this population-based study of pediatric OHCA in Japan, both conventional and compression-only CPR were associated with superior outcomes compared with no-bystander CPR. Unadjusted outcomes with conventional CPR were superior to compression-only CPR, with the magnitude of difference attenuated and no longer statistically significant after statistical adjustments. These findings support randomized clinical trials comparing conventional versus compression-only CPR in children, with conventional CPR preferred until such controlled comparative data are available, and either method preferred over no-bystander CPR.</p></sec>

Chemogenetics revealed: DREADD occupancy and activation via converted clozapine
<p>The chemogenetic technology DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s) is widely used for remote manipulation of neuronal activity in freely moving animals. DREADD technology posits the use of “designer receptors,” which are exclusively activated by the “designer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>” clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Nevertheless, the in vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed. CNO does not enter the brain after systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> injections and shows low affinity for DREADDs. Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency. Upon systemic CNO injections, converted clozapine readily enters the brain and occupies central nervous system–expressed DREADDs, whereas systemic subthreshold clozapine injections induce preferential DREADD-mediated behaviors.</p>

Easier cure for resistant TB
<p>A new treatment strategy has had astonishing success against extensively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB), which kills more than 70% of patients. XDR and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>-resistant forms of TB are burgeoning among people with HIV, and current treatments are so prolonged and toxic that many patients fail to adhere to them. But a small study now shows that a simpler, safer regimen can cure the disease. Called Nix-TB, the trial has had 34 people in South Africa with XDR on three antibiotics that have never been combined before to treat TB. After 6 months, the TB bacillus could not be cultured from anyone's sputum, a sign that they had cleared the infection. More impressive, 20 people stopped taking the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s at that point and none relapsed.</p>

Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a biological system with small molecules to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as chemical biology. Small molecules are used commercially as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, chemical genetics involves the discovery of small-molecule effectors of various cellular functions through screens of compound libraries. Whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> optimization, chemical genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small molecules that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in chemical genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small molecules identified in screens designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given chemical genetics approach.</p>

Genome-Wide Analysis of Selection on the Malaria Parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in West African Populations of Differing Infection Endemicity
<p>Locally varying selection on pathogens may be due to differences in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities between hosts, or the intensity of between-genotype competition within hosts. Highly recombining populations of the human malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> throughout West Africa are closely related, as gene flow is relatively unrestricted in this endemic region, but markedly varying ecology and transmission intensity should cause distinct local selective pressures. Genome-wide analysis of sequence variation was undertaken on a sample of 100 <i>P. falciparum</i> clinical isolates from a highly endemic region of the Republic of Guinea where transmission occurs for most of each year and compared with data from 52 clinical isolates from a previously sampled population from The Gambia, where there is relatively limited seasonal malaria transmission. Paired-end short-read sequences were mapped against the 3D7 <i>P. falciparum</i> reference genome sequence, and data on 136,144 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained. Within-population analyses identifying loci showing evidence of recent positive directional selection and balancing selection confirm that antimalarial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong>s and host immunity have been major selective agents. Many of the signatures of recent directional selection reflected by standardized integrated haplotype scores were population specific, including differences at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drug</span></strong> resistance loci due to historically different antimalarial use between the countries. In contrast, both populations showed a similar set of loci likely to be under balancing selection as indicated by very high Tajima’s <i>D</i> values, including a significant overrepresentation of genes expressed at the merozoite stage that invades erythrocytes and several previously validated targets of acquired immunity. Between-population <i>F</i><sub>ST</sub> analysis identified exceptional differentiation of allele frequencies at a small number of loci, most markedly for five SNPs covering a 15-kb region within and flanking the <i>gdv1</i> gene that regulates the early stages of gametocyte development, which is likely related to the extreme differences in mosquito vector abundance and seasonality that determine the transmission opportunities for the sexual stage of the parasite.</p>

Prospective randomised trial of non-operative <i>versus</i> operative management of olecranon fractures in the elderly
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this prospective randomised controlled trial was to   compare non-operative and operative management for acute isolated   displaced fractures of the olecranon in patients aged ≥ 75 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Patients were randomised to either non-operative management or   operative management with either tension-band wiring or fixation   with a plate. They were reviewed at six weeks, three and six months   and one year after the injury. The primary outcome measure was the   Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score at one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 19 patients were randomised to non-operative (n =   8) or operative (n = 11; tension-band wiring (n = 9), plate (n =   2)) management. The trial was stopped prematurely as the rate of   complications (nine out of 11, 81.8%) in the operative group was   considered to be unacceptable. There was, however, no difference   in the mean DASH scores between the groups at all times. The mean   score was 23 (0 to 59.6) in the non-operative group and 22 (2.5   to 57.8) in the operative group, one year after the injury (p =   0.763). There was no significant difference between groups in the   secondary outcome measures of the Broberg and Morrey Score or the   Mayo Elbow Score at any time during the one year following injury   (all    p ≥ 0.05). </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data further support the role of primary non-operative   management of isolated displaced fractures of the olecranon in the   elderly.

Long-term survival and risk factors for failure of the native hip joint after operatively treated displaced acetabular fractures
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Our aim in this study was to describe the long-term survival   of the native hip joint after open reduction and internal fixation   of a displaced fracture of the acetabulum. We also present long-term   clinical outcomes and risk factors associated with a poor outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 285 patients underwent surgery for a displaced acetabular   fracture between 1993 and 2005. For the survival analysis 253 were   included, there were 197 men and 56 women with a mean age of 42   years (12 to 78). The mean follow-up of 11 years (1 to 20) was identified   from our pelvic fracture registry. There were 99 elementary and 154   associated fracture types. For the long-term clinical follow-up,   192 patients with complete data were included. Their mean age was   40 years (13 to 78) with a mean follow-up of 12 years (5 to 20).   Injury to the femoral head and acetabular impaction were assessed   with CT scans and patients with an ipsilateral fracture of the femoral   head were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 36 patients underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA).   The overall ten-year survival of the hip joint was 86% (95% confidence   interval (CI) 81% to 90%) and the 20-year survival was 82% (95%   CI 76% to 87%). Injury to the femoral head and acetabular impaction   were the strongest predictors of failure, with the long-term survival   rate falling towards 50% in these patients. The survival fell to   0% at three years when both these risk factors were present in patients   aged > 60 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The long-term survival of the native hip joint after acetabular   fractures was good, but the presence of injury to the femoral head   and acetabular impaction proved to be strong predictors of failure,   especially in patients aged > 60 years.

The management of open tibial fractures in children
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Following the introduction of national standards in 2009, most   major paediatric trauma is now triaged to specialist units offering   combined orthopaedic and plastic surgical expertise. We investigated   the management of open tibia fractures at a paediatric trauma centre,   primarily reporting the risk of infection and rate of union.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A retrospective review was performed on 61 children who between   2007 and 2015 presented with an open tibia fracture. Their mean   age was nine years (2 to 16) and the median follow-up was ten months   (interquartile range 5 to 18). Management involved IV antibiotics,   early debridement and combined treatment of the skeletal and soft-tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es   in line with standards proposed by the British Orthopaedic Association.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were 36 diaphyseal fractures and 25 distal tibial fractures.   Of the distal fractures, eight involved the physis. Motor vehicle   collisions accounted for two thirds of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es and 38 patients   (62%) arrived outside of normal working hours. The initial method   of stabilisation comprised: casting in nine cases (15%); elastic   nailing in 19 (31%); Kirschner (K)-wiring in 13 (21%); intramedullary   nailing in one (2%); open reduction and plate fixation in four (7%); and   external fixation in 15 (25%). Wound management comprised: primary   wound closure in 24 (39%), delayed primary closure in 11 (18%),   split skin graft (SSG) in eight (13%), local flap with SSG in 17   (28%) and a free flap in one. A total of 43 fractures (70%) were   Gustilo-Anderson grade III. There were four superficial (6.6%) and   three (4.9%) deep infections. Two deep infections occurred following   open reduction and plate fixation and the third after    K-wire fixation of a distal fracture. No patient who underwent primary   wound closure developed an infection. All the fractures united,   although nine patients required revision of a mono-lateral to circular   frame for delayed union (two) or for altered alignment or length   (seven). The mean time to union was two weeks longer in diaphyseal fractures   than in distal fractures (13 weeks <i>versus</i> 10.8   weeks, p<i> = </i>0.016). Children aged > 12 years had   a significantly longer time to union than those aged < 12 years   (16.3 weeks <i>versus</i> 11.4 weeks, p<i> = </i>0.045).   The length of stay in hospital for patients with a Gustilo-Anderson   grade IIIB fracture was twice as long as for less severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Fractures in children heal better than those in adults. Based   on our experience of deep infection we discourage the use of internal   fixation with a plate for open tibial fractures in children. We   advocate aggressive initial wound debridement in theatre with early   definitive combined orthopaedic and plastic surgery in order to   obtain skeletal stabilisation and soft-tissue cover.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:544–53.</p></sec>

The evolution of fracture clinic design
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fracture clinics are often characterised by the referral of large   numbers of unselected patients with minor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es not requiring   investigation or intervention, long waiting times and recurrent   unnecessary reviews. Our experience had been of an unsustainable   system and we implemented a ‘Trauma Triage Clinic’ (TTC) in order   to rationalise and regulate access to our fracture service. The   British Orthopaedic Association’s guidelines have required a prospective evaluation   of this change of practice, and we report our experience and results.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We review the management of all 12 069 patients referred to our   service in the calendar year 2014, with a minimum of one year follow-up   during the calendar year 2015. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Following the successful introduction of the TTC, only 2836 patients   (23.5%) who would previously have been reviewed in the general fracture   clinic were brought back to such a clinic to be seen by a surgeon.   An additional 2366 patients (19.6%) were brought back to a sub-specialist   injury-specific clinic. Another 2776 patients (23%) with relatively   predictable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es were reviewed by a nurse practitioner according   to an established protocol or specific consultant instructions.   A further 3222 patients (26.7%) were discharged from the service   without attending the clinic. No significant errors or omissions   occurred with the introduction of the TTC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have found that our TTC allows large numbers of referrals   to be reviewed and triaged safely and effectively, to the benefit   and satisfaction of patients, consultants, trainees, staff and the   organisation. This paper provides the first large-scale review of   the instigation of a TTC, and its effect, acceptability and safety.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:503–7.</p></sec>

The impact of external fixation on mortality in patients with an unstable pelvic ring fracture
<sec><title>Aim</title><p>There is not adequate evidence to establish whether external   fixation (EF) of pelvic fractures leads to a reduced mortality.   We used the Japan Trauma Data Bank database to identify isolated   unstable pelvic ring fractures to exclude the possibility of blood   loss from other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es, and analyzed the effectiveness of EF on   mortality in this group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This was a registry-based comparison of 1163 patients who had   been treated for an isolated unstable pelvic ring fracture with   (386 patients) or without (777 patients) EF. An isolated pelvic   ring fracture was defined by an Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) for   other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es of < 3. An unstable pelvic ring fracture was defined   as having an AIS ≥ 4. The primary outcome of this study was mortality.   A subgroup analysis was carried out for patients who required blood   transfusion within 24 hours of arrival in the Emergency Department   and those who had massive blood loss (AIS code: 852610.5). Propensity-score   matching was used to identify a cohort like the EF and non-EF groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With the use of propensity-score matching using the completed   data, 346 patients were matched. When the propensity-score matching   was adjusted, EF was associated with a significantly lower risk   of death (p = 0.047). In the subgroup analysis of patients who needed   blood transfusion within 24 hours and those who had massive blood loss,   EF was associated with a significantly lower risk of death in patients   who needed blood transfusion within 24 hours (p = 0.014) and in   those with massive blood loss (p = 0.016).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The use of EF to treat unstable pelvic ring fractures was associated   with a significantly lower risk of death, especially in patients   with severe fractures.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2018;100-B:233–41.</p></sec>

A call to arms against the other retrovirus
<p>The discovery of the first human retrovirus, human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1), in 1980 was a minor scientific sensation. But HTLV-1 was soon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eclips</span></strong>ed by another retrovirus that would go on to kill more than 35 million people and keep generations of scientists busy: HIV. In a 10 May open letter to the World Health Organization, 59 virologists, epidemiologists, and patient advocates call for a new global effort to eradicate HTLV-1, which infects millions and causes cancer and several other diseases. Just like HIV, HTLV-1 spreads through blood, semen, and breast milk, and the letter argues that the same testing and prevention strategies used against HIV could stop HTLV-1.</p>

Two-dimensional sp<sup>2</sup> carbon–conjugated covalent organic frameworks
<p>We synthesized a two-dimensional (2D) crystalline covalent organic framework (sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF) that was designed to be fully π-conjugated and constructed from all sp<sup>2</sup> carbons by C=C condensation reactions of tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene and 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile. The C=C linkages topologically connect pyrene knots at regular intervals into a 2D lattice with π conjugations extended along both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions and develop an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eclips</span></strong>ed layer framework rather than the more conventionally obtained disordered structures. The sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF is a semiconductor with a discrete band gap of 1.9 electron volts and can be chemically oxidized to enhance conductivity by 12 orders of magnitude. The generated radicals are confined on the pyrene knots, enabling the formation of a paramagnetic carbon structure with high spin density. The sp<sup>2</sup> carbon framework induces ferromagnetic phase transition to develop spin-spin coherence and align spins unidirectionally across the material.</p>

Relativistic deflection of background starlight measures the mass of a nearby white dwarf star
<p>Gravitational deflection of starlight around the Sun during the 1919 total solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eclips</span></strong>e provided measurements that confirmed Einstein’s general theory of relativity. We have used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the analogous process of astrometric microlensing caused by a nearby star, the white dwarf Stein 2051 B. As Stein 2051 B passed closely in front of a background star, the background star’s position was deflected. Measurement of this deflection at multiple epochs allowed us to determine the mass of Stein 2051 B—the sixth-nearest white dwarf to the Sun—as 0.675 ± 0.051 solar masses. This mass determination provides confirmation of the physics of degenerate matter and lends support to white dwarf evolutionary theory.</p>

Early Senescence in Older Leaves of Low Nitrate-Grown <i>Atxdh1</i> Uncovers a Role for Purine Catabolism in N Supply
<p>The nitrogen (N)-rich ureides allantoin and allantoate, which are products of purine catabolism, play a role in N delivery in Leguminosae. Here, we examined their role as an N source in nonlegume plants using Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants mutated in XANTHINE DEHYDROGENASE1 (AtXDH1), a catalytic bottleneck in purine catabolism. Older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of the <i>Atxdh1</i> mutant exhibited early senescence, lower soluble protein, and lower organic N levels as compared with wild-type older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es when grown with 1 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate but were comparable to the wild type under 5 m<sc>m</sc> nitrate. Similar nitrate-dependent senescence phenotypes were evident in the older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of <i>allantoinase</i> (<i>Ataln</i>) and <i>allantoate amidohydrolase</i> (<i>Ataah</i>) mutants, which also are impaired in purine catabolism. Under low-nitrate conditions, xanthine accumulated in older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of <i>Atxdh1</i>, whereas allantoin accumulated in both older and younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of <i>Ataln</i> but not in wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, indicating the remobilization of xanthine-degraded products from older to younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Supporting this notion, ureide transporter expression was enhanced in older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of the wild type in low-nitrate as compared with high-nitrate conditions. Elevated transcripts and proteins of AtXDH and AtAAH were detected in low-nitrate-grown wild-type plants, indicating regulation at protein and transcript levels. The higher nitrate reductase activity in <i>Atxdh1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es compared with wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es indicated a need for nitrate assimilation products. Together, these results indicate that the absence of remobilized purine-degraded N from older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of <i>Atxdh1</i> caused senescence symptoms, a result of higher chloroplastic protein degradation in older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of low-nitrate-grown plants.</p>

Combined effects of defoliation and water stress on pine growth and non-structural carbohydrates
<p>Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (<i>Pinus pinaster</i> Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ation can limit the impact of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ated and that (ii) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.</p>

Classifying drivers of global forest loss
<p>Global maps of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss depict the scale and magnitude of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> disturbance, yet companies, governments, and nongovernmental organizations need to distinguish permanent conversion (i.e., <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong></span></strong>ation) from temporary loss from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ry or wildfire. Using satellite imagery, we developed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss classification model to determine a spatial attribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> disturbance to the dominant drivers of land cover and land use change over the period 2001 to 2015. Our results indicate that 27% of global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> loss can be attributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong></span></strong>ation through permanent land use change for commodity production. The remaining areas maintained the same land use over 15 years; in those areas, loss was attributed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>ry (26%), shifting agriculture (24%), and wildfire (23%). Despite corporate commitments, the rate of commodity-driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong></span></strong>ation has not declined.

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Enhanced Secondary- and Hormone Metabolism in Leaves of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal <i>Medicago truncatula</i>
<p>Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are the most common symbiotic associations between a plant’s root compartment and fungi. They provide nutritional benefit (mostly inorganic phosphate [P<sub>i</sub>]), leading to improved growth, and nonnutritional benefits, including defense responses to environmental cues throughout the host plant, which, in return, delivers carbohydrates to the symbiont. However, how transcriptional and metabolic changes occurring in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of AM plants differ from those induced by P<sub>i</sub> fertilization is poorly understood. We investigated systemic changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of mycorrhized <i>Medicago truncatula</i> in conditions with no improved P<sub>i</sub> status and compared them with those induced by high-P<sub>i</sub> treatment in nonmycorrhized plants. Microarray-based genome-wide profiling indicated up-regulation by mycorrhization of genes involved in flavonoid, terpenoid, jasmonic acid (JA), and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis as well as enhanced expression of <i>MYC2</i>, the master regulator of JA-dependent responses. Accordingly, total anthocyanins and flavonoids increased, and most flavonoid species were enriched in AM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Both the AM and P<sub>i</sub> treatments corepressed iron homeostasis genes, resulting in lower levels of available iron in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. In addition, higher levels of cytokinins were found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of AM- and P<sub>i</sub>-treated plants, whereas the level of ABA was increased specifically in AM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Foliar treatment of nonmycorrhized plants with either ABA or JA induced the up-regulation of <i>MYC2</i>, but only JA also induced the up-regulation of flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthetic genes. Based on these results, we propose that mycorrhization and P<sub>i</sub> fertilization share cytokinin-mediated improved shoot growth, whereas enhanced ABA biosynthesis and JA-regulated flavonoid and terpenoid biosynthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es are specific to mycorrhization.</p>

Leaf Endoplasmic Reticulum Bodies Identified in Arabidopsis Rosette Leaves Are Involved in Defense against Herbivory
<p>ER bodies are endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived organelles specific to the order Brassicales and are thought to function in plant defense against insects and pathogens. ER bodies are generally classified into two types: constitutive ER bodies in the epidermal cells of seedlings, and wound-inducible ER bodies in rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Herein, we reveal a third type of ER body found in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and designate them “leaf ERbodies” (L-ER bodies). L-ER bodies constitutively occurred in specific cells of the rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es: marginal cells, epidermal cells covering the midrib, and giant pavement cells. The distribution of L-ER bodies was closely associated with the expression profile of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NAI1, which is responsible for constitutive ER-body formation. L-ER bodies were seldom observed in <i>nai1</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, indicating that NAI1 is involved in L-ER body formation. Confocal imaging analysis revealed that L-ER bodies accumulated two types of β-glucosidases: PYK10, the constitutive ER-body β-glucosidase; and BETA-GLUCOSIDASE18 (BGLU18), the wound-inducible ER-body β-glucosidase. Combined with the absence of L-ER bodies in the <i>bglu18 pyk10</i> mutant, these results indicate that BGLU18 and PYK10 are the major components of L-ER bodies. A subsequent feeding assay with the terrestrial isopod <i>Armadillidium vulgare</i> revealed that <i>bglu18 pyk10</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es were severely damaged as a result of herbivory. In addition, the <i>bglu18 pyk10</i> mutant was defective in the hydrolysis of 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate These results suggest that L-ER bodies are involved in the production of defensive compound(s) from 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate that protect Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es against herbivory attack.</p>

Red Light-Induced Phosphorylation of Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in Stomatal Guard Cells
<p>Stomatal opening is stimulated by red and blue light. Blue light activates plasma membrane (PM) H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase by phosphorylating its penultimate residue, threonine, via a blue light photoreceptor phototropin-mediated signaling pathway in guard cells. Blue light-activated PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase promotes the accumulation of osmolytes and, thus, the osmotic influx of water into guard cells, driving stomatal opening. Red light-induced stomatal opening is thought to be dependent on photosynthesis in both guard cell chloroplasts and mesophyll cells; however, how red light induces stomatal opening and whether PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is involved in this process have remained unclear. In this study, we established an immunohistochemical technique to detect the phosphorylation level of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells using whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and unexpectedly found that red light induces PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es was correlated with stomatal opening under red light and was inhibited by the plant hormone abscisic acid. In <i>aha1</i>-<i>9</i>, a knockout mutant of one of the major isoforms of PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in guard cells, red light-dependent stomatal opening was delayed in whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Furthermore, the photosynthetic electron transport inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea inhibited red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation as well as red light-induced stomatal opening in whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Our results indicate that red light-induced PM H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase phosphorylation in guard cells promotes stomatal opening in whole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, providing insight into the photosynthetic regulation of stomatal opening.</p>

Leaf and Plant Age Affects Photosynthetic Performance and Photoprotective Capacity
<p>In this work, we studied the changes in high-light tolerance and photosynthetic activity in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette throughout the vegetative stage of growth. We implemented an image-analysis work flow to analyze the capacity of both the whole plant and individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es to cope with excess excitation energy by following the changes in absorbed light energy partitioning. The data show that leaf and plant age are both important factors influencing the fate of excitation energy. During the dark-to-light transition, the age of the plant affects mostly steady-state levels of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching, leading to an increased photosynthetic performance of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. The age of the leaf affects the induction kinetics of nonphotochemical quenching. These observations were confirmed using model selection procedures. We further investigated how different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es on a rosette acclimate to high light and show that younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es are less prone to photoinhibition than older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Our results stress that both plant and leaf age should be taken into consideration during the quantification of photosynthetic and photoprotective traits to produce repeatable and reliable results.</p>

Organ-coordinated response of early post-germination mahogany seedlings to drought
<p>Water deficit tolerance during post-germination stages is critical for seedling recruitment. In this work, we studied the effect of water deficit on morphological and biochemical responses in different organs of newly germinated mahogany (<i>Swietenia macrophylla</i> King) seedlings, a woody species that occurs in the Amazon rain<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>. The root : shoot ratio increased under water deficit. The leaf number and water potential were not altered, although reductions in leaf area and stomatal conductance were observed. Osmotic potential became more negative in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of seedlings under severe stress. Water deficit increased fructose, glucose, sucrose and myo-inositol levels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Stems accumulated fructose, glucose and <sc>l</sc>-proline. Nitric oxide (NO) levels increased in the vascular cylinder of roots under severe stress while superoxide anion levels decreased due to augmented superoxide dismutase activity in this organ. Water deficit induced glutathione reductase activity in both roots and stems. Upon moderate or severe stress, catalase activity decreased in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and remained unaffected in the other seedling organs, allowing for an increase of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) levels in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Overall, the increase of signaling molecules in distinct organs—NO in roots, <sc>l</sc>-proline in stems and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and myo-inositol in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es—contributed to the response of mahogany seedlings to water deficit by triggering biochemical processes that resulted in the attenuation of oxidative stress and the establishment of osmotic adjustment. Therefore, this body of evidence reveals that the development of newly germinated mahogany seedlings may occur in both natural habitats and crop fields even when water availability is greatly limited.</p>

Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed systemic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, and to a lesser degree in systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. These could be important in defining the specificity of the systemic response as well as in supporting the generation of different systemic signals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, systemic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the systemic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the systemically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, systemic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the systemic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and systemic tissues play an important role in systemic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid systemic response of plants to light stress.</p>

Spatial Control of Gene Expression by miR319-Regulated TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>The characteristic leaf shapes we see in all plants are in good part the outcome of the combined action of several transcription factor networks that translate into cell division activity during the early development of the organ. We show here that wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es have distinct transcriptomic profiles in center and marginal regions. Certain transcripts are enriched in margins, including those of <i>CINCINNATA</i>-like <i>TCPs</i> (<i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED, CYCLOIDEA</i> and <i>PCF1/2</i>) and members of the <i>NGATHA</i> and <i>STYLISH</i> gene families. We study in detail the contribution of microRNA319 (miR319)-regulated TCP transcription factors to the development of the center and marginal regions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. We compare in molecular analyses the wild type, the <i>tcp2 tcp4</i> mutant that has enlarged flat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, and the <i>tcp2 tcp3 tcp4 tcp10</i> mutant with strongly crinkled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. The different leaf domains of the <i>tcp</i> mutants show changed expression patterns for many photosynthesis-related genes, indicating delayed differentiation, especially in the marginal parts of the organ. At the same time, we found an up-regulation of cyclin genes and other genes that are known to participate in cell division, specifically in the marginal regions of <i>tcp2 tcp3 tcp4 tcp10</i>. Using GUS reporter constructs, we confirmed extended mitotic activity in the <i>tcp2 tcp3 tcp4 tcp10</i> leaf, which persisted in small defined foci in the margins when the mitotic activity had already ceased in wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Our results describe the role of miR319-regulated TCP transcription factors in the coordination of activities in different leaf domains during organ development.</p>

Excess Diffuse Light Absorption in Upper Mesophyll Limits CO<sub>2</sub> Drawdown and Depresses Photosynthesis
<p>In agricultural and natural systems, diffuse light can enhance plant primary productivity due to deeper penetration into and greater irradiance of the entire canopy. However, for individual sun-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es from three species, photosynthesis is actually less efficient under diffuse compared with direct light. Despite its potential impact on canopy-level productivity, the mechanism for this leaf-level diffuse light photosynthetic depression effect is unknown. Here, we investigate if the spatial distribution of light absorption relative to electron transport capacity in sun- and shade-grown sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es underlies its previously observed diffuse light photosynthetic depression. Using a new one-dimensional porous medium finite element gas-exchange model parameterized with light absorption profiles, we found that weaker penetration of diffuse versus direct light into the mesophyll of sun-grown sunflower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es led to a more heterogenous saturation of electron transport capacity and lowered its CO<sub>2</sub> concentration drawdown capacity in the intercellular airspace and chloroplast stroma. This decoupling of light availability from photosynthetic capacity under diffuse light is sufficient to generate an 11% decline in photosynthesis in sun-grown but not shade-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, primarily because thin shade-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es similarly distribute diffuse and direct light throughout the mesophyll. Finally, we illustrate how diffuse light photosynthetic depression could overcome enhancement in canopies with low light extinction coefficients and/or leaf area, pointing toward a novel direction for future research.</p>

Stomatal Closure, Basal Leaf Embolism, and Shedding Protect the Hydraulic Integrity of Grape Stems
<p>The time scale of stomatal closure and xylem cavitation during plant dehydration, as well as the fate of embolized organs, are under debate, largely due to methodological limitations in the evaluation of embolism. While some argue that complete stomatal closure precedes the occurrence of embolism, others believe that the two are contemporaneous processes that are accompanied by daily xylem refilling. Here, we utilize an optical light transmission method to continuously monitor xylem cavitation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of dehydrating grapevine (<i>Vitis vinifera</i>) in concert with stomatal conductance and stem and petiole hydraulic measurements. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to continuously monitor xylem cavitation and flow rates in the stem of an intact vine during 10 d of dehydration. The results showed that complete stomatal closure preceded the appearance of embolism in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and the stem by several days. Basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es were more vulnerable to xylem embolism than apical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and, once embolized, were shed, thereby preventing further water loss and protecting the hydraulic integrity of younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and the stem. As a result, embolism in the stem was minimal even when drought led to complete leaf shedding. These findings suggest that grapevine avoids xylem embolism rather than tolerates it.</p>

Heteroblastic Development of Transfer Cells Is Controlled by the microRNA miR156/SPL Module
<p>We report that wall ingrowth deposition in phloem parenchyma (PP) transfer cells (TCs) in leaf veins of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) represents a novel trait of heteroblasty. Development of PP TCs involves extensive deposition of wall ingrowths adjacent to cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. These PP TCs potentially facilitate phloem loading by enhancing efflux of symplasmic Suc for subsequent active uptake into cells of the sieve element/companion cell complex. PP TCs with extensive wall ingrowths are ubiquitous in mature cotyledons and juvenile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, but dramatically less so in mature adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, an observation consistent with PP TC development reflecting vegetative phase change (VPC) in Arabidopsis. Consistent with this conclusion, the abundance of PP TCs with extensive wall ingrowths varied across rosette development in three ecotypes displaying differing durations of juvenile phase, and extensive deposition of wall ingrowths was observed in rejuvenated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es following prolonged <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ation. PP TC development across juvenile, transition, and adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es correlated positively with levels of miR156, a major regulator of VPC in plants, and corresponding changes in wall ingrowth deposition were observed when miR156 was overexpressed or its activity suppressed by target mimicry. Analysis of plants carrying miR156-resistant forms of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE</i> (<i>SPL</i>) genes showed that wall ingrowth deposition was increased in <i>SPL9</i>-group but not <i>SPL3</i>-group genes, indicating that <i>SPL9</i>-group genes may function as negative regulators of wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs. Collectively, our results point to wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs being under control of the genetic program regulating VPC.</p>

Calcium Deficiency Triggers Phloem Remobilization of Cadmium in a Hyperaccumulating Species
<p>Understanding cadmium (Cd) accumulation in plants is critical for the development of plant-based strategies for soil remediation and crop safety. <i>Sedum alfredii</i> is a nonbrassica plant species known to hyperaccumulate Cd. The characteristics of Cd uptake, distribution, and retranslocation affected by the Ca status were investigated at cellular levels in <i>S. alfredii</i>. Low Ca supply significantly increased Cd contents in shoots of <i>S. alfredii</i>, particularly in the young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Micro x-ray fluorescence images confirmed that sequestration of Cd was greatly enhanced in the young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es under Ca deficiency stress, with a significant amount of Cd localized in mesophyll cells, compared to the young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es supplied with high Ca levels. Cd influx into protoplasts isolated from young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es was significantly inhibited by the addition of Ca channel inhibitors, but not by pre-exposure to Ca deficiency. In stems, the Cd signal in vascular systems under low Ca levels was 10-fold higher than in those treated with higher Ca levels. A detailed investigation of vascular bundles revealed that an extremely high Cd signal induced by low Ca supply occurred in the phloem tissues, but not in the xylem tissues. Transfer of Cd pretreated plants to nutrient solutions at different Ca levels confirmed that a much higher amount of Cd was reallocated to the new growth tissues under low Ca stress compared to plants supplied with sufficient Ca. These results suggest that Ca deficiency triggered a highly efficient phloem remobilization of Cd in <i>S. alfredii</i> and subsequently enhanced Cd accumulation in its young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es.</p>

Sucrose Transporter <i>ZmSut1</i> Expression and Localization Uncover New Insights into Sucrose Phloem Loading
<p>Sucrose transporters (SUTs) translocate sucrose (Suc) across cellular membranes, and in eudicots, multiple SUTs are known to function in Suc phloem loading in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. In maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), the <i>Sucrose Transporter1</i> (<i>ZmSut1</i>) gene has been implicated in Suc phloem loading based upon RNA expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, electrophysiological experiments, and phenotypic analysis of <i>zmsut1</i> mutant plants. However, no previous studies have examined the cellular expression of <i>ZmSut1</i> RNA or the subcellular localization of the ZmSUT1 protein to assess the gene’s hypothesized function in Suc phloem loading or to evaluate its potential roles, such as phloem unloading, in nonphotosynthetic tissues. To this end, we performed RNA in situ hybridization experiments, promoter-reporter gene analyses, and ZmSUT1 localization studies to elucidate the cellular expression pattern of the <i>ZmSut1</i> transcript and protein. These data showed that <i>ZmSut1</i> was expressed in multiple cell types throughout the plant and indicated that it functions in phloem companion cells to load Suc and also in other cell types to retrieve Suc from the apoplasm to prevent its accumulation and loss to the transpiration stream. Additionally, by comparing a phloem-mobile tracer with <i>ZmSut1</i> expression, we determined that developing maize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es dynamically switch from symplasmic to apoplasmic phloem unloading, reconciling previously conflicting reports, and suggest that <i>ZmSut1</i> does not have an apparent function in either unloading process. A model for the dual roles for <i>ZmSut1</i> function (phloem loading and apoplasmic recycling), <i>Sut1</i> evolution, and its possible use to enhance Suc export from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es in engineering C<sub>3</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is discussed.</p>

A 90,000-year record of Afromontane forest responses to climate change
<p>Pollen records from African highlands are scarce; hence, the paleoecology of the Afromontane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> and its responses to glacial cycles are poorly known.

Pollen data and biome reconstructions show a diverging response of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s to climate changes; the upper tree line was extremely unstable, shifting substantially in response to glacial-interglacial climate alternation, whereas the transition between the montane and lowland <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s remained remarkably stable.

Tropical forests are a net carbon source based on aboveground measurements of gain and loss
<p>The carbon balance of tropical ecosystems remains uncertain, with top-down atmospheric studies suggesting an overall sink and bottom-up ecological approaches indicating a modest net source. Here we use 12 years (2003 to 2014) of MODIS pantropical satellite data to quantify net annual changes in the aboveground carbon density of tropical woody live vegetation, providing direct, measurement-based evidence that the world’s tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s are a net carbon source of 425.2<bold> </bold>± 92.0 teragrams of carbon per year (Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>). This net release of carbon consists of losses of 861.7 ± 80.2 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup> and gains of 436.5 ± 31.0 Tg C year<sup>–1</sup>. Gains result from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> growth; losses result from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">de<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong></span></strong>ation and from reductions in carbon density within standing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s (degradation or disturbance), with the latter accounting for 68.9% of overall losses.</p>

Global climatic drivers of leaf size
<p>Leaf size varies by over a 100,000-fold among species worldwide. Although 19th-century plant geographers noted that the wet tropics harbor plants with exceptionally large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, the latitudinal gradient of leaf size has not been well quantified nor the key climatic drivers convincingly identified. Here, we characterize worldwide patterns in leaf size. Large-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>ed species predominate in wet, hot, sunny environments; small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>ed species typify hot, sunny environments only in arid conditions; small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es are also found in high latitudes and elevations. By modeling the balance of leaf energy inputs and outputs, we show that daytime and nighttime leaf-to-air temperature differences are key to geographic gradients in leaf size. This knowledge can enrich “next-generation” vegetation models in which leaf temperature and water use during photosynthesis play key roles.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Jasmone Hydroxylase, a Key Enzyme in the Synthesis of the Alcohol Moiety of Pyrethrin Insecticides
<p>Pyrethrins are synthesized by the plant pyrethrum (<i>Tanacetum cinerariifolium</i>), a chrysanthemum relative. These compounds possess efficient insecticidal properties and are not toxic to humans and most vertebrates. Pyrethrum flowers, and to a smaller extent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, synthesize six main types of pyrethrins, which are all esters of a monoterpenoid acid moiety and an alcohol moiety derived from jasmonic acid. Here, we identified and characterized the enzyme responsible for the conversion of jasmone, a derivative of jasmonic acid, to jasmolone. Feeding pyrethrum flowers with jasmone resulted in a 4-fold increase in the concentration of free jasmolone as well as smaller but significant proportional increases in free pyrethrolone and all three type I pyrethrins. We used floral transcriptomic data to identify cytochrome P450 genes whose expression patterns were most highly correlated with that of a key gene in pyrethrin biosynthesis, <i>T. cinerariifolium chrysanthemyl diphosphate synthase</i>. The candidate genes were screened for jasmone hydroxylase activity through transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es fed with jasmone. The expression of only one of these candidate genes produced jasmolone; therefore, this gene was named <i>T. cinerariifolium jasmolone hydroxylase</i> (<i>TcJMH</i>) and given the CYP designation CYP71AT148. The protein encoded by <i>TcJMH</i> localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, and microsomal preparations from <i>N. benthamiana</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es expressing <i>TcJMH</i> were capable of catalyzing the hydroxylation of jasmone to jasmolone in vitro, with a <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> value of 53.9 µ<sc>m</sc>. <i>TcJMH</i> was expressed almost exclusively in trichomes of floral ovaries and was induced in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es by jasmonate.</p>

SIAMESE-RELATED1 Is Regulated Posttranslationally and Participates in Repression of Leaf Growth under Moderate Drought
<p>The plant cell cycle is tightly regulated by factors that integrate endogenous cues and environmental signals to adapt plant growth to changing conditions. Under drought, cell division in young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es is blocked by an active mechanism, reducing the evaporative surface and conserving energy resources. The molecular function of cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins (CKIs) in regulating the cell cycle has already been well studied, but little is known about their involvement in cell cycle regulation under adverse growth conditions. In this study, we show that the transcript of the CKI gene <i>SIAMESE-RELATED1</i> (<i>SMR1</i>) is quickly induced under moderate drought in young Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Functional characterization further revealed that SMR1 inhibits cell division and affects meristem activity, thereby restricting the growth of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and roots. Moreover, we demonstrate that SMR1 is a short-lived protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome after being ubiquitinated by a Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consequently, overexpression of a more stable variant of the SMR1 protein leads to a much stronger phenotype than overexpression of the native SMR1. Under moderate drought, both the <i>SMR1</i> transcript and SMR1 protein accumulate. Despite this induction, <i>smr1</i> mutants do not show overall tolerance to drought stress but do show less growth inhibition of young <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es under drought. Surprisingly, the growth-repressive hormone ethylene promotes <i>SMR1</i> induction, but the classical drought hormone abscisic acid does not.</p>

SHORTROOT-Mediated Increase in Stomatal Density Has No Impact on Photosynthetic Efficiency
<p>The coordinated positioning of veins, mesophyll cells, and stomata across a leaf is crucial for efficient gas exchange and transpiration and, therefore, for overall function. In monocot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, stomatal cell files are positioned at the flanks of underlying longitudinal leaf veins, rather than directly above or below. This pattern suggests either that stomatal formation is inhibited in epidermal cells directly in contact with the vein or that specification is induced in cell files beyond the vein. The SHORTROOT pathway specifies distinct cell types around the vasculature in subepidermal layers of both root and shoots, with cell type identity determined by distance from the vein. To test whether the pathway has the potential to similarly pattern epidermal cell types, we expanded the expression domain of the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> ssp <i>japonica</i>) <i>OsSHR2</i> gene, which we show is restricted to developing leaf veins, to include bundle sheath cells encircling the vein. In transgenic lines, which were generated using the orthologous <i>ZmSHR1</i> gene to avoid potential silencing of <i>OsSHR2</i>, stomatal cell files were observed both in the normal position and in more distant positions from the vein. Contrary to theoretical predictions, and to phenotypes observed in eudicot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, the increase in stomatal density did not enhance photosynthetic capacity or increase mesophyll cell density. Collectively, these results suggest that the SHORTROOT pathway may coordinate the positioning of veins and stomata in monocot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and that distinct mechanisms may operate in monocot and eudicot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es to coordinate stomatal patterning with the development of underlying mesophyll cells.</p>

An Improved <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> Silencing Vector: Greater Insert Stability and More Extensive VIGS
<p>Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is used extensively for gene function studies in plants. VIGS is inexpensive and rapid compared with silencing conducted through stable transformation, but many virus-silencing vectors, especially in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es, induce only transient silencing phenotypes. A major reason for transient phenotypes is the instability of the foreign gene fragment (insert) in the vector during VIGS. Here, we report the development of a <i>Brome mosaic virus</i> (BMV)-based vector that better maintains inserts through modification of the original BMV vector RNA sequence. Modification of the BMV RNA3 sequence yielded a vector, BMVCP5, that better maintained <i>phytoene desaturase</i> and <i>heat shock protein70-1</i> (<i>HSP70-1</i>) inserts in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). Longer maintenance of inserts was correlated with greater target gene silencing and more extensive visible silencing phenotypes displaying greater tissue penetration and involving more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. The modified vector accumulated similarly to the original vector in <i>N. benthamiana</i> after agroinfiltration, thus maintaining a high titer of virus in this intermediate host used to produce virus inoculum for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> hosts. For <i>HSP70</i>, silencing one family member led to a large increase in the expression of another family member, an increase likely related to the target gene knockdown and not a general effect of virus infection. The cause of the increased insert stability in the modified vector is discussed in relationship to its recombination and accumulation potential. The modified vector will improve functional genomic studies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es, and the conceptual methods used to improve the vector may be applied to other VIGS vectors.</p>

Forever Young: The Role of Ubiquitin Receptor DA1 and E3 Ligase BIG BROTHER in Controlling Leaf Growth and Development
<p>The final size of plant organs is determined by a combination of cell proliferation and cell expansion. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es account for a large part of above-ground biomass and provide energy to complete the plant’s life cycle. Although the final size of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es is remarkably constant under fixed environmental conditions, several genes have been described to enhance leaf growth when their expression is modulated. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), mutations in <i>DA1</i> and <i>BB</i> increase leaf size, an effect that is synergistically enhanced in the double mutant. Here, we show that overexpression of a dominant-negative version of <i>DA1</i> enhances leaf size in a broad range of natural accessions of this species, indicating a highly conserved role of this protein in controlling organ size. We also found that during early stages of development, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of <i>da1-1</i> and <i>bb/eod1-2</i> mutants were already larger than the isogenic Col-0 wild type, but this phenotype was triggered by different cellular mechanisms. Later during development, <i>da1-1</i> and <i>bb/eod1-2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es showed a prolonged longevity, which was enhanced in the double mutant. Conversely, ectopic expression of <i>DA1</i> or <i>BB</i> restricted growth and promoted leaf senescence. In concert, shortly upon induction of <i>DA1</i> and <i>BB</i> expression, several marker genes for the transition from proliferation to expansion were highly up-regulated. Additionally, multiple genes involved in maintaining the mitotic cell cycle were rapidly down-regulated and senescence genes were strongly up-regulated, particularly upon <i>BB</i> induction. With these results, we demonstrate that DA1 and BB restrict leaf size and promote senescence through converging and different mechanisms.</p>

The Target of β-Expansin EXPB1 in Maize Cell Walls from Binding and Solid-State NMR Studies<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The wall-loosening actions of β-expansins are known primarily from studies of EXPB1 extracted from maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) pollen. EXPB1 selectively loosens cell walls (CWs) of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong>es, but its specific binding target is unknown. We characterized EXPB1 binding to sequentially extracted maize CWs, finding that the protein primarily binds glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX), the major matrix polysaccharide in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> CWs. This binding is strongly reduced by salts, indicating that it is predominantly electrostatic in nature. For direct molecular evidence of EXPB1 binding, we conducted solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which is sensitive to distances between unpaired electrons and nuclei. By mixing <sup>13</sup>C-enriched maize CWs with EXPB1 functionalized with a Mn<sup>2+</sup> tag, we measured Mn<sup>2+</sup>-induced PRE. Strong <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C PREs were observed for the carboxyls of GAX, followed by more moderate PREs for carboxyl groups in homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan-I, indicating that EXPB1 preferentially binds GAX. In contrast, no PRE was observed for cellulose, indicating very weak interaction of EXPB1 with cellulose. Dynamics experiments show that EXPB1 changes GAX mobility in a complex manner: the rigid fraction of GAX became more rigid upon EXPB1 binding while the dynamic fraction became more mobile. Combining these data with previous results, we propose that EXPB1 loosens <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> CWs by disrupting noncovalent junctions between highly substituted GAX and GAX of low substitution, which binds cellulose. This study provides molecular evidence of β-expansin’s target in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> CWs and demonstrates a new strategy for investigating ligand binding for proteins that are difficult to express heterologously.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and in intact <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Arabidopsis Responds to <i>Alternaria alternata</i> Volatiles by Triggering Plastid Phosphoglucose Isomerase-Independent Mechanisms
<p>Volatile compounds (VCs) emitted by phylogenetically diverse microorganisms (including plant pathogens and microbes that do not normally interact mutualistically with plants) promote photosynthesis, growth, and the accumulation of high levels of starch in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es through cytokinin (CK)-regulated processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants not exposed to VCs, plastidic phosphoglucose isomerase (pPGI) acts as an important determinant of photosynthesis and growth, likely as a consequence of its involvement in the synthesis of plastidic CKs in roots. Moreover, this enzyme plays an important role in connecting the Calvin-Benson cycle with the starch biosynthetic pathway in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in the responses of plants to microbial VCs and to investigate the extent of pPGI involvement, we characterized pPGI-null <i>pgi1-2</i> Arabidopsis plants cultured in the presence or absence of VCs emitted by <i>Alternaria alternata</i>. We found that volatile emissions from this fungal phytopathogen promote growth, photosynthesis, and the accumulation of plastidic CKs in <i>pgi1-2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Notably, the mesophyll cells of <i>pgi1-2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es accumulated exceptionally high levels of starch following VC exposure. Proteomic analyses revealed that VCs promote global changes in the expression of proteins involved in photosynthesis, starch metabolism, and growth that can account for the observed responses in <i>pgi1-2</i> plants. The overall data show that Arabidopsis plants can respond to VCs emitted by phytopathogenic microorganisms by triggering pPGI-independent mechanisms.</p>

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining variations in bunch number, the number of fruits per bunch and oil dry weight per fruit. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each plant on a daily basis from observations of the number of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ation and bunch ablation affected the bunch number and the fruit number per bunch. Variations in bunch number per month were mainly due to variations in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, variations in fruit number per bunch resulted both from changes in fruit-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">defoli</span></strong>ated plants, the decrease in the number of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain fruit weight and oil concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

Above- and belowground controls on water use by trees of different wood types in an eastern US deciduous forest
<p>Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above- and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (<i>D</i>). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2–2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased <i>D</i> as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below- and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions.</p>

Coordinating the overall stomatal response of plants: Rapid leaf-to-leaf communication during light stress
<p>The plant canopy functions as an aerial array of light-harvesting antennas. To achieve maximal yield, each leaf within this array and the array as a whole need to rapidly adjust to naturally occurring fluctuations in light intensity and quality. Excessive light stress triggers the closing of pores in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es called stomata to minimize moisture loss. We found that different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es within the canopy of an <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plant, including <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es not directly exposed to light, coordinated stomatal closure in response to light stress by sending and receiving rapid systemic signals. This response required the plant hormones abscisic acid and jasmonic acid and was mediated by a rapid autopropagating wave of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, this response depended on the function of genes encoding the ROS-generating NADPH oxidase RBOHD and various stomatal regulators, such as the anion channel SLAC1, GHR1 (guard cell hydrogen peroxide resistant 1), and lipoxygenase 1 (LOX1). Our findings reveal that plants function as highly dynamic and coordinated organisms, optimizing the overall response of their canopies to fluctuating light intensities.</p>

Airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy to map forest trait diversity and guide conservation
<p>Functional biogeography may bridge a gap between field-based biodiversity information and satellite-based Earth system studies, thereby supporting conservation plans to protect more species and their contributions to ecosystem functioning. We used airborne laser-guided imaging spectroscopy with environmental modeling to derive large-scale, multivariate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> canopy functional trait maps of the Peruvian Andes-to-Amazon biodiversity hotspot. Seven mapped canopy traits revealed functional variation in a geospatial pattern explained by geology, topography, hydrology, and climate. Clustering of canopy traits yielded a map of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> beta functional diversity for land-use analysis. Up to 53% of each mapped, functionally distinct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> presents an opportunity for new conservation action. Mapping functional diversity advances our understanding of the biosphere to conserve more biodiversity in the face of land use and climate change.</p>

Improving photosynthesis and crop productivity by accelerating recovery from photoprotection
<p>Crop <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es in full sunlight dissipate damaging excess absorbed light energy as heat. When sunlit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es are shaded by clouds or other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, this protective dissipation continues for many minutes and reduces photosynthesis. Calculations have shown that this could cost field crops up to 20% of their potential yield. Here, we describe the bioengineering of an accelerated response to natural shading events in <i>Nicotiana</i> (tobacco), resulting in increased leaf carbon dioxide uptake and plant dry matter productivity by about 15% in fluctuating light. Because the photoprotective mechanism that has been altered is common to all flowering plants and crops, the findings provide proof of concept for a route to obtaining a sustainable increase in productivity for food crops and a much-needed yield jump.</p>

Positive biodiversity-productivity relationship predominant in global forests
<p>The biodiversity-productivity relationship (BPR) is foundational to our understanding of the global extinction crisis and its impacts on ecosystem functioning. Understanding BPR is critical for the accurate valuation and effective conservation of biodiversity. Using ground-sourced data from 777,126 permanent plots, spanning 44 countries and most terrestrial biomes, we reveal a globally consistent positive concave-down BPR, showing that continued biodiversity loss would result in an accelerating decline in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> productivity worldwide. The value of biodiversity in maintaining commercial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> productivity alone—US$166 billion to 490 billion per year according to our estimation—is more than twice what it would cost to implement effective global conservation. This highlights the need for a worldwide reassessment of biodiversity values, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong> management strategies, and conservation priorities.</p>

Plant diversity patterns in neotropical dry forests and their conservation implications
<p>Seasonally dry tropical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s are distributed across Latin America and the Caribbean and are highly threatened, with less than 10% of their original extent remaining in many countries. Using 835 inventories covering 4660 species of woody plants, we show marked floristic turnover among inventories and regions, which may be higher than in other neotropical biomes, such as savanna. Such high floristic turnover indicates that numerous conservation areas across many countries will be needed to protect the full diversity of tropical dry <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">forest</span></strong>s.

Beyond Porosity: 3D Leaf Intercellular Airspace Traits That Impact Mesophyll Conductance
<p>The leaf intercellular airspace (IAS) is generally considered to have high conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion relative to the liquid phase. While previous studies accounted for leaf-level variation in porosity and mesophyll thickness, they omitted 3D IAS traits that potentially influence IAS conductance (g<sub>IAS</sub>). Here, we reevaluated the standard equation for g<sub>IAS</sub> by incorporating tortuosity, lateral path lengthening, and IAS connectivity. We measured and spatially mapped these geometric IAS traits for 19 Bromeliaceae species with Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) or C3 photosynthetic pathways using x-ray microcomputed tomography imaging and a novel computational approach. We found substantial variation in porosity (0.04–0.73 m<sup>3</sup> m<sup>−3</sup>), tortuosity (1.09–3.33 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>), lateral path lengthening (1.12–3.19 m m<sup>−1</sup>), and IAS connectivity (0.81–0.97 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>) across all bromeliad <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. The revised g<sub>IAS</sub> model predicted significantly lower g<sub>IAS</sub> in CAM (0.01–0.19 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) than in C3 (0.41–2.38 mol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>) plants due to a coordinated decline in these IAS traits. Our reevaluated equation also generally predicted lower g<sub>IAS</sub> values than the former one. Moreover, we observed high spatial heterogeneity in these IAS geometric traits throughout the mesophyll, especially within CAM <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Our data show that IAS traits that better capture the 3D complexity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es strongly influence g<sub>IAS</sub> and that the impact of the IAS on mesophyll conductance should be carefully considered with respect to leaf anatomy. We provide a simple function to estimate tortuosity and lateral path lengthening in the absence of access to imaging tools such as x-ray microcomputed tomography or other novel 3D image-processing techniques.</p>

Arabidopsis Leaf Flatness Is Regulated by PPD2 and NINJA through Repression of <i>CYCLIN D3</i> Genes
<p>In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), reduced expression of the transcriptional regulator <i>PEAPOD2</i> (<i>PPD2</i>) results in propeller-like rosettes with enlarged and dome-shaped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. However, the molecular and cellular processes underlying this peculiar phenotype remain elusive. Here, we studied the interaction between PPD2 and NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ (NINJA) and demonstrated that <i>ninja</i> loss-of-function plants produce rosettes with dome-shaped <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es similar to those of <i>ppd</i> mutants but without the increase in size. We showed that <i>ninja</i> mutants have a convex-shaped primary cell cycle arrest front, putatively leading to excessive cell division in the central leaf blade region. Furthermore, <i>ppd</i> and <i>ninja</i> mutants have a similar increase in the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;2</i> (<i>CYCD3;2</i>), and ectopic overexpression of <i>CYCD3;2</i> phenocopies the <i>ppd</i> and <i>ninja</i> rosette and leaf shape phenotypes without affecting the size. Our results reveal a pivotal contribution of NINJA in leaf development, in addition to its well-studied function in jasmonate signaling, and imply a new function for D3-type cyclins in, at least partially, uncoupling the size and shape phenotypes of <i>ppd</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es.</p>

<i>ELIGULUM-A</i> Regulates Lateral Branch and Leaf Development in Barley
<p>The shoot apical and axillary meristems control shoot development, effectively influencing lateral branch and leaf formation. The barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) <i>uniculm2</i> (<i>cul2</i>) mutation blocks axillary meristem development, and mutant plants lack lateral branches (tillers) that normally develop from the crown. A genetic screen for <i>cul2</i> suppressors recovered two recessive alleles of <i>ELIGULUM-A</i> (<i>ELI-A</i>) that partially rescued the <i>cul2</i> tillering phenotype. Mutations in <i>ELI-A</i> produce shorter plants with fewer tillers and disrupt the leaf blade-sheath boundary, producing liguleless <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and reduced secondary cell wall development in stems and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. <i>ELI-A</i> is predicted to encode an unannotated protein containing an RNaseH-like domain that is conserved in land plants. <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts accumulate at the preligule boundary, the developing ligule, leaf margins, cells destined to develop secondary cell walls, and cells surrounding leaf vascular bundles. Recent studies have identified regulatory similarities between boundary development in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and lateral organs. Interestingly, we observed <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the preligule boundary, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to boundary formation between the blade and sheath. However, we did not observe <i>ELI-A</i> transcripts at the axillary meristem boundary in leaf axils, suggesting that <i>ELI-A</i> is not involved in boundary development for axillary meristem development. Our results show that <i>ELI-A</i> contributes to leaf and lateral branch development by acting as a boundary gene during ligule development but not during lateral branch development.</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es can deposit one or more of the three major mineral types found in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these minerals and the control that the leaf exerts over mineral deposition, we investigated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the mineral locations in the soft tissues, the relative distributions of the minerals, and mineral volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D mineral distribution that is preserved in different environments. The mineral distribution patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light redistribution inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

Regulation of Sucrose Transporters and Phloem Loading in Response to Environmental Cues
<p>Suc transporters (SUTs) play a key role in the allocation and partitioning of photosynthetically fixed carbon in plants. While a function could be assigned to many members of the SUT family, almost no information is available on their regulation. Here, the transcriptional regulation of SUTs in response to various environmental stimuli in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of five dicots (Arabidopsis [<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>], soybean [<i>Glycine max</i>], potato [<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>], tomato [<i>Solanum</i> <i>lycopersicum</i>], and poplar [<i>Populus</i> spp.]) and four monocots (maize [<i>Zea</i> <i>mays</i>], rice [<i>Oryza sativa</i>], wheat [<i>Triticum aestivum</i>], and barley [<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>]) was investigated. Extensive data on expression of <i>SUT</i>s in relation to changes of environmental conditions were obtained through a global analysis of 168 transcriptomics data sets. Results were validated by quantitative PCR measurements and extended by the measurement of photosynthesis rate and phloem sugar content to draw insight on the correlation of <i>SUT</i> expression and sugar export from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. For the apoplasmic phloem loaders, a clear difference in transcriptional regulation in response to different environmental stimuli was observed. The consistent patterns of <i>SUT</i> expression under abiotic stress indicates which types of SUTs are involved in the regulation of leaf sugar status and in stress signaling. Furthermore, it is shown that down-regulation of phloem loading is likely to be caused by transcriptional regulation of SUTs, while up-regulation depends on post-transcriptional regulation. In poplar, expression of <i>PtaSUT4</i> was found to consistently respond to environmental stimuli, suggesting a significant role in the regulation of sugar export from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es in this passive symplasmic phloem loader.</p>

Altered Expression of a Malate-Permeable Anion Channel, OsALMT4, Disrupts Mineral Nutrition
<p>Aluminum-activated malate transporters (ALMTs) form a family of anion channels in plants, but little is known about most of its members. This study examined the function of <i>OsALMT4</i> from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). We show that <i>OsALMT4</i> is expressed in roots and shoots and that the OsALMT4 protein localizes to the plasma membrane. Transgenic rice lines overexpressing (OX) <i>OsALMT4</i> released malate from the roots constitutively and had 2-fold higher malate concentrations in the xylem sap than nulls, indicating greater concentrations of malate in the apoplast. OX lines developed brown necrotic spots on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es that did not appear on nulls. These symptoms were not associated with altered concentrations of any mineral element in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, although the OX lines had higher concentrations of Mn and B in their grain compared with nulls. While total leaf Mn concentrations were not different between the OX and null lines, Mn concentrations in the apoplast were greater in the OX plants. The OX lines also displayed increased expression of Mn transporters and were more sensitive to Mn toxicity than null plants. We showed that the growth of wild-type rice was unaffected by 100 µ<sc>m</sc> Mn in hydroponics but, when combined with 1 m<sc>m</sc> malate, this concentration inhibited growth. We conclude that increasing <i>OsALMT4</i> expression affected malate efflux and compartmentation within the tissues, which increased Mn concentrations in the apoplast of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es and induced the toxicity symptoms. This study reveals new links between malate transport and mineral nutrition.</p>

Sugar Potentiation of Fatty Acid and Triacylglycerol Accumulation
<p>Photosynthetically derived sugar provides carbon skeletons for lipid biosynthesis. We used mutants of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and the expression of oleogenic factors to investigate relationships among sugar availability, lipid synthesis, and the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in leaf tissue. The <i>adg1</i> mutation disables the small subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the first step in starch synthesis, and the <i>suc2</i> mutation disables a sucrose/proton symporter that facilitates sucrose loading from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es into phloem. The <i>adg1suc2</i> double mutant increases glucose plus sucrose content in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es 80-fold relative to the wild type, total fatty acid (FA) content 1.8-fold to 8.3% dry weight, and TAG more than 10-fold to 1.2% dry weight. The WRINKLED1 transcription factor also accumulates to higher levels in these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, and the rate of FA synthesis increases by 58%. Adding <i>tt4</i>, which disables chalcone synthase, had little effect, but adding the <i>tgd1</i> mutation, which disables an importer of lipids into plastids to create <i>adg1suc2tt4tgd1</i>, increased total leaf FA to 13.5% dry weight and TAG to 3.8% dry weight, demonstrating a synergistic effect upon combining these mutations. Combining <i>adg1suc2</i> with the <i>sdp1</i> mutation, deficient in the predominant TAG lipase, had little effect on total FA content but increased the TAG accumulation by 66% to 2% dry weight. Expression of the <i>WRINKLED1</i> transcription factor, along with <i>DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1</i> and the <i>OLEOSIN1</i> oil body-associated protein, in the <i>adg1suc2</i> mutant doubled leaf FA content and increased TAG content to 2.3% dry weight, a level 4.6-fold higher than that resulting from expression of the same factors in the wild type.</p>

Genetic Architecture and Molecular Networks Underlying Leaf Thickness in Desert-Adapted Tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i>
<p>Thicker <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es allow plants to grow in water-limited conditions. However, our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this highly functional leaf shape trait is poor. We used a custom-built confocal profilometer to directly measure leaf thickness in a set of introgression lines (ILs) derived from the desert tomato <i>Solanum pennellii</i> and identified quantitative trait loci. We report evidence of a complex genetic architecture of this trait and roles for both genetic and environmental factors. Several ILs with thick <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es have dramatically elongated palisade mesophyll cells and, in some cases, increased leaf ploidy. We characterized the thick IL2-5 and IL4-3 in detail and found increased mesophyll cell size and leaf ploidy levels, suggesting that endoreduplication underpins leaf thickness in tomato. Next, we queried the transcriptomes and inferred dynamic Bayesian networks of gene expression across early leaf ontogeny in these lines to compare the molecular networks that pattern leaf thickness. We show that thick ILs share <i>S. pennellii</i>-like expression profiles for putative regulators of cell shape and meristem determinacy as well as a general signature of cell cycle-related gene expression. However, our network data suggest that leaf thickness in these two lines is patterned at least partially by distinct mechanisms. Consistent with this hypothesis, double homozygote lines combining introgression segments from these two ILs show additive phenotypes, including thick <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, higher ploidy levels, and larger palisade mesophyll cells. Collectively, these data establish a framework of genetic, anatomical, and molecular mechanisms that pattern leaf thickness in desert-adapted tomato.</p>

Repression of CYSTATHIONINE <i>γ</i>-SYNTHASE in Seeds Recruits the <i>S</i>-Methylmethionine Cycle
<p><i>S</i>-Methylmethionine (SMM) was suggested previously to participate in the metabolism of methionine (Met) in seeds. To further reveal its roles, we had previously produced transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RNA interference (RNAi) seeds with lower transcript expression of CYSTATHIONINE γ-SYNTHASE (<i>AtCGS</i>), Met’s main regulatory enzyme. Unexpectedly, these seeds accumulated significantly higher levels of Met compared with control seeds through an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, transcript and metabolic analyses coupled with isotope-labeled [<sup>13</sup>C]SMM and [<sup>13</sup>C]Met feeding experiments enabled us to reveal that SMM that was synthesized in rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of RNAi plants significantly contributed to the accumulation of Met in their seeds at late stages of development. Seed-specific repression of <i>AtCGS</i> in RNAi seeds triggered the induction of genes operating in the SMM cycle of rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, leading to elevated transport of SMM toward the seeds, where higher reconversion rates of SMM to Met were detected. The metabolic rearrangements in RNAi seeds resulted in an altered sulfur-associated metabolism, such as lower amounts of Cys and glutathione, as well as a differential composition of glucosinolates. Together, the data propose a novel cross talk existing between seeds and rosette <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es along with mutual effects between the Asp family and SMM pathways operating in these tissues. They also shed light on the effects of higher Met levels on seed physiology and behavior.</p>

Acyl-CoA:Lysophosphatidylethanolamine Acyltransferase Activity Regulates Growth of Arabidopsis
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains two enzymes (encoded by the <i>At1g80950</i> and <i>At2g45670</i> genes) preferentially acylating lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) with acyl-coenzyme A (CoA), designated LYSOPHOSPHATIDYLETHANOLAMINE ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (LPEAT1) and LPEAT2. The transfer DNA insertion mutant lpeat2 and the double mutant lpeat1 lpeat2 showed impaired growth, smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es, shorter roots, less seed setting, and reduced lipid content per fresh weight in roots and seeds and large increases in LPE and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) contents in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. Microsomal preparations from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of these mutants showed around 70% decrease in acylation activity of LPE with 16:0-CoA compared with wild-type membranes, whereas the acylation with 18:1-CoA was much less affected, demonstrating that other lysophospholipid acyltransferases than the two LPEATs could acylate LPE. The above-mentioned effects were less pronounced in the single lpeat1 mutant. Overexpression of either LPEAT1 or LPEAT2 under the control of the 35S promotor led to morphological changes opposite to what was seen in the transfer DNA mutants. Acyl specificity studies showed that LPEAT1 utilized 16:0-CoA at the highest rate of 11 tested acyl-CoAs, whereas LPEAT2 utilized 20:0-CoA as the best acyl donor. Both LPEATs could acylate either <i>sn</i> position of ether analogs of LPC. The data show that the activities of LPEAT1 and LPEAT2 are, in a complementary way, involved in growth regulation in Arabidopsis. It is shown that LPEAT activity (especially LPEAT2) is essential for maintaining adequate levels of phosphatidylethanolamine, LPE, and LPC in the cells.</p>

To begin dissecting the molecular changes that led to the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in this group, the complementary DNAs encoding four distinct β-carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoforms were characterized from leaf tissue of <i>Neurachne munroi</i> (C<sub>4</sub>), <i>Neurachne minor</i> (C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub>), and <i>Neurachne alopecuroidea</i> (C<sub>3</sub>). Two genes (<i>CA1</i> and <i>CA2</i>) each encode two different isoforms: CA1a/CA1b and CA2a/CA2b. Transcript analyses found that <i>CA1</i> messenger RNAs were significantly more abundant than transcripts from the <i>CA2</i> gene in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es of each species examined, constituting ∼99% of all β-CA transcripts measured. Localization experiments using green fluorescent protein fusion constructs showed that, while CA1b is a cytosolic CA in all three species, the CA1a proteins are differentially localized. The <i>N. alopecuroidea</i> and <i>N. minor</i> CA1a isoforms were imported into chloroplasts of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf cells, whereas <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a localized to the cytosol. Sequence analysis indicated an 11-amino acid deletion in the amino terminus of <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a relative to the C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> proteins, suggesting that chloroplast targeting of CA1a is the ancestral state and that loss of a functional chloroplast transit peptide in <i>N. munroi</i> CA1a is associated with the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis in <i>Neurachne</i> spp. Remarkably, this mechanism is homoplastic with the evolution of the C<sub>4</sub>-associated CA in the dicotyledonous genus <i>Flaveria</i>, although the actual mutations in the two lineages differ.</p>

The Thiamine Biosynthesis Gene <i>THI1</i> Promotes Nodule Growth and Seed Maturation
<p>Thiamine (vitamin B1) is essential for living organisms. Unlike animals, plants can synthesize thiamine. In <i>Lotus japonicus</i>, the expression of two thiamine biosynthesis genes, <i>THI1</i> and <i>THIC</i>, was enhanced by inoculation with rhizobia but not by inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. <i>THIC</i> and <i>THI2</i> (a <i>THI1</i> paralog) were expressed in uninoculated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. <i>THI2</i>-knockdown plants and the transposon insertion mutant <i>thiC</i> had chlorotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es. This typical phenotype of thiamine deficiency was rescued by an exogenous supply of thiamine. In wild-type plants, <i>THI1</i> was expressed mainly in roots and nodules, and the <i>thi1</i> mutant had green <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">leav</span></strong>es even in the absence of exogenous thiamine. <i>THI1</i> was highly expressed in actively dividing cells of nodule primordia. The <i>thi1</i> mutant had small nodules, and this phenotype was rescued by exogenous thiamine and by <i>THI1</i> complementation. Exogenous thiamine increased nodule diameter, but the level of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization was unaffected in the <i>thi1</i> mutant or by exogenous thiamine. Expression of symbiotic marker genes was induced normally, implying that mainly nodule growth was delayed in the <i>thi1</i> mutant. Furthermore, this mutant formed many immature seeds with reduced seed weight. These results indicate that thiamine biosynthesis mediated by THI1 enhances nodule enlargement and is required for seed development in <i>L. japonicus</i>.</p>

Convergence in morphology and masticatory function between the pharyngeal jaws of grass carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, and oral jaws of amniote herbivores
<p>The cellulose-rich walls that protect plant cells are difficult to digest, and therefore mechanical food processing is a key aspect of herbivory across vertebrates. Cell walls are typically broken down by translation of flattened teeth in the occlusal plane (i.e. grinding) as part of a complex, rhythmic chewing stroke. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> carp, <i>Ctenopharyngodon idella</i>, is a voracious, invasive herbivorous fish that relies solely on its pharyngeal teeth, located in the back of the throat, for mechanical processing of plant material. Here, we describe the musculoskeletal anatomy of the pharyngeal jaws of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> carp and use XROMM to quantify chewing kinematics and muscle strain. The pharyngeal jaws are suspended in a sling of 11 muscles and maintain no bony articulation with any other skeletal elements in the head. The jaws bear long, serrated teeth that are worn during use into flattened tooth cusps. Our kinematic data show that this wear is the result of the teeth being elevated into occlusion against the basioccipital process and keratinous chewing pad, not tooth-on-tooth occlusion. Pharyngeal jaw elevation results from large strains in the jaw elevator muscle, the levator arcus branchialis V, to drive a pulley-like mechanism that rotates the jaws about a pivot point at the symphysis between the left and right pharyngeal jaws. These complex, rhythmic jaw rotations translate the teeth laterally across the chewing surface throughout the occlusion phase. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">grass</span></strong> carp chewing system is strikingly similar in gross morphology and masticatory function to herbivorous chewing strategies in other vertebrates.</p>

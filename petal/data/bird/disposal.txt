Preferential Distribution of Boron to Developing Tissues Is Mediated by the Intrinsic Protein OsNIP3
<p>Boron is especially required for the growth of meristem and reproductive organs, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of B to these developing tissues are poorly understood. Here, we show evidence that a member of nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP), OsNIP3;1, is involved in this preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). <i>OsNIP3</i>;<i>1</i> was highly expressed in the nodes and its expression was up-regulated by B deficiency, but down-regulated by high B. OsNIP3;1 was polarly localized at the xylem parenchyma cells of enlarged vascular bundles of nodes facing toward the xylem vessels. Furthermore, this protein was rapidly degraded within a few hours in response to high B. Knockout of this gene hardly affected the uptake and root-to-shoot translocation of B, but altered B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion in different organs in the above-ground parts, decreased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of B to the new leaves, and increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion to the old leaves. These results indicate that OsNIP3;1 located in the nodes is involved in the preferential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of B to the developing tissues by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing B from the xylem in rice and that it is regulated at both transcriptional and protein level in response to external B level.</p>

RopGEF1 Plays a Critical Role in Polar Auxin Transport in Early Development
<p>Polar auxin transport, facilitated by the combined activities of auxin influx and efflux carriers to maintain asymmetric auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion, is essential for plant growth and development. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>RopGEF1</i>, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor and activator of Rho GTPases of plants (ROPs), is critically involved in polar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of auxin influx carrier AUX1 and differential accumulation of efflux carriers PIN7 and PIN2 and is important for embryo and early seedling development when RopGEF1 is prevalently expressed. Knockdown or knockout of <i>RopGEF1</i> induces embryo defects, cotyledon vein breaks, and delayed root gravity responses. Altered expression from the auxin response reporter <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in the root pole of <i>RopGEF1</i>-deficient embryos and loss of asymmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of <i>DR5rev:GFP</i> in their gravistimulated root tips suggest that auxin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion is affected in <i>ropgef1</i> mutants. This is reflected by the polarity of AUX1 being altered in <i>ropgef1</i> embryos and roots, shifting from the normal apical membrane location to a basal location in embryo central vascular and root protophloem cells and also reduced PIN7 accumulation at embryos and altered PIN2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion in gravistimulated roots of mutant seedlings. In establishing that RopGEF1 is critical for AUX1 localization and PIN differential accumulation, our results reveal a role for RopGEF1 in cell polarity and polar auxin transport whereby it imapcts auxin-mediated plant growth and development.</p>

Storage Compartments for Capillary Water Rarely Refill in an Intact Woody Plant
<p>Water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e is thought to play an integral role in the maintenance of whole-plant water balance. The contribution of both living and dead cells to water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e can be derived from rehydration and water-release curves on excised plant material, but the underlying tissue-specific emptying/refilling dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used x-ray computed microtomography to characterize the refilling of xylem fibers, pith cells, and vessels under both excised and in vivo conditions in <i>Laurus nobilis</i>. In excised stems supplied with water, water uptake exhibited a biphasic response curve, and x-ray computed microtomography images showed that high water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e capacitance was associated with fiber and pith refilling as driven by capillary forces: fibers refilled more rapidly than pith cells, while vessel refilling was minimal. In excised stems that were sealed, fiber and pith refilling was associated with vessel emptying, indicating a link between tissue connectivity and water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e. In contrast, refilling of fibers, pith cells, and vessels was negligible in intact saplings over two time scales, 24 h and 3 weeks. However, those compartments did refill slowly when the shoot was covered to prevent transpiration. Collectively, our data (1) provide direct evidence that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e compartments for capillary water refill in excised stems but rarely under in vivo conditions, (2) highlight that estimates of capacitance from excised samples should be interpreted with caution, as certain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e compartments may not be utilized in the intact plant, and (3) question the paradigm that fibers play a substantial role in daily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e/recharge of stem capacitance in an intact tree.</p>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision   arthroplasty surgery.

Laminins containing the β2 and γ3 chains regulate astrocyte migration and angiogenesis in the retina
<p>Pathologies of retinal blood vessels are among the major causes of blindness worldwide. A key cell type that regulates retinal vascular development is the astrocyte. Generated extrinsically to the retina, astrocytes migrate into the retina through the optic nerve head. Even though there is a strong correlation between astrocyte <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion and retinal vascular development, the factors that guide astrocytes into the retina remain unclear. In this study, we show that astrocytes migrate within a laminin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing basement membrane - the inner limiting membrane. Genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion of the laminin β2 and γ3 chains affects astrocyte migration and spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion. We show that laminins act as haptotactic factors <i>in vitro</i> in an isoform-specific manner, inducing astrocyte migration and promoting astrocyte differentiation. The addition of exogenous laminins to laminin-null retinal explants rescues astrocyte migration and spatial patterning. Furthermore, we show that the loss of laminins reduces β1 integrin expression in astrocytes. Culturing laminin-null retinal astrocytes on laminin substrates restores focal localization of β1 integrin. Finally, we show that laminins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing β2 and γ3 chains regulate subsequent retinal blood vessel growth and maintain vascular integrity. These <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> studies demonstrate clearly that laminins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing β2 and γ3 chains are indispensable for migration and spatial organization of astrocytes and that they play a crucial role during retinal angiogenesis <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

The epigenetic landscape of T cell exhaustion
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ed T cells in cancer and chronic viral infection express distinctive patterns of genes, including sustained expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). However, the regulation of gene expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ed T cells is poorly understood. Here, we define the accessible chromatin landscape in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ed CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and show that it is distinct from functional memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ed CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in humans and a mouse model of chronic viral infection acquire a state-specific epigenetic landscape organized into functional modules of enhancers. Genome editing shows that PD-1 expression is regulated in part by an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion-specific enhancer that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s essential RAR, T-bet, and Sox3 motifs. Functional enhancer maps may offer targets for genome editing that alter gene expression preferentially in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ed CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

Can T cells be too exhausted to fight back?
<p>When T cells are persistently activated by antigen, such as during chronic infection or in cancer, they can become functionally incapable of performing their effector activities, a condition called T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion therefore thwarts optimal immune control of infection and tumors. There is a need to learn more about the molecular factors that drive T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion and just how malleable T cell immunity is once <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion is established. On pages 1165 and 1160 of this issue, Sen <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) and Pauken <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>), respectively, demonstrate that T cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion represents a stable differentiation state, underpinned by the apparently irreversible installation of an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ion-specific genetic landscape. This implies that perhaps in a majority of cases of persistent immune activation, T cells are too <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">exhaust</span></strong>ed to fight back against cancer or pathogens.</p>

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ates to individually evaluate the effects of the host gene-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ate, but for other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ates showed that the effect of some interactions could be masked or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene interactions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e dynamics is challenging because NSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e pools are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong> organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>ed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion pathway.</p>

Association Between Duration of Resuscitation and Favorable Outcome After Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest

Primary exposure was duration of resuscitation in minutes (onset of professional resuscitation to return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC] or termination of resuscitation). Primary outcome was survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale [mRS] score of 0–3).

Continental Diversification of an African Catfish Radiation (Mochokidae: <i>Synodontis</i>)
<p>Despite African rivers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing high species diversity, continental-scale studies investigating the mechanisms generating biological diversity of African riverine faunas are limited compared with lacustrine systems. To investigate the build-up of diversity in a tropical aquatic continental radiation, we test different models of lineage diversification and reconstruct the biogeographic history in a species-rich siluriform genus, <i>Synodontis</i> (~130 species), with a broad <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion across all major tropical African drainage basins. The resulting robust species-level phylogeny (~60% complete, based on a multigene data set) exhibits a near constant rate of lineage accumulation throughout the mid-Cenozoic to recent, irrespective of missing species and despite the changing environmental conditions that were prevalent during this time period. This pattern contrasts with the findings for species-level diversification of large clades that commonly show an early burst of cladogenesis followed by declining rates through time. The identification of distinct biogeographic clades demonstrates a correlation between river hydrology and cladogenesis, although there is evidence of recent repeat <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dispers</span></strong>al into the southern range of the focal group. We conclude that diverse freshwater fish radiations with tropical continental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ions represent important organisms to test hypotheses of diversification and investigate the effects of palaeo-landscapes and climates on present day biodiversity.

The LKB1–AMPK-α1 signaling pathway triggers hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction downstream of mitochondria
<p>Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), which aids ventilation-perfusion matching in the lungs, is triggered by mechanisms intrinsic to pulmonary arterial smooth muscles. The unique sensitivity of these muscles to hypoxia is conferred by mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 2, the inhibition of which has been proposed to trigger HPV through increased generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Contrary to this model, we have shown that the LKB1–AMPK-α1 signaling pathway is critical to HPV. Spectral Doppler ultrasound revealed that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion of the AMPK-α1 catalytic subunit blocked HPV in mice during mild (8% O<sub>2</sub>) and severe (5% O<sub>2</sub>) hypoxia, whereas AMPK-α2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion attenuated HPV only during severe hypoxia. By contrast, neither of these genetic manipulations affected serotonin-induced reductions in pulmonary vascular flow. HPV was also attenuated by reduced expression of LKB1, a kinase that activates AMPK during energy stress, but not after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion of CaMKK2, a kinase that activates AMPK in response to increases in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Fluorescence imaging of acutely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ated pulmonary arterial myocytes revealed that AMPK-α1 or AMPK-α2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion did not affect mitochondrial membrane potential during normoxia or hypoxia. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion of AMPK-α1, but not of AMPK-α2, blocked hypoxia from inhibiting K<sub>V</sub>1.5, the classical “oxygen-sensing” K<sup>+</sup> channel in pulmonary arterial myocytes. We conclude that LKB1–AMPK-α1 signaling pathways downstream of mitochondria are critical for the induction of HPV, in a manner also supported by AMPK-α2 during severe hypoxia.</p>

Based on this concept, one would expect that water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e compartments involved in the buffering of xylem tensions empty before the onset of vessel cavitation under drought stress, and potentially refill after soil saturation. However, scant in vivo data exist that elucidate this localized spatiotemporal coupling. In this study on intact saplings of American chestnut (<i>Castanea dentata</i>), x-ray computed microtomography (microCT) showed that the xylem matrix surrounding vessels releases stored water and becomes air-filled either concurrent to or after vessel cavitation under progressive drought stress. Among annual growth rings, the xylem matrix of the current year remained largely water-filled even under severe drought stress. In comparison, microtomography images collected on excised stems showed that applied pressures of much greater than 0 MPa were required to induce water release from the xylem matrix. Viability staining highlighted that water release from the xylem matrix was associated primarily with emptying of dead fibers. Refilling of the xylem matrix and vessels was detected in intact saplings when the canopy was bagged and stem water potential was close to 0 MPa, and in leafless saplings over the winter period. In conclusion, this study indicates that the bulk of water stored in the xylem matrix is released after the onset of vessel cavitation, and suggests that capillary water contributes to overall stem water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e under drought but is not used primarily for the prevention of drought-induced vessel cavitation in this species.</p>

Synaptotagmin-Associated Endoplasmic Reticulum-Plasma Membrane Contact Sites Are Localized to Immobile ER Tubules
<p>The plant endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is morphologically divided into tubules and sheets, seems to flow continuously as a whole, but locally, mobile and immobile regions exist. In eukaryotes, the ER physically and functionally interacts with the plasma membrane (PM) at domains called ER-PM contact sites (EPCSs). Extended synaptotagmin family proteins are concentrated in the cortical ER to form one type of EPCS; however, it is unclear whether the localization of extended synaptotagmin corresponds to the EPCS and where in the cortical ER the EPCSs are formed. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal localization of SYNAPTOTAGMIN1 (SYT1), a synaptotagmin in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), to investigate the precise <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of SYT1-associated EPCSs in the cortical ER. Three-dimensional imaging using superresolution confocal live imaging microscopy demonstrated that SYT1 was specifically localized to the ER-PM boundary. Time-lapse imaging revealed that SYT1 was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ed to immobile ER tubules, but not to mobile tubules. Moreover, SYT1 was frequently localized to the edges of ER sheets that were transformed into immobile ER tubules over time. A lower intracellular calcium ion concentration resulted in an increased EPCS area and disrupted the ER network. Finally, SYT1 deficiency caused a reduction of the immobile tubules and enlargement of the ER meshes. Taken together, our findings show that SYT1-associated EPCS are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ed to immobile tubules and play an important role in the formation of the tubular ER network. This provides important insight into the relationship between the function and dynamics/morphology of the cortical ER.</p>

Mineral Deposits in <i>Ficus</i> Leaves: Morphologies and Locations in Relation to Function
<p><i>Ficus</i> trees are adapted to diverse environments and have some of the highest rates of photosynthesis among trees. <i>Ficus</i> leaves can deposit one or more of the three major mineral types found in leaves: amorphous calcium carbonate cystoliths, calcium oxalates, and silica phytoliths. In order to better understand the functions of these minerals and the control that the leaf exerts over mineral deposition, we investigated leaves from 10 <i>Ficus</i> species from vastly different environments (Rehovot, Israel; Bologna, Italy; Issa Valley, Tanzania; and Ngogo, Uganda). We identified the mineral locations in the soft tissues, the relative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ions of the minerals, and mineral volume contents using microcomputed tomography. Each <i>Ficus</i> species is characterized by a unique 3D mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion that is preserved in different environments. The mineral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion patterns are generally different on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the leaf. All species examined have abundant calcium oxalate deposits around the veins. We used micromodulated fluorimetry to examine the effect of cystoliths on photosynthetic efficiency in two species having cystoliths abaxially and adaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>microcarpa</i>) or only abaxially (<i>Ficus</i> <i>carica</i>). In <i>F. microcarpa</i>, both adaxial and abaxial cystoliths efficiently contributed to light re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion inside the leaf and, hence, increased photosynthetic efficiency, whereas in <i>F. carica</i>, the abaxial cystoliths did not increase photosynthetic efficiency.</p>

Chlorophyll Can Be Reduced in Crop Canopies with Little Penalty to Photosynthesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>The hypothesis that reducing chlorophyll content (Chl) can increase canopy photosynthesis in soybeans was tested using an advanced model of canopy photosynthesis. The relationship among leaf Chl, leaf optical properties, and photosynthetic biochemical capacity was measured in 67 soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) accessions showing large variation in leaf Chl. These relationships were integrated into a biophysical model of canopy-scale photosynthesis to simulate the intercanopy light environment and carbon assimilation capacity of canopies with wild type, a Chl-deficient mutant (<i>Y11y11</i>), and 67 other mutants spanning the extremes of Chl to quantify the impact of variation in leaf-level Chl on canopy-scale photosynthetic assimilation and identify possible opportunities for improving canopy photosynthesis through Chl reduction. These simulations demonstrate that canopy photosynthesis should not increase with Chl reduction due to increases in leaf reflectance and nonoptimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of canopy nitrogen. However, similar rates of canopy photosynthesis can be maintained with a 9% savings in leaf nitrogen resulting from decreased Chl. Additionally, analysis of these simulations indicate that the inability of Chl reductions to increase photosynthesis arises primarily from the connection between Chl and leaf reflectance and secondarily from the mismatch between the vertical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of leaf nitrogen and the light absorption profile. These simulations suggest that future work should explore the possibility of using reduced Chl to improve canopy performance by adapting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of the “saved” nitrogen within the canopy to take greater advantage of the more deeply penetrating light.</p>

Gradually Decreasing Starch Branching Enzyme Expression Is Responsible for the Formation of Heterogeneous Starch Granules
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) endosperm is mainly occupied by homogeneous polygonal starch from inside to outside. However, morphologically different (heterogeneous) starches have been identified in some rice mutants. How these heterogeneous starches form remains unknown. A high-amylose rice line (TRS) generated through the antisense inhibition of <i>starch branching synthase I</i> (<i>SBEI</i>) and <i>SBEIIb</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s four heterogeneous starches: polygonal, aggregate, elongated, and hollow starch; these starches are regionally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ed in the endosperm from inside to outside. Here, we investigated the relationship between SBE dosage and the morphological architecture of heterogeneous starches in TRS endosperm from the view of the molecular structure of starch. The results indicated that their molecular structures underwent regular changes, including gradually increasing true amylose content but decreasing amylopectin content and gradually increasing the ratio of amylopectin long chain but decreasing the ratio of amylopectin short chain. Granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) amounts in the four heterogeneous starches were not significantly different from each other, but SBEI, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb showed a gradually decreasing trend. Further immunostaining analysis revealed that the gradually decreasing SBEs acting on the formation of the four heterogeneous granules were mainly due to the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of the three SBEs in the endosperm. It was suggested that the decreased amylopectin in starch might <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">remov</span></strong>e steric hindrance and provide extra space for abundant amylose accumulation when the GBSSI amount was not elevated. Furthermore, extra amylose coupled with altered amylopectin structure possibly led to morphological changes in heterogeneous granules.</p>

Spatial and Temporal Mapping of Key Lipid Species in <i>Brassica napus</i> Seeds
<p>The regulation of lipid synthesis in oil seeds is still not fully understood. Oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) is the third most productive vegetable oil crop on the global market; therefore, increasing our understanding of lipid accumulation in oilseed rape seeds is of great economic, as well as intellectual, importance. Matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a technique that allows the mapping of metabolites directly onto intact biological tissues, giving a spatial context to metabolism. We have used MALDI-MSI to study the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of two major lipid species, triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. A dramatic, heterogenous landscape of molecular species was revealed, demonstrating significantly different lipid compositions between the various tissue types within the seed. The embryonic axis was found to be particularly enriched in palmitic acid, while the seed coat/aleurone layer accumulated vaccenic, linoleic, and α-linoleic acids. Furthermore, the lipid composition of the inner and outer cotyledons differed from each other, a remarkable discovery given the supposed identical functionality of these two tissues. Triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion was analyzed through a developmental time series covering early seed lipid accumulation to seed maturity. The spatial patterning of lipid molecular species did not vary significantly during seed development. Data gathered using MALDI-MSI was verified through gas chromatography analysis of dissected seeds. The distinct lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion profiles observed imply differential regulation of lipid metabolism between the different tissue types of the seed. Further understanding of this differential regulation will enhance efforts to improve oilseed rape productivity and quality.</p>

Sucrose Transporter Localization and Function in Phloem Unloading in Developing Stems
<p>How sucrose transporters (SUTs) regulate phloem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing in monocot stems is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high Suc concentrations. To this end, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> SUTs SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 were characterized by determining their transport properties heterologously expressed in yeast or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and their in planta cellular and subcellular localization. The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong selectivity for Suc and high Suc affinities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at pH 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc affinity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and pH. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc affinity was independent of membrane potential and pH but supported high transport rates at neutral pH. Suc transport by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using yeast or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to sieve elements, while for elongating and recently elongated internodes, SUTs also were detected in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing from de-energized protophloem sieve elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of elongating and recently elongated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to release Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into metaphloem sieve elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing by bulk flow.</p>

FUBAR: A Fast, Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation for Inferring Selection
<p>Model-based analyses of natural selection often categorize sites into a relatively small number of site classes. Forcing each site to belong to one of these classes places unrealistic constraints on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of selection parameters, which can result in misleading inference due to model misspecification. We present an approximate hierarchical Bayesian method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine that ensures robustness against model misspecification by averaging over a large number of predefined site classes. This leaves the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of selection parameters essentially unconstrained, and also allows sites experiencing positive and purifying selection to be identified orders of magnitude faster than by existing methods. We demonstrate that popular random effects likelihood methods can produce misleading results when sites assigned to the same site class experience different levels of positive or purifying selection—an unavoidable scenario when using a small number of site classes. Our Fast Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation (FUBAR) is unaffected by this problem, while achieving higher power than existing unconstrained (fixed effects likelihood) methods. The speed advantage of FUBAR allows us to analyze larger data sets than other methods: We illustrate this on a large influenza hemagglutinin data set (3,142 sequences). FUBAR is available as a batch file within the latest HyPhy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion (<ext-link>http://www.hyphy.org</ext-link>), as well as on the Datamonkey web server (<ext-link>http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>).</p>

Impact of Bystander Automated External Defibrillator Use on Survival and Functional Outcomes in Shockable Observed Public Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Survival following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with shockable rhythms can be improved with early defibrillation. Although shockable OHCA accounts for only ≈25% of overall arrests, ≈60% of public OHCAs are shockable, offering the possibility of restoring thousands of individuals to full recovery with early defibrillation by bystanders. We sought to determine the association of bystander automated external defibrillator use with survival and functional outcomes in shockable observed public OHCA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>From 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium prospectively collected detailed information on all cardiac arrests at 9 regional centers. The exposures were shock administration by a bystander-applied automated external defibrillator in comparison with initial defibrillation by emergency medical services. The primary outcome measure was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with normal or near-normal (favorable) functional status defined as a modified Rankin Score ≤2. Survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e was the secondary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 49 555 OHCAs, 4115 (8.3%) observed public OHCAs were analyzed, of which 2500 (60.8%) were shockable. A bystander shock was applied in 18.8% of the shockable arrests. Patients shocked by a bystander were significantly more likely to survive to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e (66.5% versus 43.0%) and be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed with favorable functional outcome (57.1% versus 32.7%) than patients initially shocked by emergency medical services. After adjusting for known predictors of outcome, the odds ratio associated with a bystander shock was 2.62 (95% confidence interval, 2.07–3.31) for survival to hospital <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e and 2.73 (95% confidence interval, 2.17–3.44) for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e with favorable functional outcome. The benefit of bystander shock increased progressively as emergency medical services response time became longer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Bystander automated external defibrillator use before emergency medical services arrival in shockable observed public OHCA was associated with better survival and functional outcomes. Continued emphasis on public automated external defibrillator utilization programs may further improve outcomes of OHCA.</p></sec>

Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-system structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-system. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-system remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-system components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-system density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction increases during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing (<i>P</i><0.01). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-system density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-system density versus cells with high t-system density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-system in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Our results suggest that the remodeled t-system impairs excitation-contraction coupling and functional recovery during chronic LVAD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">unload</span></strong>ing.

Tetraspanin microdomains control localized protein kinase C signaling in B cells
<p>Activation of B cells by the binding of antigens to the B cell receptor (BCR) requires the protein kinase C (PKC) family member PKCβ. Because PKCs must translocate to the plasma membrane to become activated, we investigated the mechanisms regulating their spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion in mouse and human B cells. Through live-cell imaging, we showed that BCR-stimulated production of the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) resulted in the translocation of PKCβ from the cytosol to plasma membrane regions <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing the tetraspanin protein CD53. CD53 was specifically enriched at sites of BCR signaling, suggesting that BCR-dependent PKC signaling was initiated at these tetraspanin microdomains. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy studies confirmed the molecular recruitment of PKC to CD53-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing microdomains, which required the amino terminus of CD53. Furthermore, we showed that <i>Cd53</i>-deficient B cells were defective in the phosphorylation of PKC substrates. Consistent with this finding, PKC recruitment to the plasma membrane was impaired in both mouse and human <i>CD53</i>-deficient B cells compared to that in their wild-type counterparts. These data suggest that CD53 promotes BCR-dependent PKC signaling by recruiting PKC to the plasma membrane so that it can phosphorylate its substrates and that tetraspanin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing microdomains can act as signaling hotspots in the plasma membrane.</p>

Arc-continent collisions in the tropics set Earth’s climate state

Some 3300 people received the vaccine, which is still experimental and was given in a clinical trial. But the trial did not have a control group, so it will not be possible to assess the precise role, if any, it played in stopping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>. Then again, no one who received the vaccine developed the disease as of yet, and researchers noted that simply providing it helped with Ebola education.</p>

Biological uptake and reversible scavenging of zinc in the global ocean

The distinction between organic and adsorbed Zn can also reconcile the vertical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion and mass balance of Zn isotopes, which previously appeared at odds. This holistic understanding explains the Zn deficiencies observed throughout the low-latitude ocean and implies a greater sensitivity of the marine Zn cycle to climate-driven changes in organic matter cycling than previously recognized.</p>

Random heteropolymers preserve protein function in foreign environments
<p>The successful incorporation of active proteins into synthetic polymers could lead to a new class of materials with functions found only in living systems. However, proteins rarely function under the conditions suitable for polymer processing.

The spread of true and false news online
<p>We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong> of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong>s more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spread</span></strong> it.</p>

Hydrolytically stable fluorinated metal-organic frameworks for energy-efficient dehydration
<p>Natural gas must be dehydrated before it can be transported and used, but conventional drying agents such as activated alumina or inorganic molecular sieves require an energy-intensive desiccant-regeneration step. We report a hydrolytically stable fluorinated metal-organic framework, AlFFIVE-1-Ni (KAUST-8), with a periodic array of open metal coordination sites and fluorine moieties within the contracted square-shaped one-dimensional channel. This material selectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">remov</span></strong>ed water vapor from gas streams <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and higher hydrocarbons typical of natural gas, as well as selectively <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">remov</span></strong>ed both H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> in N<sub>2</sub>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing streams.

Micro Imaging Displays the Sucrose Landscape within and along Its Allocation Pathways
<p>Sucrose (Suc) is the major transport sugar in plants and plays a primary role as an energy source and signal in adaptive and stress responses. An ability to quantify Suc over time and space would serve to advance our understanding of these important processes. Current technologies used for Suc mapping are unable to quantitatively visualize its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion within tissues. Here, we present an infrared-based microspectroscopic method that allows for the quantitative visualization of Suc at a microscopic level of resolution (∼12 µm). This method can successfully model the sugar concentration in individual vascular bundles and within a complex organ such as the stem, leaf, or seed. The sensitivity of the assay ranges from 20 to 1,000 m<sc>m</sc>. We applied this method to the cereal crop barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) and the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to highlight the potential of the procedure for resolving the spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of metabolites. We also discuss the relevance of the method for studies on carbon allocation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e in the context of crop improvement.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of nitrogen to source leaves and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong>s is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall plant nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis plants with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and plant nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout plants. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> plants allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type plants. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sink</span></strong>s. The <i>aap2</i> plants outperformed wild-type plants with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in plants exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

Biotin Attachment Domain-Containing Proteins Irreversibly Inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
<p>The first committed step in fatty acid synthesis is mediated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase), a biotin-dependent enzyme that carboxylates acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. ACCase can be feedback regulated by short-term or long-term exposure to fatty acids in the form of Tween 80 (predominantly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing oleic acid), which results in reversible or irreversible ACCase inhibition, respectively. Biotin attachment domain-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing (BADC) proteins are inactive analogs of biotin carboxyl transfer proteins that lack biotin, and their incorporation into ACCase down-regulates its activity by displacing active (biotin-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing) biotin carboxyltransferase protein subunits. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lines <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing T-DNA insertions in <i>BADC1</i>, <i>BADC2</i>, and <i>BADC3</i> were used to generate <i>badc1 badc2</i> and <i>badc1 badc3</i> double mutants. The <i>badc1 badc3</i> mutant exhibited normal growth and development; however, ACCase activity was 26% higher in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and its seeds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed 30.1% more fatty acids and 32.6% more triacylgycerol relative to wild-type plants. To assess whether BADC contributes to the irreversible phase of ACCase inhibition, cell suspension cultures were generated from the leaves of <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type plants and treated with 10 m<sc>m</sc> Tween 80. Reversible ACCase inhibition was similar in <i>badc1 badc3</i> and wild-type cultures after 2 d of Tween 80 treatment, but irreversible inhibition was reduced by 50% in <i>badc1 badc3</i> relative to wild-type plants following 4 d of Tween 80 treatment. In this study, we present evidence for two important homeostatic roles for BADC proteins in down-regulating ACCase activity: by acting during normal growth and development and by contributing to its long-term irreversible feedback inhibition resulting from the oversupply of fatty acids.</p>

A Dioxygenase Catalyzes Steroid 16α-Hydroxylation in Steroidal Glycoalkaloid Biosynthesis
<p>Steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) are toxic specialized metabolites that are found in the Solanaceae. Potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s the SGAs α-solanine and α-chaconine, while tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s α-tomatine, all of which are biosynthesized from cholesterol. However, although two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases that catalyze the 22- and 26-hydroxylation of cholesterol have been identified, the 16-hydroxylase remains unknown. Feeding with deuterium-labeled cholesterol indicated that the 16α- and 16β-hydrogen atoms of cholesterol were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ated to form α-solanine and α-chaconine in potato, while only the 16α-hydrogen atom was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ated in α-tomatine biosynthesis, suggesting that a single oxidation at C-16 takes place during tomato SGA biosynthesis while a two-step oxidation occurs in potato. Here, we show that a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, designated as 16DOX, is involved in SGA biosynthesis. We found that the transcript of potato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>St16DOX</i>) was expressed at high levels in the tuber sprouts, where large amounts of SGAs are accumulated. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant St16DOX protein revealed that St16DOX catalyzes the 16α-hydroxylation of hydroxycholesterols and that (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol was the best substrate among the nine compounds tested. <i>St16DOX</i>-silenced potato plants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ed significantly lower levels of SGAs, and a detailed metabolite analysis revealed that they accumulated the glycosides of (22<i>S</i>)-22,26-dihydroxycholesterol. Analysis of the tomato <i>16DOX</i> (<i>Sl16DOX</i>) gene gave essentially the same results. These findings clearly indicate that 16DOX is a steroid 16α-hydroxylase that functions in the SGA biosynthetic pathway. Furthermore, <i>St16DOX</i> silencing did not affect potato tuber yield, indicating that <i>16DOX</i> may be a suitable target for controlling toxic SGA levels in potato.</p>

Role of Type 2 NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase NdbC in Redox Regulation of Carbon Allocation in <i>Synechocystis</i>
<p>NAD(P)H dehydrogenases comprise type 1 (NDH-1) and type 2 (NDH-2s) enzymes. Even though the NDH-1 complex is a well-characterized protein complex in the thylakoid membrane of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter <i>Synechocystis</i>), the exact roles of different NDH-2s remain poorly understood. To elucidate this question, we studied the function of NdbC, one of the three NDH-2s in <i>Synechocystis</i>, by constructing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion mutant (Δ<i>ndbC</i>) for a corresponding protein and submitting the mutant to physiological and biochemical characterization as well as to comprehensive proteomics analysis. We demonstrate that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion of NdbC, localized to the plasma membrane, affects several metabolic pathways in <i>Synechocystis</i> in autotrophic growth conditions without prominent effects on photosynthesis. Foremost, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion of NdbC leads, directly or indirectly, to compromised sugar catabolism, to glycogen accumulation, and to distorted cell division. Deficiencies in several sugar catabolic routes were supported by severe retardation of growth of the Δ<i>ndbC</i> mutant under light-activated heterotrophic growth conditions but not under mixotrophy. Thus, NdbC has a significant function in regulating carbon allocation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">storag</span></strong>e and the biosynthesis pathways. In addition, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion of NdbC increases the amount of cyclic electron transfer, possibly via the NDH-1<sub>2</sub> complex, and decreases the expression of several transporters in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> growth conditions.</p>

cis-Cinnamic Acid Is a Novel, Natural Auxin Efflux Inhibitor That Promotes Lateral Root Formation
<p>Auxin steers numerous physiological processes in plants, making the tight control of its endogenous levels and spatiotemporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms, including auxin biosynthesis, metabolic conversions, degradation, and transport. Here, we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (<i>c</i>-CA) as a novel and unique addition to a small group of endogenous molecules affecting in planta auxin concentrations. <i>c-CA</i> is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (<i>t</i>-CA). When grown on <i>c</i>-CA-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of plant species were shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high auxin levels, including inhibition of primary root growth, induction of root hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral rooting. By molecular docking and receptor binding assays, we showed that <i>c</i>-CA itself is neither an auxin nor an anti-auxin, and auxin profiling data revealed that <i>c</i>-CA does not significantly interfere with auxin biosynthesis. Single cell-based auxin accumulation assays showed that <i>c</i>-CA, and not <i>t</i>-CA, is a potent inhibitor of auxin efflux. Auxin signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of the auxin response along the root of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants, and long-distance auxin transport assays showed no inhibition of rootward auxin transport. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of <i>c</i>-CA-treated plants are the consequence of a local change in auxin accumulation, induced by the inhibition of auxin efflux. This work reveals a novel mechanism how plants may regulate auxin levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of auxin homeostasis.</p>

The NDH-1L-PSI Supercomplex Is Important for Efficient Cyclic Electron Transport in Cyanobacteria
<p>Two mutants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ated from a tagging library of <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. strain PCC 6803 were sensitive to high light and had a tag in <i>sll1471</i> encoding CpcG2, a linker protein for photosystem I (PSI)-specific antenna. Both mutants demonstrated strongly impaired NDH-1-dependent cyclic electron transport. Blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analyses of the wild type and a mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing CpcG2 fused with yellow fluorescent protein-histidine6 indicated the presence of a novel NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex, which was absent in the <i>cpcG2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion mutant, the PSI-less mutant, and several other strains deficient in NDH-1L and/or NDH-1M. Coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down analyses on CpcG2-yellow fluorescent protein-histidine6, using antibody against green fluorescent protein and nickel column chromatography, confirmed the association of CpcG2 with the supercomplex. Conversely, the use of antibodies against NdhH or NdhK after blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and in coimmunoprecipitation experiments verified the necessity of CpcG2 in stabilizing the supercomplex. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion of CpcG2 destabilized NDH-1L as well as its degradation product NDH-1M and significantly decreased the number of functional PSI centers, consistent with the involvement of CpcG2 in NDH-1-dependent cyclic electron transport. The CpcG2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion, however, had no effect on respiration. Thus, we propose that the formation of an NDH-1L-CpcG2-PSI supercomplex in cyanobacteria facilitates PSI cyclic electron transport via NDH-1L.</p>

CTDGFinder: A Novel Homology-Based Algorithm for Identifying Closely Spaced Clusters of Tandemly Duplicated Genes
<p>Closely spaced clusters of tandemly duplicated genes (CTDGs) contribute to the diversity of many phenotypes, including chemosensation, snake venom, and animal body plans. CTDGs have traditionally been identified subjectively as genomic neighborhoods <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing several gene duplicates in close proximity; however, CTDGs are often highly variable with respect to gene number, intergenic distance, and synteny. This lack of formal definition hampers the study of CTDG evolutionary dynamics and the discovery of novel CTDGs in the exponentially growing body of genomic data. To address this gap, we developed a novel homology-based algorithm, CTDGFinder, which formalizes and automates the identification of CTDGs by examining the physical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion of individual members of families of duplicated genes across chromosomes. Application of CTDGFinder accurately identified CTDGs for many well-known gene clusters (e.g., Hox and beta-globin gene clusters) in the human, mouse and 20 other mammalian genomes. Differences between previously annotated gene clusters and our inferred CTDGs were due to the exclusion of nonhomologs that have historically been considered parts of specific gene clusters, the inclusion or absence of genes between the CTDGs and their corresponding gene clusters, and the splitting of certain gene clusters into distinct CTDGs. Examination of human genes showing tissue-specific enhancement of their expression by CTDGFinder identified members of several well-known gene clusters (e.g., cytochrome P450s and olfactory receptors) and revealed that they were unequally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ed across tissues. By formalizing and automating CTDG identification, CTDGFinder will facilitate understanding of CTDG evolutionary dynamics, their functional implications, and how they are associated with phenotypic diversity.</p>

The repeats have been further hyperlinked to the annotated gene regions (coding or non-coding) and a link to the corresponding gene record in National Center for Biotechnology Information(<ext-link>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) to identify and understand the positional relationship of the repetitive tracts. ChloroMitoSSRDB is connected to a user-friendly web interface that provides useful information associated with the location of the repeats (coding and non-coding), size of repeat, motif and length polymorphism, etc. ChloroMitoSSRDB will serve as a repository for developing functional markers for molecular phylogenetics, estimating molecular variation across species.

An atrial-fibrillation-linked connexin40 mutant is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and impairs the function of atrial gap-junction channels
<p>Connexin40 (Cx40)-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing gap-junction channels are expressed in the atrial myocardium and provide a low-resistance passage for rapid impulse propagation. A germline mutation in the <i>GJA5</i> gene, which encodes Cx40, resulting in a truncated Cx40 (Q49X) was identified in a large Chinese family with lone (idiopathic) atrial fibrillation (AF). This mutation co-segregated with seven AF probands in an autosomal-dominant way over generations. To test the hypothesis that this Cx40 mutant affects the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion and function of atrial gap junctions, we studied the Q49X mutant in gap-junction-deficient HeLa and N2A cells. The Q49X mutant, unlike wild-type Cx40, was typically localized in the cytoplasm and failed to form gap-junction plaques at cell-cell interfaces. When the Q49X mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43, the mutant substantially reduced the gap-junction plaque formation of Cx40 and Cx43. Electrophysiological studies revealed no electrical coupling of cell pairs expressing the mutant alone and a significant decrease in the coupling conductance when the mutant was co-expressed with Cx40 or Cx43. Further colocalization experiments with the organelle residential proteins indicate that Q49X was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings provide evidence that the Q49X mutant is capable of impairing gap-junction <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">distribut</span></strong></span></strong>ion and function of key atrial connexins, which might play a role in the predisposition to and onset of AF.</p>

A murine <i>Zic3</i> transcript with a premature termination codon evades nonsense-mediated decay during axis formation
<p>The ZIC transcription factors are key mediators of embryonic development and <i>ZIC3</i> is the gene most commonly associated with <i>situs</i> defects (heterotaxy) in humans. Half of patient <i>ZIC3</i> mutations introduce a premature termination codon (PTC). <i>In vivo</i>, PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcripts might be targeted for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). NMD efficiency is known to vary greatly between transcripts, tissues and individuals and it is possible that differences in survival of PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcripts partially explain the striking phenotypic variability that characterizes ZIC3-associated congenital defects. For example, the PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcripts might encode a C-terminally truncated protein that retains partial function or that dominantly interferes with other ZIC family members. Here we describe the katun (<i>Ka</i>) mouse mutant, which harbours a mutation in the <i>Zic3</i> gene that results in a PTC. At the time of axis formation there is no discernible decrease in this PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing transcript <i>in vivo</i>, indicating that the mammalian <i>Zic3</i> transcript is relatively insensitive to NMD, prompting the need to re-examine the molecular function of the truncated proteins predicted from human studies and to determine whether the N-terminal portion of ZIC3 possesses dominant-negative capabilities. A combination of <i>in vitro</i> studies and analysis of the <i>Ka</i> phenotype indicate that it is a null allele of <i>Zic3</i> and that the N-terminal portion of ZIC3 does not encode a dominant-negative molecule. Heterotaxy in patients with PTC-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>ing <i>ZIC3</i> transcripts probably arises due to loss of ZIC3 function alone.</p>

An inducible knockout mouse to model the cell-autonomous role of PTEN in initiating endometrial, prostate and thyroid neoplasias
<p><i>PTEN</i> is one of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancers. The role of PTEN in carcinogenesis has been validated by knockout mouse models. <i>PTEN</i> heterozygous mice develop neoplasms in multiple organs. Unfortunately, the embryonic lethality of biallelic excision of <i>PTEN</i> has inhibited the study of complete <i>PTEN</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion in the development and progression of cancer. By crossing PTEN conditional knockout mice with transgenic mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER<sup>T</sup> under the control of a chicken actin promoter, we have generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model that allows temporal control of <i>PTEN</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion. Interestingly, administration of a single dose of tamoxifen resulted in <i>PTEN</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion mainly in epithelial cells, but not in stromal, mesenchymal or hematopoietic cells. Using the mT/mG double-fluorescent Cre reporter mice, we demonstrate that epithelial-specific <i>PTEN</i> excision was caused by differential Cre activity among tissues and cells types. Tamoxifen-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion of <i>PTEN</i> resulted in extremely rapid and consistent formation of endometrial <i>in situ</i> adenocarcinoma, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and thyroid hyperplasia. We also analyzed the role of PTEN ablation in other epithelial cells, such as the tubular cells of the kidney, hepatocytes, colonic epithelial cells or bronchiolar epithelium, but those tissues did not exhibit neoplastic growth. Finally, to validate this model as a tool to assay the efficacy of anti-tumor drugs in PTEN deficiency, we administered the mTOR inhibitor everolimus to mice with induced <i>PTEN</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion. Everolimus dramatically reduced the progression of endometrial proliferations and significantly reduced thyroid hyperplasia. This model could be a valuable tool to study the cell-autonomous mechanisms involved in PTEN-loss-induced carcinogenesis and provides a good platform to study the effect of anti-neoplastic drugs on PTEN-negative tumors.</p>

Bmal1 in Perivascular Adipose Tissue Regulates Resting-Phase Blood Pressure Through Transcriptional Regulation of Angiotensinogen
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) surrounding vessels constitutes a distinct functional integral layer of the vasculature required to preserve vascular tone under physiological conditions. However, there is little information on the relationship between PVAT and blood pressure regulation, including its potential contributions to circadian blood pressure variation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Using unique brown adipocyte–specific aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Bmal1) and angiotensinogen knockout mice, we determined the vasoactivity of homogenized PVAT in aortic rings and how brown adipocyte peripheral expression of Bmal1 and angiotensinogen in PVAT regulates the amplitude of diurnal change in blood pressure in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We uncovered a peripheral clock in PVAT and demonstrated that loss of Bmal1 in PVAT reduces blood pressure in mice during the resting phase, leading to a superdipper phenotype. PVAT extracts from wild-type mice significantly induced contractility of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ated aortic rings in vitro in an endothelium-independent manner. This property was impaired in PVAT from brown adipocyte–selective Bmal1-deficient (BA-Bmal1-KO) mice. The PVAT contractile properties were mediated by local angiotensin II, operating through angiotensin II type 1 receptor–dependent signaling in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isol</span></strong>ated vessels and linked to PVAT circadian regulation of angiotensinogen. Indeed, angiotensinogen mRNA and angiotensin II levels in PVAT of BA-Bmal1-KO mice were significantly reduced. Systemic infusion of angiotensin II, in turn, reduced Bmal1 expression in PVAT while <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">elimin</span></strong>ating the hypotensive phenotype during the resting phase in BA-Bmal1-KO mice. Angiotensinogen, highly expressed in PVAT, shows circadian expression in PVAT, and selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion of angiotensinogen in brown adipocytes recapitulates the phenotype of selective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">delet</span></strong>ion of Bmal1 in brown adipocytes.

<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The pericardial adipose tissue (AT) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contain</span></strong>s a high density of lymphoid clusters. It is unknown whether these clusters play a role in post–myocardial infarction (MI) inflammatory responses and cardiac outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Lymphoid clusters were examined in epicardial AT of humans with or without coronary artery disease. Murine pericardial lymphoid clusters were visualized in mice subjected to coronary artery ligation. To study the relevance of pericardial clusters during inflammatory responses after MI, we surgically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">remov</span></strong>ed the pericardial AT and performed B-cell depletion and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor blockade. Leukocytes in murine hearts, pericardial AT, spleen, mediastinal lymph nodes, and bone marrow were quantified by flow cytometry. Cannabinoid receptor CB2 (CB2<sup>–/–</sup>) mice were used as a model for enhanced B-cell responses. The effect of impaired dendritic cell (DC) trafficking on pericardial AT inflammatory responses was tested in CCR7<sup>–/–</sup> mice subjected to MI. Cardiac fibrosis and ventricular function were assessed by histology and echocardiography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified larger B-cell clusters in epicardial AT of human patients with coronary artery disease in comparison with controls without coronary artery disease. Infarcted mice also had larger pericardial clusters and 3-fold upregulated numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor–producing B cells within pericardial AT, but not spleen or lymph nodes. This was associated with higher DC and T-cell counts in pericardial AT, which outnumbered DCs and T cells in lymph nodes. Analysis of DC maturation markers, tracking experiments with fluorescently labeled cells, and use of CCR7-deficient mice suggested that activated DCs migrate from infarcts into pericardial AT via CCR7. B-cell depletion or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor neutralization inhibited DC and T-cell expansion within pericardial AT, and translated into reduced bone marrow granulopoiesis and cardiac neutrophil infiltration 3 days after MI. The relevance of the pericardial AT in mediating all these effects was confirmed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">remov</span></strong>al of pericardial AT and ex vivo coculture with pericardial AT and granulocyte progenitors. Finally, enhanced fibrosis and worsened <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction in CB2<sup>–/–</sup> mice were limited by pericardial AT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">remov</span></strong>al.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings unveil a new mechanism by which the pericardial AT coordinates immune cell activation, granulopoiesis, and outcome after MI.</p></sec>

ICare-ACS (Improving Care Processes for Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome)
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Efforts to safely reduce length of stay for emergency department patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have had mixed success. Few system-wide efforts affecting multiple hospital emergency departments have ever been evaluated. We evaluated the effectiveness of a nationwide implementation of clinical pathways for potential ACS in disparate hospitals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This was a multicenter pragmatic stepped-wedge before-and-after trial in 7 New Zealand acute care hospitals with 31 332 patients investigated for suspected ACS with serial troponin measurements. The implementation was a clinical pathway for the assessment of patients with suspected ACS that included a clinical pathway document in paper or electronic format, structured risk stratification, specified time points for electrocardiographic and serial troponin testing within 3 hours of arrival, and directions for combining risk stratification and electrocardiographic and troponin testing in an accelerated diagnostic protocol. Implementation was monitored for >4 months and compared with usual care over the preceding 6 months. The main outcome measure was the odds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e within 6 hours of presentation</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were 11 529 participants in the preimplementation phase (range, 284–3465) and 19 803 in the postimplementation phase (range, 395–5039). Overall, the mean 6-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e rate increased from 8.3% (range, 2.7%–37.7%) to 18.4% (6.8%–43.8%). The odds of being <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed within 6 hours increased after clinical pathway implementation. The odds ratio was 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.3–2.6). In patients without ACS, the median length of hospital stays decreased by 2.9 hours (95% confidence interval, 2.4–3.4). For patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed within 6 hours, there was no change in 30-day major adverse cardiac event rates (0.52% versus 0.44%; <i>P</i>=0.96). In these patients, no adverse event occurred when clinical pathways were correctly followed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Implementation of clinical pathways for suspected ACS reduced the length of stay and increased the proportions of patients safely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed within 6 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.anzctr.org.au/</ext-link> (Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry).

Hospital Variation in Adherence Rates to Secondary Prevention Medications and the Implications on Quality
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Medication adherence is important to improve the long-term outcomes after acute myocardial infarction (MI). We hypothesized that there is significant variation among US hospitals in terms of medication adherence after MI, and that patients treated at hospitals with higher medication adherence after MI will have better long-term cardiovascular outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We identified 19 704 Medicare patients <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed after acute MI from 347 US hospitals participating in the ACTION Registry-GWTG (Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines) from January 2, 2007, to October 1, 2010. Using linked Medicare Part D prescription filling data, medication adherence was defined as proportion of days covered >80% within 90 days after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compare 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events among hospitals with high, moderate, and low 90-day medication adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By 90 days after MI, overall rates of adherence to medications prescribed at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e were 68% for β-blockers, 63% for statins, 64% for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and 72% for thienopyridines. Adherence to these medications up to 90 days varied significantly among hospitals: β-blockers (proportion of days covered >80%; 59% to 75%), statins (55% to 69%), thienopyridines (64% to 77%), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (57% to 69%). Compared with hospitals in the lowest quartile of 90-day composite medication adherence, hospitals with the highest adherence had lower unadjusted and adjusted 2-year major adverse cardiovascular event risk (27.5% versus 35.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.80–0.96). High-adherence hospitals also had lower adjusted rates of death or readmission (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.85–0.96), whereas there was no difference in mortality after adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Use of secondary prevention medications after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e varies significantly among US hospitals and is inversely associated with 2-year outcomes. Hospitals may improve medication adherence after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e and patient outcomes through better coordination of care between inpatient and outpatient settings.</p></sec>

Heart Failure Stages Among Older Adults in the Community
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Although heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects older adults, little data exist regarding the prevalence of American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF stages among older individuals in the community. Additionally, the role of contemporary measures of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction in defining HF stages is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>HF stages were classified in 6118 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (67–91 years of age) at the fifth study visit as follows: A (asymptomatic with HF risk factors but no cardiac structural or functional abnormalities), B (asymptomatic with structural abnormalities, defined as left ventricular hypertrophy, dilation or dysfunction, or significant valvular disease), C1 (clinical HF without prior hospitalization), and C2 (clinical HF with earlier hospitalization).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Using the traditional definitions of HF stages, only 5% of examined participants were free of HF risk factors or structural heart disease (Stage 0), 52% were categorized as Stage A, 30% Stage B, 7% Stage C1, and 6% Stage C2. Worse HF stage was associated with a greater risk of incident HF hospitalization or death at a median follow-up of 608 days. Left ventricular (LV) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction was preserved in 77% and 65% in Stages C1 and C2, respectively. Incorporation of longitudinal strain and diastolic dysfunction into the Stage B definition reclassified 14% of the sample from Stage A to B and improved the net reclassification index (<i>P</i>=0.028) and integrated discrimination index (<i>P</i>=0.016). Abnormal LV structure, systolic function (based on LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction and longitudinal strain), and diastolic function (based on e’, E/e’, and left atrial volume index) were each independently and additively associated with risk of incident HF hospitalization or death in Stage A and B participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The majority of older adults in the community are at risk for HF (Stages A or B), appreciably more compared with previous reports in younger community-based samples. LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction is robustly preserved in at least two-thirds of older adults with prevalent HF (Stage C), highlighting the burden of HF with preserved LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction in the elderly. LV diastolic function and longitudinal strain provide incremental prognostic value beyond conventional measures of LV structure and LV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">eject</span></strong>ion fraction in identifying persons at risk for HF hospitalization or death.</p></sec>

Treatment With Tissue Plasminogen Activator in the Golden Hour and the Shape of the 4.5-Hour Time-Benefit Curve in the National United States Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Earlier tissue plasminogen activator treatment improves ischemic stroke outcome, but aspects of the time-benefit relationship still not well delineated are: (1) the degree of additional benefit accrued with treatment in the first 60 minutes after onset, and (2) the shape of the time-benefit curve through 4.5 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed patients who had acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4.5 hours of onset from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke US national program. Onset-to-treatment time was analyzed as a continuous, potentially nonlinear variable and as a categorical variable comparing patients treated within 60 minutes of onset with later epochs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 65 384 tissue plasminogen activator–treated patients, the median onset-to-treatment time was 141 minutes (interquartile range, 110–173) and 878 patients (1.3%) were treated within the first 60 minutes. Treatment within 60 minutes, compared with treatment within 61 to 270 minutes, was associated with increased odds of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e to home (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.45), independent ambulation at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e (adjusted odds ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.45), and freedom from disability (modified Rankin Scale 0–1) at <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e (adjusted odds ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.21–2.46), without increased hemorrhagic complications or in-hospital mortality. The pace of decline in benefit of tissue plasminogen activator from onset-to-treatment times of 20 through 270 minutes was mildly nonlinear for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>e to home, with more rapid benefit loss in the first 170 minutes than later, and linear for independent ambulation and in-hospital mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Thrombolysis started within the first 60 minutes after onset is associated with best outcomes for patients with acute ischemic stroke, and benefit declined more rapidly early after onset for the ability to be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">discharg</span></strong>ed home. These findings support intensive efforts to organize stroke systems of care to improve the timeliness of thrombolytic therapy in acute ischemic stroke.</p></sec>

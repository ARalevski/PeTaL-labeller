Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Facilitates Synthesis of Photoactive Protochlorophyllide in Etioplasts
<p>Cotyledon cells of dark-germinated angiosperms develop etioplasts that are plastids containing unique internal membranes called prolamellar bodies (PLBs). Protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), a precursor of chlorophyll, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ates in PLBs and forms a ternary complex with NADPH and light-dependent NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR), which allows for the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of chlorophyll after illumination while avoiding photodamage. PLBs are 3D lattice structures formed by the lipid bilayer rich in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Although MGDG was found to be required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and function of the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts in various plants, the roles of MGDG in PLB <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and etioplast development are largely unknown. To analyze the roles of MGDG in etioplast development, we suppressed <i>MGD1</i> encoding the major isoform of MGDG synthase by using a dexamethasone-inducible artificial microRNA in etiolated Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. Strong <i>MGD1</i> suppression caused a 36% loss of MGDG in etiolated seedlings, together with a 41% decrease in total Pchlide content. The loss of MGDG perturbed etioplast membrane structures and impaired the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of the photoactive Pchlide-LPOR-NADPH complex and its oligomerization, without affecting LPOR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. The <i>MGD1</i> suppression also impaired the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of Pchlide from protoporphyrin IX via multiple enzymatic reactions in etioplast membranes, which suggests that MGDG is required for the membrane-associated processes in the Pchlide biosynthesis pathway. Suppressing <i>MGD1</i> at several germination stages revealed that MGDG biosynthesis at an early germination stage is particularly important for Pchlide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. MGDG biosynthesis may provide a lipid matrix for Pchlide biosynthesis and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of Pchlide-LPOR complexes as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al step of etioplast development.</p>

Effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature response on changes in the sorbitol concentration in xylem sap of Japanese pear during winter season
<p>In order to elucidate which physiological event(s) are involved in the seasonal changes of carbohydrate dynamics during winter, we examined the effects of different low temperatures on the carbohydrate concentrations of Japanese pear (<i>Pyrus pyrifolia</i> (Burm.) Nakai). For four winter seasons, large increases in the sorbitol concentration of shoot xylem sap occurred during mid- to late December, possibly due to the endodormancy completion and low-temperature responses. When trees were kept at 15 °C from 3 November to 3 December in order to postpone the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation and completion of chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation that would break endodormancy, sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in xylem sap was always higher from trees with sufficient chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation than from trees that received insufficient chilling. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred around late December in trees regardless of whether their chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation naturally progressed or was postponed. To examine different temperature effects more closely, we compared the carbohydrate concentrations of trees subjected to either 6 or 0 °C treatment. The sorbitol concentration in xylem sap tremendously increased at 0 °C treatment compared with 6 °C treatment. However, an additional increase in xylem sap sorbitol occurred at both the temperatures when sufficient chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated with a peak coinciding with the peak expression in shoots of the sorbitol transporter gene (<i>PpSOT2</i>). Interestingly, the total carbohydrate concentration of shoots tremendously increased with exposure to 0 °C compared with exposure to 6 °C, but was not affected by the amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated chilling. Instead, as chilling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated the ratio of sorbitol to total soluble sugars in shoots increased. We presumed that carbohydrates in the shoot tissues may be converted to sorbitol and loaded into the xylem sap so that the sorbitol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation patterns were synchronized with the progression of dormancy, whereas the total carbohydrate transported into shoots from other storage organs may be related to freezing tolerance acquisition independent of dormancy progression. We thus propose that there are different effects of dormancy progression and low-temperature responses on carbohydrate dynamics in Japanese pear.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
Synergistic Pectin Degradation and Guard Cell Pressurization Underlie Stomatal Pore Formation
<p>Stomatal pores are vital for the diffusion of gasses into and out of land plants and are, therefore, gatekeepers for photosynthesis and transpiration. Although much published literature has described the intercellular signaling and transcriptional regulators involved in early stomatal development, little is known about the cellular details of the local separation between sister guard cells that give rise to the stomatal pore or how <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of this pore is achieved. Using three-dimensional (3D) time-lapse imaging, we found that stomatal pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) is a highly dynamic process involving pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation and enlargement and traverses a set of morphological milestones in 3D. Confocal imaging data revealed an enrichment of exocytic machinery, de-methyl-esterified pectic homogalacturonan (HG), and an HG-degrading enzyme at future pore sites, suggesting that both localized HG deposition and degradation might function in pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. By manipulating HG modification via enzymatic, chemical, and genetic perturbations in seedling cotyledons, we found that augmenting HG modification promotes pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, whereas preventing HG de-methyl-esterification delays pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation and inhibits pore enlargement. Through mechanical modeling and experimentation, we tested whether pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion is an outcome of sister guard cells being pulled away from each other upon turgor increase. Osmotic treatment to reduce turgor pressure did not prevent pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation but did lessen pore enlargement. Together, these data provide evidence that HG delivery and modification, and guard cell pressurization, make functional contributions to stomatal pore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation and enlargement.</p>

Regulation of Hormonal Control, Cell Reprogramming, and Patterning during De Novo Root Organogenesis
<p>Body regeneration through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of new organs is a major question in developmental biology. We investigated de novo root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion using whole leaves of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our results show that local cytokinin biosynthesis and auxin biosynthesis in the leaf blade followed by auxin long-distance transport to the petiole leads to proliferation of J0121-marked xylem-associated tissues and others through signaling of INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE28 (IAA28), CRANE (IAA18), WOODEN LEG, and ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS1 (ARR1), ARR10, and ARR12. Vasculature proliferation also involves the cell cycle regulator KIP-RELATED PROTEIN2 and ABERRANT LATERAL ROOT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ION4, resulting in a mass of cells with rooting competence that resembles callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Endogenous callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion precedes specification of postembryonic root founder cells, from which roots are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated through the activity of SHORT-ROOT, PLETHORA1 (PLT1), and PLT2. Primordia <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation is blocked in <i>shr plt1 plt2</i> mutant. Stem cell regulators SCHIZORIZA, JACKDAW, BLUEJAY, and SCARECROW also participate in root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation and are required to pattern the new organ, as mutants show disorganized and reduced number of layers and tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>als resulting in reduced rooting.

Development
Development of the prethalamus is crucial for thalamocortical projection formation and is regulated by Olig2
<p>Thalamocortical axons (TCAs) pass through the prethalamus in the first step of their neural circuit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Although it has been supposed that the prethalamus is an intermediate target for thalamocortical projection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, much less is known about the molecular mechanisms of this targeting. Here, we demonstrated the functional implications of the prethalamus in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of this neural circuit. We show that Olig2 transcription factor, which is expressed in the ventricular zone (VZ) of prosomere 3, regulates prethalamus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, and loss of Olig2 results in reduced prethalamus size in early development, which is accompanied by expansion of the thalamic eminence (TE). Extension of TCAs is disorganized in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> dorsal thalamus, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al elongation of TCAs is retarded in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> forebrain. Microarray analysis demonstrated upregulation of several axon guidance molecules, including <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, in the <i>Olig2-KO</i> basal forebrain. <i>In situ</i> hybridization showed that the prethalamus in the wild type excluded the expression of <i>Epha3</i> and <i>Epha5</i>, whereas loss of Olig2 resulted in reduction of this Ephas-negative area and the corresponding expansion of the Ephas-positive TE. Dissociated cultures of thalamic progenitor cells demonstrated that substrate-bound EphA3 suppresses neurite extension from dorsal thalamic neurons. These results indicate that Olig2 is involved in correct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of the prethalamus, which leads to exclusion of the EphA3-expressing region and is crucial for proper TCA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion.

Protein crystallization promotes type 2 immunity and is reversible by antibody treatment
<p>Although spontaneous protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization is a rare event in vivo, Charcot-Leyden <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s (CLCs) consisting of galectin-10 (Gal10) protein are frequently observed in eosinophilic diseases, such as asthma. We found that CLCs derived from patients showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> packing and Gal10 structure identical to those of Gal10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s grown in vitro. When administered to the airways, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>line Gal10 stimulated innate and adaptive immunity and acted as a type 2 adjuvant. By contrast, a soluble Gal10 mutein was inert. Antibodies directed against key epitopes of the CLC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization interface dissolved preexisting CLCs in patient-derived mucus within hours and reversed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>-driven inflammation, goblet-cell metaplasia, immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis, and bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) in a humanized mouse model of asthma.

The R2R3-MYB Transcription Factor MYB49 Regulates Cadmium Accumulation
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of potentially toxic cadmium (Cd) in plants. How the ABA signal is transmitted to modulate Cd uptake remains largely unclear. Here, we report that the basic region/Leu zipper transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5), a central ABA signaling molecule, is involved in ABA-repressed Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in plants by physically interacting with a previously uncharacterized R2R3-type MYB transcription factor, MYB49. Overexpression of the Cd-induced <i>MYB49</i> gene in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) resulted in a significant increase in Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation, whereas <i>myb49</i> knockout plants and plants expressing chimeric repressors of <i>MYB49</i>:ERF-associated amphiphilic repression motif repression domain (<i>SRDX49</i>) exhibited reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of Cd. Further investigations revealed that MYB49 positively regulates the expression of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors <i>bHLH38</i> and <i>bHLH101</i> by directly binding to their promoters, leading to activation of <i>IRON-REGULATED TRANSPORTER1</i>, which encodes a metal transporter involved in Cd uptake. MYB49 also binds to the promoter regions of the heavy metal-associated isoprenylated plant proteins (<i>HIPP22</i>) and <i>HIPP44</i>, resulting in up-regulation of their expression and subsequent Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. On the other hand, as a feedback mechanism to control Cd uptake and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in plant cells, Cd-induced ABA up-regulates the expression of <i>ABI5</i>, whose protein product interacts with MYB49 and prevents its binding to the promoters of downstream genes, thereby reducing Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. Our results provide new insights into the molecular feedback mechanisms underlying ABA signaling-controlled Cd uptake and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in plants.</p>

Colossal grain growth yields single-crystal metal foils by contact-free annealing
<p>Single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> metals have distinctive properties owing to the absence of grain boundaries and strong anisotropy.

The colossal grain growth (up to 32 square centimeters) is achieved by minimizing contact stresses, resulting in a preferred in-plane and out-of-plane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> orientation, and is driven by surface energy minimization during the rotation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> lattice followed by “consumption” of neighboring grains.

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in plant development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone signaling in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing plants, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-silenced plants. Moreover, exogenous application of BR enhanced chlorophyll content and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and decreased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of ubiquitinated proteins under nitrogen starvation. Leaf chlorosis and chlorophyll degradation were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced plants and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants under nitrogen starvation. Meanwhile, nitrogen starvation-induced expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion were compromised in both <i>BZR1</i>-silenced and <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> plants but were increased in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing plants.

Wounding Triggers Callus Formation via Dynamic Hormonal and Transcriptional Changes
<p>Wounding is a primary trigger of organ regeneration, but how wound stress reactivates cell proliferation and promotes cellular reprogramming remains elusive. In this study, we combined transcriptome analysis with quantitative hormonal analysis to investigate how wounding induces callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Our time course RNA-seq analysis revealed that wounding induces dynamic transcriptional changes, starting from rapid stress responses followed by the activation of metabolic processes and protein synthesis and subsequent activation of cell cycle regulators. Gene ontology analyses further uncovered that wounding modifies the expression of hormone biosynthesis and response genes, and quantitative analysis of endogenous plant hormones revealed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of cytokinin prior to callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Mutants defective in cytokinin synthesis and signaling display reduced efficiency in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, indicating that de novo synthesis of cytokinin is critical for wound-induced callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. We further demonstrate that type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR-mediated cytokinin signaling regulates the expression of <i>CYCLIN D3;1</i> (<i>CYCD3;1</i>) and that mutations in <i>CYCD3;1</i> and its homologs <i>CYCD3;2</i> and <i>3</i> cause defects in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. In addition to these hormone-mediated changes, our transcriptome data uncovered that wounding activates multiple developmental regulators, and we found novel roles of ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 115 and PLETHORA3 (PLT3), PLT5, and PLT7 in callus generation. All together, these results provide novel mechanistic insights into how wounding reactivates cell proliferation during callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion.</p>

Biochemical Principles and Functional Aspects of Pipecolic Acid Biosynthesis in Plant Immunity
<p>The nonprotein amino acid pipecolic acid (Pip) regulates plant systemic acquired resistance and basal immunity to bacterial pathogen infection. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the lysine (Lys) aminotransferase AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1 (ALD1) mediates the pathogen-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of Pip in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inocul</span></strong>ated and distal leaf tissue. Here, we show that ALD1 transfers the α-amino group of <sc>l</sc>-Lys to acceptor oxoacids. Combined mass spectrometric and infrared spectroscopic analyses of in vitro assays and plant extracts indicate that the final product of the ALD1-catalyzed reaction is enaminic 2,3-dehydropipecolic acid (DP), whose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion involves consecutive transamination, cyclization, and isomerization steps. Besides <sc>l</sc>-Lys, recombinant ALD1 transaminates <sc>l</sc>-methionine, <sc>l</sc>-leucine, diaminopimelate, and several other amino acids to generate oxoacids or derived products in vitro. However, detailed in planta analyses suggest that the biosynthesis of 2,3-DP from <sc>l</sc>-Lys is the major in vivo function of ALD1. Since <i>ald1</i> mutant plants are able to convert exogenous 2,3-DP into Pip, their Pip deficiency relies on the inability to form the 2,3-DP intermediate. The Arabidopsis reductase ornithine cyclodeaminase/μ-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lin, alias SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE-DEFICIENT4 (SARD4), converts ALD1-generated 2,3-DP into Pip in vitro. SARD4 significantly contributes to the production of Pip in pathogen-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inocul</span></strong>ated leaves but is not the exclusive reducing enzyme involved in Pip biosynthesis. Functional <i>SARD4</i> is required for proper basal immunity to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Although <i>SARD4</i> knockout plants show greatly reduced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of Pip in leaves distal to <i>P. syringae</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">inocul</span></strong>ation, they display a considerable systemic acquired resistance response. This suggests a triggering function of locally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ating Pip for systemic resistance induction.</p>

<i>Arabidopsis</i> ATXR2 deposits H3K36me3 at the promoters of <i>LBD</i> genes to facilitate cellular dedifferentiation
<p>Cellular dedifferentiation, the transition of differentiated somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells, ensures developmental plasticity and contributes to wound healing in plants. Wounding induces cells to form a mass of unorganized pluripotent cells called callus at the wound site. Explanted cells can also form callus tissues in vitro. Reversible cellular differentiation-dedifferentiation processes in higher eukaryotes are controlled mainly by chromatin modifications. We demonstrate that ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED 2 (ATXR2), a histone lysine methyltransferase that promotes the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of histone H3 proteins that are trimethylated on lysine 36 (H3K36me3) during callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, promotes early stages of cellular dedifferentiation through activation of <i>LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN</i> (<i>LBD</i>) genes. The <i>LBD</i> genes of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> are activated during cellular dedifferentiation to enhance the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of callus. Leaf explants from <i>Arabidopsis atxr2</i> mutants exhibited a reduced ability to form callus and a substantial reduction in <i>LBD</i> gene expression. ATXR2 bound to the promoters of <i>LBD</i> genes and was required for the deposition of H3K36me3 at these promoters. ATXR2 was recruited to <i>LBD</i> promoters by the transcription factors AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF7) and ARF19. Leaf explants from <i>arf7-1arf19-2</i> double mutants were defective in callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and showed reduced H3K36me3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation at <i>LBD</i> promoters. Genetic analysis provided further support that ARF7 and ARF19 were required for the ability of ATXR2 to promote the expression of <i>LBD</i> genes. These observations indicate that the ATXR2-ARF-LBD axis is key for the epigenetic regulation of callus <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.</p>

Atmospheric new particle formation from sulfuric acid and amines in a Chinese megacity
<p>Atmospheric new particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion (NPF) is an important global phenomenon that is nevertheless sensitive to ambient conditions. According to both observation and theoretical arguments, NPF usually requires a relatively high sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) concentration to promote the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of new particles and a low preexisting aerosol loading to minimize the sink of new particles. We investigated NPF in Shanghai and were able to observe both precursor vapors (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al clusters at a molecular level in a megacity. High NPF rates were observed to coincide with several familiar markers suggestive of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>–dimethylamine (DMA)–water (H<sub>2</sub>O) nucleation, including sulfuric acid dimers and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>-DMA clusters. In a cluster kinetics simulation, the observed concentration of sulfuric acid was high enough to explain the particle growth to ~3 nanometers under the very high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation sink, whereas the subsequent higher growth rate beyond this size is believed to result from the added contribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ing organic species. These findings will help in understanding urban NPF and its air quality and climate effects, as well as in formulating policies to mitigate secondary particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in China.</p>

Single-crystal x-ray diffraction structures of covalent organic frameworks
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization problem is an outstanding challenge in the chemistry of porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Their structural characterization has been limited to modeling and solutions based on powder x-ray or electron diffraction data. Single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s of COFs amenable to x-ray diffraction characterization have not been reported.

Signatures of exciton condensation in a transition metal dichalcogenide
<p>Bose <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>ation has shaped our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors, atomic gases, and liquid helium. Excitons are bosons that have been predicted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>e into either a superfluid or an insulating electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>. Using the recently developed technique of momentum‐resolved electron energy‐loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied electronic collective modes in the transition metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1<i>T</i>‐TiSe<sub>2</sub>.

ANGUSTIFOLIA Regulates Actin Filament Alignment for Nuclear Positioning in Leaves
<p>During dark adaptation, plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nuclei</span></strong> move centripetally toward the midplane of the leaf blade; thus, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nuclei</span></strong> on both the adaxial and abaxial sides become positioned at the inner periclinal walls of cells. This centripetal nuclear positioning implies that a characteristic cell polarity exists within a leaf, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this process. Here, we show that ANGUSTIFOLIA (AN) and ACTIN7 regulate centripetal nuclear positioning in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Two mutants defective in the positioning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nuclei</span></strong> in the dark were isolated and designated as <i>unusual nuclear positioning1</i> (<i>unp1</i>) and <i>unp2</i>. In the dark, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nuclei</span></strong> of <i>unp1</i> were positioned at the anticlinal walls of adaxial and abaxial mesophyll cells and abaxial pavement cells, whereas the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nuclei</span></strong> of <i>unp2</i> were positioned at the anticlinal walls of mesophyll and pavement cells on both the adaxial and abaxial sides. <i>unp1</i> was caused by a dominant-negative mutation in <i>ACTIN7</i>, and <i>unp2</i> resulted from a recessive mutation in <i>AN</i>. Actin filaments in <i>unp1</i> were fragmented and reduced in number, which led to pleiotropic defects in nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic streaming, and plant growth. The mutation in <i>AN</i> caused aberrant positioning of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">nuclei</span></strong>-associated actin filaments at the anticlinal walls. AN was detected in the cytosol, where it interacted physically with plant-specific dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKPs) and itself. The DYRK inhibitor (1<i>Z</i>)-1-(3-ethyl-5-hydroxy-2(3<i>H</i>)-benzothiazolylidene)-2-propanone significantly inhibited dark-induced nuclear positioning. Collectively, these results suggest that the AN-DYRKP complex regulates the alignment of actin filaments during centripetal nuclear positioning in leaf cells.</p>

<i>Medicago</i> Plants Control Nodulation by Regulating Proteolysis of the Receptor-Like Kinase DMI2
<p>Plants use receptor-like kinases to monitor environmental changes and transduce signals into plant cells. The <i>Medicago truncatula</i> (hereafter <i>M</i>. <i>truncatula</i>) DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS2 (DMI2) protein functions as a coreceptor of rhizobial signals to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ate nodule development and rhizobial infection during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, but the mechanisms regulating DMI2 protein level and folding are still unknown. Here, we report that DMI2 protein abundance changes during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ates in the nodules and is induced by rhizobia treatment through a posttranscriptional process. However, DMI2 induction is independent of the perception of Nod factor, a group of lipochitooligosaccharides secreted by rhizobia. The stability of the DMI2 protein is controlled by the proteasome pathway: in rhizobia-free environments, DMI2 is degraded by the proteasome, but during rhizobial infection, DMI2 is protected from the proteasome, resulting in protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitor-promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of DMI2 protein in <i>Medicago</i> roots induces the expression of two early nodulation marker genes, supporting the hypothesis that DMI2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation activates downstream symbiosis signaling. The extracellular region of DMI2 contains two malectin-like domains (MLDs) and a leucine-rich repeat. When conserved amino acids in the MLDs are mutated, DMI2 fails to restore nodule development in <i>dmi2</i> mutants, and point-mutated MLD proteins are degraded constitutively, suggesting that the MLD may be vital for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of DMI2. Our findings suggest that legumes control nodule development through modulating the protein level of DMI2, revealing a layer of regulation in the interaction between plants and rhizobia in nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.</p>

NDH-PSI Supercomplex Assembly Precedes Full Assembly of the NDH Complex in Chloroplast
<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex is structurally similar to respiratory complex I and mediates PSI cyclic electron flow. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast NDH is composed of at least 29 subunits and associates with two copies of PSI to form the NDH-PSI supercomplex. Here, we found that CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION3 (CRR3) is an assembly factor required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of subcomplex B (SubB) of chloroplast NDH. In Suc density gradient centrifugation, CRR3 was detected in three protein complexes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of the largest peak III complex was impaired in mutants defective in the SubB subunits PnsB2-PnsB5. The oligomeric form of CRR3 likely functions to assemble the core of SubB to form the peak III complex as an assembly intermediate. A defect in the PnsL3 subunit increased the level of the peak III complex, suggesting that CRR3 was released from the assembly intermediate after PnsL3 binding. Unlike PnsB2-PnsB5 and PnsL3, PnsB1 was not absolutely necessary for stabilizing SubB. PnsB1 is likely incorporated into the intermediate at the final step during SubB assembly. Lhca6 is a linker protein mediating NDH-PSI supercomplex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, and its site of contact with NDH was suggested to be SubB. In the <i>lhca6</i> mutant, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of the peak III complex was impaired, suggesting that SubB interacted with Lhca6 during the step of SubB assembly. The process of supercomplex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion was triggered before the completion of the NDH assembly. Consistent with its predicted function, CRR3 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated in young leaves, where the NDH complex was assembled.</p>

Phospholipid:Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase-Mediated Triacylglyerol Synthesis Augments Basal Thermotolerance
<p>High temperatures rapidly induce a genetically programmed heat-shock response (HSR) that is essential to establish short-term acquired thermotolerance. In addition, an immediate HSR-independent metabolic response is triggered, resulting in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of unsaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs) in the cytosol. The metabolic processes involved in heat-induced TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in plants and their physiological significance remain to be clarified. Lipidomic analyses of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings indicated that during heat stress, polyunsaturated fatty acids from thylakoid galactolipids are incorporated into cytosolic TAGs. In addition, rapid conversion of plastidic monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) into oligogalactolipids, acylated MGDGs, and diacylglycerols (DAGs), the direct precursor of TAGs, was observed. For TAG synthesis, DAG requires a fatty acid from the acyl-CoA pool or phosphatidylcholine. Since seedlings deficient in PHOSPHOLIPID:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (PDAT1) were unable to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ate TAGs after heat stress, phosphatidylcholine appears to be the major fatty acid donor. Results suggest that rapid plastid lipid metabolism drives TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation during heat stress. PDAT1-mediated TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation was found to increase heat resistance, since nonacclimated <i>pdat1</i> mutant seedlings were more sensitive to severe heat stress, as indicated by a more dramatic decline of the maximum efficiency of PSII and lower seedling survival compared to wild-type seedlings. In contrast, nonacclimated <i>trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1</i> (<i>tgd1</i>) mutants over<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ating TAGs and oligogalactolipids were more resistant to heat stress. Hence, thylakoid lipid metabolism and TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion increases thermotolerance in addition to the genetically encoded HSR.</p>

Cytokinin Biosynthesis Promotes Cortical Cell Responses during Nodule Development
<p>Legume mutants have shown the requirement for receptor-mediated cytokinin signaling in symbiotic nodule organogenesis. While the receptors are central regulators, cytokinin also is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated during early phases of symbiotic interaction, but the pathways involved have not yet been fully resolved. To identify the source, timing, and effect of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation, we followed transcript levels of the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway genes in a sliding developmental zone of <i>Lotus japonicus</i> roots. <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> were identified as the major contributors to the first cytokinin burst. The genetic dependence and Nod factor responsiveness of these genes confirm that cytokinin biosynthesis is a key target of the common symbiosis pathway. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> transcripts occurs independent of the <i>LjLhk1</i> receptor during nodulation. Together with the rapid repression of both genes by cytokinin, this indicates that <i>LjIpt2</i> and <i>LjLog4</i> contribute to, rather than respond to, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al cytokinin buildup. Analysis of the cytokinin response using the synthetic cytokinin sensor, <i>TCSn</i>, showed that this response occurs in cortical cells before spreading to the epidermis in <i>L. japonicus</i>. While mutant analysis identified redundancy in several biosynthesis families, we found that mutation of <i>LjIpt4</i> limits nodule numbers. Overexpression of <i>LjIpt3</i> or <i>LjLog4</i> alone was insufficient to produce the robust <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of spontaneous nodules. In contrast, overexpressing a complete cytokinin biosynthesis pathway leads to large, often fused spontaneous nodules. These results show the importance of cytokinin biosynthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ating and balancing the requirement for cortical cell activation without uncontrolled cell proliferation.</p>

Higher Novel L-Cys Degradation Activity Results in Lower Organic-S and Biomass in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than the Related Saltwort, <i>Salicornia</i>
<p><i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcocornia</i> are almost identical halophytes whose edible succulent shoots hold promise for commercial production in saline water. Enhanced sulfur nutrition may be beneficial to crops naturally grown on high sulfate. However, little is known about sulfate nutrition in halophytes. Here we show that <i>Salicornia europaea</i> (ecotype RN) exhibits a significant increase in biomass and organic-S <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in response to supplemental sulfate, whereas <i>Sarcocornia fruticosa</i> (ecotype VM) does not, instead exhibiting increased sulfate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. We investigated the role of two pathways on organic-S and biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in <i>Salicornia</i> and <i>Sarcoconia</i>: the sulfate reductive pathway that generates Cys and <sc>l</sc>-Cys desulfhydrase that degrades Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, and pyruvate. The major function of <i>O</i>-acetyl-Ser-(thiol) lyase (OAS-TL; EC 2.5.1.47) is the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of <sc>l</sc>-Cys, but our study shows that the OAS-TL A and OAS-TL B of both halophytes are enzymes that also degrade <sc>l</sc>-Cys to H<sub>2</sub>S. This activity was significantly higher in <i>Sarcocornia</i> than in <i>Salicornia</i>, especially upon sulfate supplementation. The activity of the sulfate reductive pathway key enzyme, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase (APR, EC 1.8.99.2), was significantly higher in <i>Salicornia</i> than in <i>Sarcocornia</i>. These results suggest that the low organic-S level in <i>Sarcocornia</i> is the result of high <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate by OAS-TLs, whereas the greater organic-S and biomass <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in <i>Salicornia</i> is the result of higher APR activity and low <sc>l</sc>-Cys degradation rate, resulting in higher net Cys biosynthesis.

Identification and Metabolite Profiling of Chemical Activators of Lipid Accumulation in Green Algae
<p>Microalgae are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing biofuels and coproducts. However, several limitations must be overcome before algae-based production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this barrier, a chemical genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 compounds were screened against <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, and 243 compounds were identified that increase triacylglyceride (TAG) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation without terminating growth. Identified compounds were classified by structural similarity, and 15 were selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth fitness, photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch concentrations. TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation was verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification of total fatty acids, and targeted TAG and galactolipid measurements were performed using liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry. These results demonstrated that TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation does not necessarily proceed at the expense of galactolipid. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into pathway shifts due to five different compound treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic stresses commonly used to induce oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in algae. The efficacy of these compounds also was demonstrated in three other algal species. These lipid-inducing compounds offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the biochemical mechanisms of lipid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in algae and a direct means to improve algal oil content independent of the severe growth limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.</p>

Cuticle Biosynthesis in Tomato Leaves Is Developmentally Regulated by Abscisic Acid
<p>The expansion of aerial organs in plants is coupled with the synthesis and deposition of a hydrophobic cuticle, composed of cutin and waxes, which is critically important in limiting water loss. While the abiotic stress-related hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is known to up-regulate wax <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in response to drought, the hormonal regulation of cuticle biosynthesis during organ ontogeny is poorly understood. To address the hypothesis that ABA also mediates cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion during organ development, we assessed the effect of ABA deficiency on cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in three ABA biosynthesis-impaired tomato mutants. The mutant leaf cuticles were thinner, had structural abnormalities, and had a substantial reduction in levels of cutin. ABA deficiency also consistently resulted in differences in the composition of leaf cutin and cuticular waxes. Exogenous application of ABA partially rescued these phenotypes, confirming that they were a consequence of reduced ABA levels. The ABA mutants also showed reduced expression of genes involved in cutin or wax <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. This difference was again countered by exogenous ABA, further indicating regulation of cuticle biosynthesis by ABA. The fruit cuticles were affected differently by the ABA-associated mutations, but in general were thicker. However, no structural abnormalities were observed, and the cutin and wax compositions were less affected than in leaf cuticles, suggesting that ABA action influences cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion in an organ-dependent manner. These results suggest dual roles for ABA in regulating leaf cuticle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion: one that is fundamentally associated with leaf expansion, independent of abiotic stress, and another that is drought induced.</p>

MYB89 Transcription Factor Represses Seed Oil Accumulation
<p>In many higher plants, seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation is precisely controlled by intricate multilevel regulatory networks, among which transcriptional regulation mainly influences oil biosynthesis. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the master positive transcription factors, <i>WRINKLED1</i> (<i>WRI1</i>) and <i>LEAFY COTYLEDON1-LIKE</i> (<i>L1L</i>), are important for seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. We found that an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, MYB89, was expressed predominantly in developing seeds during maturation. Oil and major fatty acid biosynthesis in seeds was significantly promoted by <i>myb89-1</i> mutation and <i>MYB89</i> knockdown; thus, MYB89 was an important repressor during seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. RNA sequencing revealed remarkable up-regulation of numerous genes involved in seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in <i>myb89</i> seeds at 12 d after pollination. Posttranslational activation of a MYB89-glucocorticoid receptor fusion protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that MYB89 inhibited seed oil <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation by directly repressing <i>WRI1</i> and five key genes and by indirectly suppressing <i>L1L</i> and 11 key genes involved in oil biosynthesis during seed maturation.

Baseline characteristics among patients with nonshockable-turned-shockable rhythms were balanced across treatment arms, except that recipients of a placebo included fewer men and were less likely to receive bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Active-drug recipients in this cohort required fewer shocks, supplemental doses of their assigned drug, and ancillary antiarrhythmic drugs than recipients of a placebo (<i>P</i><0.05). In all, 16 (4.1%) amiodarone, 11 (3.1%) lidocaine, and 6 (1.9%) placebo-treated patients survived to hospital discharge (<i>P</i>=0.24). No significant interaction between treatment assignment and discharge survival occurred with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ating OHCA rhythm (asystole, pulseless electric activity, or VF/VT). Survival in each of these categories was consistently higher with active drugs, although the trends were not statistically significant.

Self-assembly of lattices with high structural complexity from a geometrically simple molecule
<p>Here we report an anomalous porous molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> built of C–H···N-bonded double-layered roof-floor components and wall components of a segregatively interdigitated architecture. This complicated porous structure consists of only one type of fully aromatic multijoint molecule carrying three identical dipyridylphenyl wedges. Despite its high symmetry, this molecule accomplishes difficult tasks by using two of its three wedges for roof-floor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and using its other wedge for wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. Although a C–H···N bond is extremely labile, the porous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> maintains its porosity until thermal breakdown of the C–H···N bonds at 202°C occurs, affording a nonporous polymorph. Though this nonporous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> survives even at 325°C, it can retrieve the parent porosity under acetonitrile vapor. These findings show how one can translate simplicity into ultrahigh complexity.</p>

Resonance-stabilized hydrocarbon-radical chain reactions may explain soot inception and growth
<p>Mystery surrounds the transition from gas-phase hydrocarbon precursors to terrestrial soot and interstellar dust, which are carbonaceous particles formed under similar conditions. Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are known precursors to high-temperature carbonaceous-particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, the molecular pathways that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ate particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion are unknown. We present experimental and theoretical evidence for rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecular clust</span></strong>ering–reaction pathways involving radicals with extended conjugation. These radicals react with other hydrocarbon species to form covalently bound complexes that promote further growth and clustering by regenerating resonance-stabilized radicals through low-barrier hydrogen-abstraction and hydrogen-ejection reactions. Such radical–chain reaction pathways may lead to covalently bound clusters of PAHs and other hydrocarbons that would otherwise be too small to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">condens</span></strong>e at high temperatures, thus providing the key mechanistic steps for rapid particle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and surface growth by hydrocarbon chemisorption.</p>

Defective cholesterol clearance limits remyelination in the aged central nervous system
<p>Age-associated decline in regeneration capacity limits the restoration of nervous system functionality after injury. In a model for demyelination, we found that old mice fail to resolve the inflammatory response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated after myelin damage. Aged phagocytes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated excessive amounts of myelin debris, which triggered cholesterol <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and phagolysosomal membrane rupture and stimulated inflammasomes.

Stimulation of reverse cholesterol transport was sufficient to restore the capacity of old mice to remyelinate lesioned tissue. Thus, cholesterol-rich myelin debris can overwhelm the efflux capacity of phagocytes, resulting in a phase transition of cholesterol into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>s and thereby inducing a maladaptive immune response that impedes tissue regeneration.</p>

Reducing the stochasticity of crystal nucleation to enable subnanosecond memory writing
<p>Operation speed is a key challenge in phase-change random-access memory (PCRAM) technology, especially for achieving subnanosecond high-speed cache memory. Commercialized PCRAM products are limited by the tens of nanoseconds writing speed, originating from the stochastic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> nucleation during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization of amorphous germanium antimony telluride<i> </i>(Ge<sub>2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>5</sub>). Here, we demonstrate an alloying strategy to speed up the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization kinetics. The scandium antimony telluride (Sc<sub>0.2</sub>Sb<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) compound that we designed allows a writing speed of only 700 picoseconds without preprogramming in a large conventional PCRAM device. This ultrafast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong>lization stems from the reduced stochasticity of nucleation through geometrically matched and robust scandium telluride (ScTe) chemical bonds that stabilize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> precursors in the amorphous state. Controlling nucleation through alloy design paves the way for the development of cache-type PCRAM technology to boost the working efficiency of computing systems.</p>

Supersonic gas streams enhance the formation of massive black holes in the early universe

The methanogenic CO<sub>2</sub> reducing-and-fixing enzyme is bifunctional and contains 46 [4Fe-4S] clusters
<p>Biological methane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion starts with a challenging adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–independent carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) fixation process. We explored this enzymatic process by solving the x-ray <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crystal</span></strong> structure of formyl-methanofuran dehydrogenase, determined here as Fwd(ABCDFG)<sub>2</sub> and Fwd(ABCDFG)<sub>4</sub> complexes, from <i>Methanothermobacter wolfeii</i>. The latter 800-kilodalton apparatus consists of four peripheral catalytic sections and an electron-supplying core with 46 electronically coupled [4Fe-4S] clusters. Catalysis is separately performed by subunits FwdBD (FwdB and FwdD), which are related to tungsten-containing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>e dehydrogenase, and subunit FwdA, a binuclear metal center carrying amidohydrolase.

Genetic Dissection of Fe-Dependent Signaling in Root Developmental Responses to Phosphate Deficiency
<p>The inhibition of primary root (PR) growth is a major developmental response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Previous studies have independently uncovered key roles of the LOW PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (LPR1) ferroxidase, the tonoplast-localized ALUMINUM SENSITIVE3 (ALS3)/SENSITIVE TO ALUMINUM RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STAR1) transporter complex, and the SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1; a transcription factor)-ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (ALMT1; a malate transporter) regulatory module in mediating this response by controlling iron (Fe) homeostasis in roots, but how these three components interact to regulate PR growth under Pi deficiency remains unknown. Here, we dissected genetic relationships among these three key components and found that (1) STOP1, ALMT1, and LPR1 act downstream of ALS3/STAR1 in controlling PR growth under Pi deficiency; (2) ALS3/STAR1 inhibits the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway by repressing STOP1 protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in the nucleus; and (3) STOP1-ALMT1 and LPR1 control PR growth under Pi deficiency in an interdependent manner involving the promotion of malate-dependent Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in roots. Furthermore, this malate-mediated Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation depends on external Pi availability. We also performed a detailed analysis of the dynamic changes in the tissue-specific Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation patterns in the root tips of plants exposed to Pi deficiency. The results indicate that the degree of inhibition of PR growth induced by Pi deficiency is not linked to the level of Fe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated in the root apical meristem or the elongation zone. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism that regulates the root developmental response to Pi deficiency.</p>

Chloroplast Accumulation Response Enhances Leaf Photosynthesis and Plant Biomass Production
<p>Under high light intensity, chloroplasts avoid absorbing excess light by moving to anticlinal cell walls (avoidance response), but under low light intensity, chloroplasts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ate along periclinal cell walls (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation response). In most plant species, these responses are induced by blue light and are mediated by the blue light photoreceptor, phototropin, which also regulates phototropism, leaf flattening, and stomatal opening. These phototropin-mediated responses could enhance photosynthesis and biomass production. Here, using various Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants deficient in chloroplast movement, we demonstrated that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation response enhances leaf photosynthesis and plant biomass production. Conspicuously, <i>phototropin2</i> mutant plants specifically defective in the avoidance response but not in other phototropin-mediated responses displayed a constitutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation response irrespective of light intensities, enhanced leaf photosynthesis, and increased plant biomass production. Therefore, our findings provide clear experimental evidence of the importance of the chloroplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation response in leaf photosynthesis and biomass production.</p>

Transcriptional Roadmap to Seasonal Variation in Wood Formation of Norway Spruce
<p>Seasonal cues influence several aspects of the secondary growth of tree stems, including cambial activity, wood chemistry, and transition to latewood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. We investigated seasonal changes in cambial activity, secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, and tracheid cell death in woody tissues of Norway spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) throughout one seasonal cycle. RNA sequencing was performed simultaneously in both the xylem and cambium/phloem tissues of the stem. Principal component analysis revealed gradual shifts in the transcriptomes that followed a chronological order throughout the season. A notable remodeling of the transcriptome was observed in the winter, with many genes having maximal expression during the coldest months of the year. A highly coexpressed set of monolignol biosynthesis genes showed high expression during the period of secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion as well as a second peak in midwinter. This midwinter peak in expression did not trigger lignin deposition, as determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Coexpression consensus network analyses suggested the involvement of transcription factors belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES and MYELOBLASTOSIS-HOMEOBOX families in the seasonal control of secondary cell wall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of tracheids. Interestingly, the lifetime of the latewood tracheids stretched beyond the winter dormancy period, correlating with a lack of cell death-related gene expression. Our transcriptomic analyses combined with phylogenetic and microscopic analyses also identified the cellulose and lignin biosynthetic genes and putative regulators for latewood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and tracheid cell death in Norway spruce, providing a toolbox for further physiological and functional assays of these important phase transitions.</p>

Roles of miR319 and TCP Transcription Factors in Leaf Development
<p>Sophisticated regulation of gene expression, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes, is required for leaf differentiation, growth, and senescence. The impact of miR319 and its target <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i>, <i>CYCLOIDEA</i>, and <i>PROLIFERATING CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN BINDING FACTOR</i> (<i>TCP</i>) genes on leaf development has been extensively investigated, but the redundancies of these gene families often interfere with the evaluation of their function and regulation in the developmental context. Here, we present the genetic evidence of the involvement of the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaf development. Single mutations in <i>MIR319A</i> and <i>MIR319B</i> genes moderately inhibited the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of leaf serrations, whereas double mutations increased the extent of this inhibition and resulted in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of smooth leaves. Mutations in <i>MIR319</i> and gain-of-function mutations in the <i>TCP4</i> gene conferred resistance against miR319 and impaired the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. These mutations functionally associated with <i>CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON</i> genes, which regulate the cotyledon boundary and leaf serration <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in miR319-targeted and nontargeted <i>TCP</i> genes cooperatively induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion of serrated leaves in addition to changes in the levels of their downstream gene transcript. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the <i>MIR319</i> and <i>TCP</i> gene families underlie robust and multilayer control of leaf development. This study also provides a framework toward future researches on redundant miRNAs and transcription factors in Arabidopsis and crop plants.</p>

Transcription Factor AREB2 Is Involved in Soluble Sugar Accumulation by Activating Sugar Transporter and Amylase Genes
<p>Sugars play important roles in plant growth and development, crop yield and quality, as well as responses to abiotic stresses. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a multifunctional hormone. However, the exact mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation is largely unknown in plants. Here, we tested the expression profile of several sugar transporter and amylase genes in response to ABA treatment. <i>MdSUT2</i> and <i>MdAREB2</i> were isolated and genetically transformed into apple (<i>Malus domestica</i>) to investigate their roles in ABA-induced sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. The MdAREB2 transcription factor was found to bind to the promoters of the sugar transporter and amylase genes and activate their expression.

Furthermore, MdAREB2 promoted the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of sucrose and soluble sugars in an <i>MdSUT2</i>-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the ABA-responsive transcription factor MdAREB2 directly activates the expression of amylase and sugar transporter genes to promote soluble sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation, suggesting a mechanism by which ABA regulates sugar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in plants.</p>

Ubiquitin-Proteasome Dependent Regulation of the GOLDEN2-LIKE 1 Transcription Factor in Response to Plastid Signals
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) GOLDEN2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors promote chloroplast biogenesis by regulating the expression of photosynthesis-related genes. Arabidopsis GLK1 is also known to participate in retrograde signaling from chloroplasts to the nucleus. To elucidate the mechanism by which GLK1 is regulated in response to plastid signals, we biochemically characterized Arabidopsis GLK1 protein. Expression analysis of GLK1 protein indicated that GLK1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ates in aerial tissues. Both tissue-specific and Suc-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of GLK1 were regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. In contrast, norflurazon- or lincomycin-treated <i>gun1</i>-<i>101</i> mutant expressing normal levels of <i>GLK1</i> mRNA failed to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ate GLK1 protein, suggesting that plastid signals directly regulate the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of GLK1 protein in a GUN1-independent manner. Treatment of the <i>glk1glk2</i> mutant expressing functional GFP-GLK1 with a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of polyubiquitinated GFP-GLK1. Furthermore, the level of endogenous GLK1 in plants with damaged plastids was partially restored when those plants were treated with MG-132. Collectively, these data indicate that the ubiquitin-proteasome system participates in the degradation of Arabidopsis GLK1 in response to plastid signals.</p>

Distinct Mechanisms of the ORANGE Protein in Controlling Carotenoid Flux
<p>β-Carotene adds nutritious value and determines the color of many fruits, including melon (<i>Cucumis melo</i>). In melon mesocarp, β-carotene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation is governed by the <i>Orange</i> gene (<i>CmOr</i>) golden single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) through a yet to be discovered mechanism. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), OR increases carotenoid levels by posttranscriptionally regulating phytoene synthase (PSY). Here, we identified a <i>CmOr</i> nonsense mutation (<i>Cmor</i>-lowβ) that lowered fruit β-carotene levels with impaired chromoplast biogenesis. <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ exerted a minimal effect on <i>PSY</i> transcripts but dramatically decreased PSY protein levels and enzymatic activity, leading to reduced carotenoid metabolic flux and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. However, the golden SNP was discovered to not affect PSY protein levels and carotenoid metabolic flux in melon fruit, as shown by carotenoid and immunoblot analyses of selected melon genotypes and by using chemical pathway inhibitors. The high β-carotene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in golden SNP melons was found to be due to a reduced further metabolism of β-carotene. This was revealed by genetic studies with double mutants including <i>carotenoid isomerase</i> (<i>yofi</i>), a carotenoid-isomerase nonsense mutant, which arrests the turnover of prolycopene. The <i>yofi</i> F2 segregants <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ated prolycopene independently of the golden SNP. Moreover, <i>Cmor</i>-lowβ was found to inhibit chromoplast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and chloroplast disintegration in fruits from 30 d after anthesis until ripening, suggesting that <i>CmOr</i> regulates the chloroplast-to-chromoplast transition. Taken together, our results demonstrate that <i>CmOr</i> is required to achieve PSY protein levels to maintain carotenoid biosynthesis metabolic flux but that the mechanism of the <i>CmOr</i> golden SNP involves an inhibited metabolism downstream of β-carotene to dramatically affect both carotenoid content and plastid fate.</p>

OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 Function as Arsenate Reductases and Regulate Arsenic Accumulation<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Rice is a major dietary source of the toxic metalloid arsenic (As). Reducing its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) grain is of critical importance to food safety. Rice roots take up arsenate and arsenite depending on the prevailing soil conditions. The first step of arsenate detoxification is its reduction to arsenite, but the enzyme(s) catalyzing this reaction in rice remains unknown. Here, we identify OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 as arsenate reductases in rice. <i>OsHAC1;1</i> and <i>OsHAC1;2</i> are able to complement an <i>Escherichia coli</i> mutant lacking the endogenous arsenate reductase and to reduce arsenate to arsenite. <i>OsHAC1:1</i> and <i>OsHAC1;2</i> are predominantly expressed in roots, with <i>OsHAC1;1</i> being abundant in the epidermis, root hairs, and pericycle cells while <i>OsHAC1;2</i> is abundant in the epidermis, outer layers of cortex, and endodermis cells. Expression of the two genes was induced by arsenate exposure. Knocking out <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> decreased the reduction of arsenate to arsenite in roots, reducing arsenite efflux to the external medium. Loss of arsenite efflux was also associated with increased As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in shoots. Greater effects were observed in a double mutant of the two genes. In contrast, overexpression of either <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> increased arsenite efflux, reduced As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation, and enhanced arsenate tolerance. When grown under aerobic soil conditions, overexpression of either <i>OsHAC1;1</i> or <i>OsHAC1;2</i> also decreased As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in rice grain, whereas grain As increased in the knockout mutants. We conclude that OsHAC1;1 and OsHAC1;2 are arsenate reductases that play an important role in restricting As <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in rice shoots and grain.</p>

An NADPH-Oxidase/Polyamine Oxidase Feedback Loop Controls Oxidative Burst Under Salinity

However, it is yet unclear whether apoplastic PAO is part of a network that coordinates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under salinity or if it acts independently. Here, we unravel that NADPH oxidase and apoplastic PAO cooperate to control the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxides (O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>) in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>). To examine to what extent apoplastic PAO constitutes part of a ROS-generating network, we examined ROS <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in guard cells of plants overexpressing or down-regulating apoplastic PAO (lines S2.2 and A2, respectively) or down-regulating NADPH oxidase (line AS-<i>NtRbohD</i>/<i>F</i>). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed that, under salinity, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> increased in S2.2 and decreased in A2 compared with the wild type. Surprisingly, the O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup>-specific probe benzene sulfonyl-So showed that O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> levels correlated positively with that of apoplastic PAO (i.e. showed high and low levels in S2.2 and A2, respectively). By using AS-<i>NtRbohD/F</i> lines and a pharmacological approach, we could show that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>·−</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation at the onset of salinity stress was dependent on NADPH oxidase, indicating that NADPH oxidase is upstream of apoplastic PAO. Our results suggest that NADPH oxidase and the apoplastic PAO form a feed-forward ROS amplification loop, which impinges on oxidative state and culminates in the execution of programmed cell death. We propose that the PAO/NADPH oxidase loop is a central hub in the plethora of responses controlling salt stress tolerance, with potential functions extending beyond stress tolerance.</p>

Duration of Prehospital Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Favorable Neurological Outcomes for Pediatric Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The appropriate duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs) remains unclear and may differ based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al rhythm. We aimed to determine the relationship between the duration of prehospital CPR by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel and post-OHCA outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We analyzed the records of 12 877 pediatric patients who experienced OHCAs (<18 years of age). Data were recorded in a nationwide Japanese database between 2005 and 2012. Study end points were 30-day survival and 30-day survival with favorable neurological outcomes (Cerebral Performance Category [CPC] scale 1–2). Prehospital EMS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated CPR duration was defined as the time from CPR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ation by EMS personnel to prehospital return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or to hospital arrival when prehospital ROSC was not achieved during prehospital CPR efforts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The rates of 30-day survival and 30-day CPC 1 to 2 were 9.1% (n=1167) and 2.5% (n=325), respectively. Prehospital EMS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated CPR duration was significantly and inversely associated with 30-day outcomes (adjusted odds ratio for 1-minute increments: 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.93–0.95 for survival; adjusted odds ratio: 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.88–0.92 for CPC 1–2). The duration of prehospital EMS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated CPR, beyond which the chance for favorable outcomes diminished to <1%, was 42 minutes for each key outcome, 30-day survival, and 30-day survival with CPC 1 to 2. When categorized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al rhythm, the prehospital EMS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated CPR durations beyond which the chance for 30-day survival with CPC 1 to 2 diminished to <1% were 39 minutes for shockable rhythms, 42 minutes for pulseless electric activity, and 46 minutes for asystole, respectively. In patients with bystander-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated CPR, the prehospital CPR duration, beyond which the chance for favorable outcome diminished to <1%, was 46 minutes from call receipt.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Prehospital EMS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated CPR duration for pediatric OHCAs was independently and inversely associated with 30-day favorable outcomes. The duration of prehospital EMS-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>ated CPR, beyond which the chance for 30-day favorable outcomes diminished to <1%, was 42 minutes. However, the CPR duration to achieve this proportion of outcomes differed based on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>al rhythm.

Non-Enzymatic Synthesis of Bioactive Isoprostanoids in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i> following Oxidative Stress
<p>The ecological success of diatoms requires a remarkable ability to survive many types of stress, including variations in temperature, light, salinity, and nutrient availability. On exposure to these stresses, diatoms exhibit common responses, including growth arrest, impairment of photosynthesis, production of reactive oxygen species, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of triacylglycerol (TAG). We studied the production of cyclopentane oxylipins derived from fatty acids in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> in response to oxidative stress. <i>P. tricornutum</i> lacks the enzymatic pathway for producing cyclopentane-oxylipins, such as jasmonate, prostaglandins, or thromboxanes. In cells subjected to increasing doses of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), we detected nonenzymatic production of isoprostanoids, including six phytoprostanes, three F<sub>2t</sub>-isoprostanes, two F<sub>3t</sub>-isoprostanes, and three F<sub>4t</sub>-neuroprostanes, by radical peroxidation of α-linolenic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexanoic acids, respectively. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also triggered photosynthesis impairment and TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation. F<sub>1t</sub>-phytoprostanes constitute the major class detected (300 pmol per 1 million cells; intracellular concentration, ∼4 µ<sc>m</sc>). Only two glycerolipids, phosphatidylcholine and diacylglycerylhydroxymethyl-trimethyl-alanine, could provide all substrates for these isoprostanoids. Treatment of <i>P. tricornutum</i> with nine synthetic isoprostanoids produced an effect in the micromolar range, marked by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of TAG and reduced growth, without affecting photosynthesis. Therefore, the emission of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and free radicals upon exposure to stresses can lead to glycerolipid peroxidation and nonenzymatic synthesis of isoprostanoids, inhibiting growth and contributing to the induction of TAG <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation via unknown processes. This characterization of nonenzymatic oxylipins in <i>P. tricornutum</i> opens a field of research on the study of processes controlled by isoprostanoid signaling in various physiological and environmental contexts in diatoms.</p>

Singlet Oxygen Plays an Essential Role in the Root’s Response to Osmotic Stress
<p>The high osmotic potentials in plants subjected to drought stress can be mimicked by the application of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol. Here, we quantified the effects of exposure to polyethylene glycol on the growth of the main and lateral roots of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) seedlings. The effects on root growth were highly correlated with the appearance of singlet oxygen, as visualized using the singlet oxygen-specific probe singlet oxygen sensor green. The production of singlet oxygen was followed by cell death, as indicated by the intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of propidium iodide due to the loss of membrane integrity. Cell death began in the epidermal region of the root tip and spread in a dynamic manner to meristematic sections. In parallel, gene expression changes specific to the presence of singlet oxygen were observed. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of other reactive oxygen species, namely hydrogen, peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide, did not correlate with cell death. In addition, both the singlet oxygen scavenger His and the lipoxygenase inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid specifically inhibited singlet oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and cell death. These results suggest a light-independent, type-I source of singlet oxygen production. Serpin-protease interactions were used as a model to assess the possibility of vacuolar-type cell death. Osmotic stress induced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of complexes between the cytoplasmic serpin AtSERPIN1 and its cognate vacuolar proteases, indicating that vacuolar integrity was compromised. These findings imply that singlet oxygen plays an essential role in conveying the root response to osmotic stress.</p>

MicroRNA166 Modulates Cadmium Tolerance and Accumulation in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20- to 24-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. Several plant miRNAs, such as miR166, have vital roles in plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses. One such environmental stress encountered by crop plants is exposure to cadmium (Cd), an element highly toxic to most organisms, including humans and plants. In this study, we analyzed the role of miR166 in Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and tolerance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The expression levels of miR166 in both root and leaf tissues were significantly higher in the reproductive stage than in the seedling stage in rice. The expression of miR166 in the roots of rice seedlings was reduced after Cd treatment. Overexpression of miR166 in rice improved Cd tolerance, a result associated with the reduction of Cd-induced oxidative stress in transgenic rice plants. Furthermore, overexpression of miR166 reduced both Cd translocation from roots to shoots and Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in the grains. miR166 targets genes encoding the class-III homeodomain-Leu zipper (HD-Zip) family proteins in plants. In rice, <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>) gene (Os03g43930), which encodes an HD-Zip protein, was up-regulated by Cd treatment but down-regulated by overexpression of miR166 in transgenic rice plants. Overexpression of <i>OsHB4</i> increased Cd sensitivity and Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation in the leaves and grains of transgenic rice plants. By contrast, silencing <i>OsHB4</i> by RNA interference enhanced Cd tolerance in transgenic rice plants. These results indicate a critical role for miR166 in Cd <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation and tolerance through regulation of its target gene, <i>OsHB4</i>, in rice.</p>

Jasmonic Acid Inhibits Auxin-Induced Lateral Rooting Independently of the CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 Receptor
<p>Plant root systems are indispensable for water uptake, nutrient acquisition, and anchoring plants in the soil. Previous studies using auxin inhibitors def<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">initi</span></strong>vely established that auxin plays a central role regulating root growth and development. Most auxin inhibitors affect all auxin signaling at the same time, which obscures an understanding of individual events. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a lateral root (LR)-preferential auxin inhibitor in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) in a manner that is independent of the JA receptor, CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 (COI1). Treatment of wild-type Arabidopsis with either (−)-JA or (+)-JA reduced primary root length and LR number; the reduction of LR number was also observed in <i>coi1</i> mutants. Treatment of seedlings with (−)-JA or (+)-JA suppressed auxin-inducible genes related to LR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion, diminished <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">accumul</span></strong>ation of the auxin reporter <i>DR5::GUS</i>, and inhibited auxin-dependent DII-VENUS degradation. A structural mimic of (−)-JA and (+)-coronafacic acid also inhibited LR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion and stabilized DII-VENUS protein. COI1-independent activity was retained in the double mutant of <i>transport inhibitor response1</i> and <i>auxin signaling f-box protein2</i> (<i>tir1 afb2</i>) but reduced in the <i>afb5</i> single mutant. These results reveal JAs and (+)-coronafacic acid to be selective counter-auxins, a finding that could lead to new approaches for studying the mechanisms of LR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">format</span></strong>ion.</p>

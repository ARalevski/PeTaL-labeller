p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Many of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics are highly stereotyped, such as oscillations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance oscillated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

Disparities in science literacy
<p>Much is known about how adult <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy varies internationally and over time, and about its association with attitudes and beliefs. However, less is known about disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy across racial and ethnic groups (<i>1</i>). This is particularly surprising in light of substantial research on racial and ethnic disparities in related areas such as educational achievement, math and reading ability (<i>2</i>), representation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) occupations (<i>3</i>), and health literacy (<i>4</i>). Given the importance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy to securing and sustaining many jobs, to understanding key health concepts to enhance quality of life, and to increasing public engagement in societal decision-making (<i>5</i>), it is concerning if the distribution of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy is unequally stratified, particularly if this stratification reflects broader patterns of disadvantage and cultural dominance as experienced by minorities and educationally underserved populations. We describe here such disparities in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy in the United States and attempt to explain underlying drivers, concluding that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e literacy disadvantage among black and Hispanic adults relative to whites is only partially explained by measures of broader, foundational literacies and socioeconomic status (SES).</p>

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The influence of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) diurnally and during dehydration on stomatal conductance and photosynthesis remains unclear. Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during dehydration; (2) its basis in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem pathways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics on irradiance; (4) its impact on diurnal patterns of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas exchange and survival under simulated drought regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong vulnerability to dehydration diurnally in both gas exchange and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced sensitivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to dehydration. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher irradiance in well-hydrated leaves across the full range of water potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> vulnerability was observed. Modeling indicated that responses to dehydration and irradiance are likely attributable to changes in membrane permeability and that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> would contribute strongly to stomatal closure, improving performance, survival, and efficient water use during drought. These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic traits and their influence on gas exchange during dehydration.</p>

From oncogenic mutation to dynamic code
<p>Signal transduction pathways (STPs) convert biochemical reactions into precise and reproducible biological outcomes. These functions are performed reliably and reproducibly against a background of noise (variation) arising from the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions (<i>1</i>). Indeed, information theory analysis of STPs indicates that they have a limited capacity to discriminate information, including different ligands or different activation states of components (<i>2</i>). However, this discrimination is dramatically enhanced by adding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic information, such as signal rise time, signal duration, amplitude, and decay rate (<i>3</i>). The observation that differential activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway can determine whether rat pheochromocytoma cells proliferate or differentiate was reported more than 20 years ago (<i>4</i>), and evidence has since accumulated that STP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics control cell fate decisions. However, we are still struggling to understand how signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics is encoded and decoded and how pathological changes, such as the expression of mutant proteins, affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic STP code. On page 892 of this issue, Bugaj <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) make use of new tools with which to decipher this code and reveal how certain cancer-associated BRAF mutations can corrupt the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic STP code and trick cells into unlicensed proliferation.</p>

Xylem Sap Surface Tension May Be Crucial for Hydraulic Safety
<p>The surface tension (γ) of xylem sap plays a key role in stabilizing air-water interfaces at the pits between water- and gas-filled conduits to avoid air seeding at low water potentials. We studied seasonal changes in xylem sap γ in <i>Picea abies</i> and <i>Pinus mugo</i> growing at the alpine timberline. We analyzed their vulnerability to drought-induced embolism using solutions of different γ and estimated the potential effect of seasonal changes in γ on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability. In both species, xylem sap γ showed distinct seasonal courses between about 50 and 68 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. Solutions with low γ caused higher vulnerability to drought-induced xylem embolism. The water potential at 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity in <i>P. abies</i> and <i>P. mugo</i> was −3.35 and −3.86 MPa at γ of 74 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup> but −2.11 and −2.09 MPa at 45 m<sc>n</sc> m<sup>−1</sup>. This indicates up to about 1 MPa seasonal variation in 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity. The results revealed pronounced effects of changes in xylem sap γ on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic safety of trees in situ. These effects also are relevant in vulnerability analyses, where the use of standard solutions with high γ overestimates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic safety. Thus, γ should be considered carefully in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic studies.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and control their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal control of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydromechan</span></strong>ical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal control in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

Evidence for Hydraulic Vulnerability Segmentation and Lack of Xylem Refilling under Tension
<p>The vascular system of grapevine (<i>Vitis</i> spp.) has been reported as being highly vulnerable, even though grapevine regularly experiences seasonal drought. Consequently, stomata would remain open below water potentials that would generate a high loss of stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity via xylem embolism. This situation would necessitate daily cycles of embolism repair to restore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic function. However, a more parsimonious explanation is that some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic techniques are prone to artifacts in species with long vessels, leading to the overestimation of vulnerability. The aim of this study was to provide an unbiased assessment of (1) the vulnerability to drought-induced embolism in perennial and annual organs and (2) the ability to refill embolized vessels in two <i>Vitis</i> species X-ray micro-computed tomography observations of intact plants indicated that both <i>Vitis</i> <i>vinifera</i> and <i>Vitis</i> <i>riparia</i> were relatively vulnerable, with the pressure inducing 50% loss of stem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity = −1.7 and −1.3 MPa, respectively. In <i>V. vinifera</i>, both the stem and petiole had similar sigmoidal vulnerability curves but differed in pressure inducing 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (−1.7 and −1 MPa for stem and petiole, respectively). Refilling was not observed as long as bulk xylem pressure remained negative (e.g. at the apical part of the plants; −0.11 ± 0.02 MPa) and change in percentage loss of conductivity was 0.02% ± 0.01%. However, positive xylem pressure was observed at the basal part of the plant (0.04 ± 0.01 MPa), leading to a recovery of conductance (change in percentage loss of conductivity = −0.24% ± 0.12%). Our findings provide evidence that grapevine is unable to repair embolized xylem vessels under negative pressure, but its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability segmentation provides significant protection of the perennial stem.</p>

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The magnetic fields of solar-type stars are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">turbul</span></strong>ent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convect</span></strong>ive layers of stars and have a complex dependency upon stellar rotation rate. We have performed a set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">turbul</span></strong>ent global simulations that exhibit magnetic cycles varying systematically with stellar rotation and luminosity. We find that the magnetic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of rotation on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">turbul</span></strong>ent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convect</span></strong>ion. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>o process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type stars.</p>

Hydraulics Regulate Stomatal Responses to Changes in Leaf Water Status in the Fern <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>
<p>Stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status are important for the diurnal regulation of gas exchange and the survival of plants during drought. These stomatal responses in angiosperm species are well characterized, yet in species of nonseed plants, an ongoing debate surrounds the role of metabolism, particularly the role of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA), in functionally regulating stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status. Here, we measured the stomatal response to changes in vapor pressure difference (VPD) in two natural forms of the fern species <i>Athyrium filix</i>-<i>femina</i>, recently suggested to have stomata that are regulated by ABA. The two forms measured had considerable differences in key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic traits, including leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance and capacitance, as well as the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics of stomatal response to changes in VPD. In both forms, the stomatal responses to VPD could be accurately predicted by a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic, mechanistic model that assumes guard cell turgor changes in concert with leaf turgor in the light, and not via metabolic processes including the level of ABA. During drought, endogenous ABA did not play a role in stomatal closure, and exogenous ABA applied to live, intact leaves did not induce stomatal closure. Our results indicate that functional stomatal responses to changes in leaf water status in ferns are regulated by leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics and not metabolism. With ferns being sister to seed plants, this result has implications for the evolutionary reconstruction of functional stomatal responses across vascular land plant lineages.</p>

Going with the Flow: Multiscale Insights into the Composite Nature of Water Transport in Roots
<p>As water often limits crop production, a more complete understanding of plant water capture and transport is necessary. Here, we developed MECHA, a mathematical model that computes the flow of water across the root at the scale of walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata of individual cells, and used it to test hypotheses related to root water transport in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). The model uses detailed root anatomical descriptions and a minimal set of experimental cell properties, including the conductivity of plasma membranes, cell walls, and plasmodesmata, which yield quantitative and scale-consistent estimations of water pathways and root radial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (<i>k</i><sub>r</sub>). MECHA revealed that the mainstream <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic theories derived independently at the cell and root segment scales are compatible only if osmotic potentials within the apoplastic domains are uniform. The results suggested that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convect</span></strong>ion-diffusion of apoplastic solutes explained most of the offset between estimated <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> in pressure clamp and osmotic experiments, while the contribution of water-filled intercellular spaces was limited. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses quantified the relative impact of cortex and endodermis cell conductivity of plasma membranes on root <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> and suggested that only the latter contributed substantially to <i>k</i><sub>r</sub> due to the composite nature of water flow across roots. The explicit root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic anatomy framework brings insights into contradictory interpretations of experiments from the literature and suggests experiments to efficiently address questions pertaining to root water relations. Its scale consistency opens avenues for cross-scale communication in the world of root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein IQ67 DOMAIN5 Modulates Microtubule Dynamics and Pavement Cell Shape
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic arrangement of cortical microtubules (MTs) plays a pivotal role in controlling cell growth and shape formation in plants, but the mechanisms by which cortical MTs are organized to regulate these processes are not well characterized. In particular, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic behavior of cortical MTs is critical for their spatial organization, yet the molecular mechanisms controlling MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics remain poorly understood. In this study, we used the puzzle piece-shaped pavement cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves as a model system in which to study cortical MT organization. We isolated an ethyl methanesulfonate mutant with reduced interdigitation of pavement cells in cotyledons. This line carried a mutation in <i>IQ67 DOMAIN5</i> (<i>IQD5</i>), which encodes a member of the plant-specific IQ motif protein family. Live-cell imaging and biochemical analyses demonstrated that IQD5 binds to MTs and promotes MT assembly. MT-depolymerizing drug treatment and in vivo MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics assays suggested that IQD5 functions to stabilize MTs. Hence, our findings provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that IQD5 regulates MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics that affect MT organization and subsequent cell shape formation.</p>

Outside-Xylem Vulnerability, Not Xylem Embolism, Controls Leaf Hydraulic Decline during Dehydration<xref><sup>1</sup></xref><xref><sup>[CC-BY]</sup></xref>
<p>Leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic supply is crucial to maintaining open stomata for CO<sub>2</sub> capture and plant growth. During drought-induced dehydration, the leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) declines, which contributes to stomatal closure and, eventually, to leaf death. Previous studies have tended to attribute the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> to embolism in the leaf vein xylem. We visualized at high resolution and quantified experimentally the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability of xylem and outside-xylem pathways and modeled their respective influences on plant water transport. Evidence from all approaches indicated that the decline of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> during dehydration arose first and foremost due to the vulnerability of outside-xylem tissues. In vivo x-ray microcomputed tomography of dehydrating leaves of four diverse angiosperm species showed that, at the turgor loss point, only small fractions of leaf vein xylem conduits were embolized, and substantial xylem embolism arose only under severe dehydration. Experiments on an expanded set of eight angiosperm species showed that outside-xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability explained 75% to 100% of <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline across the range of dehydration from mild water stress to beyond turgor loss point. Spatially explicit modeling of leaf water transport pointed to a role for reduced membrane conductivity consistent with published data for cells and tissues. Plant-scale modeling suggested that outside-xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic vulnerability can protect the xylem from tensions that would induce embolism and disruption of water transport under mild to moderate soil and atmospheric droughts. These findings pinpoint outside-xylem tissues as a central locus for the control of leaf and plant water transport during progressive drought.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong></span></strong>ic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong></span></strong>ic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong></span></strong>ic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong></span></strong>ic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

Cardiac function and infarct size were evaluated by MRI, arrhythmia incidence by implanted loop recorders, and the engraftment rate by calculation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of expression of the human Y chromosome. Additional studies examined the myocardial protein expression profile changes and potential mechanisms of action that related to exosomes from the cell patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The hCMPs began to beat synchronously within 1 day of fabrication, and after 7 days of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture stimulation, in vitro assessments indicated the mechanisms related to the improvements in electronic mechanical coupling, calcium-handling, and force generation, suggesting a maturation process during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture.

Exercise Dynamics in Secondary Mitral Regurgitation

Recovery performance in xylem hydraulic conductivity is correlated with cavitation resistance for temperate deciduous tree species
<p>Woody species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ically vulnerable to xylem cavitation may experience daily xylem embolism. How such species cope with the possibility of accumulated embolism is unclear. In this study, we examined seven temperate woody species to assess the hypothesis that low cavitation resistance (high vulnerability to cavitation) is compensated by high recovery performance via vessel refilling. We also evaluated leaf functional and xylem structural traits. The xylem recovery index (XRI), defined as the ratio of xylem <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity in plants rewatered after soil drought to that in plants under moist conditions, varied among species. The xylem water potential causing 50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (Ψ<sub>50</sub>) varied among the species studied, whereas only a slight difference was detected with respect to midday xylem water potential (Ψ<sub>min</sub>), indicating smaller <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic safety margins (Ψ<sub>min</sub> − Ψ<sub>50</sub>) for species more vulnerable to cavitation. Cavitation resistance (|Ψ<sub>50</sub>|) was negatively correlated with XRI across species, with cavitation-vulnerable species showing a higher performance in xylem recovery. Wood density was positively correlated with cavitation resistance and was negatively correlated with XRI. These novel results reveal that coordination exists between cavitation resistance and xylem recovery performance, in association with wood functional traits such as denser wood for cavitation-resistant xylem and less-dense but water-storable wood for refillable xylem. These findings provide insights into long-term maintenance of water transport in tree species growing under variable environmental conditions.</p>

Exotic states in a simple network of nanoelectromechanical oscillators
<p>Synchronization of oscillators, a phenomenon found in a wide variety of natural and engineered systems, is typically understood through a reduction to a first-order phase model with simplified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Here, by exploiting the precision and flexibility of nanoelectromechanical systems, we examined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of a ring of quasi-sinusoidal oscillators at and beyond first order. Beyond first order, we found exotic states of synchronization with highly complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, including weak chimeras, decoupled states, traveling waves, and inhomogeneous synchronized states. Through theory and experiment, we show that these exotic states rely on complex interactions emerging out of networks with simple linear nearest-neighbor coupling. This work provides insight into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ical richness of complex systems with weak nonlinearities and local interactions.</p>

High parasite diversity accelerates host adaptation and diversification
<p>Host-parasite species pairs are known to coevolve, but how multiple parasites coevolve with their host is unclear. By using experimental coevolution of a host bacterium and its viral parasites, we revealed that diverse parasite communities accelerated host evolution and altered coevolutionary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics to enhance host resistance and decrease parasite infectivity. Increases in parasite diversity drove shifts in the mode of selection from fluctuating (Red Queen) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics to predominately directional (arms race) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Arms race <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics were characterized by selective sweeps of generalist resistance mutations in the genes for the host bacterium’s cell surface lipopolysaccharide (a bacteriophage receptor), which caused faster molecular evolution within host populations and greater genetic divergence among populations. These results indicate that exposure to multiple parasites influences the rate and type of host-parasite coevolution.</p>

Enzyme-free nucleic acid dynamical systems
<p>Chemistries exhibiting complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics—from inorganic oscillators to gene regulatory networks—have been long known but either cannot be reprogrammed at will or rely on the sophisticated enzyme chemistry underlying the central dogma. Can simpler molecular mechanisms, designed from scratch, exhibit the same range of behaviors? Abstract chemical reaction networks have been proposed as a programming language for complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, along with their systematic implementation using short synthetic DNA molecules. We developed this technology for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ical systems by identifying critical design principles and codifying them into a compiler automating the design process. Using this approach, we built an oscillator containing only DNA components, establishing that Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions alone suffice for complex chemical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics and that autonomous molecular systems can be designed via molecular programming languages.</p>

Acclimation to Fluctuating Light Impacts the Rapidity of Response and Diurnal Rhythm of Stomatal Conductance<sup><xref>1</xref></sup>
<p>Plant acclimation to growth light environment has been studied extensively; however, the majority of these studies have focused on light intensity and photo-acclimation, with few studies exploring the impact of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic growth light on stomatal acclimation and behavior. To assess the impact of growth light regime on stomatal acclimation, we grew Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in three different lighting regimes (with the same average daily intensity), fluctuating with a fixed pattern of light, fluctuating with a randomized pattern of light (sinusoidal), and nonfluctuating (square wave), to assess the effect of light regime <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics on gas exchange. We demonstrated that <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> (stomatal conductance to water vapor) acclimation is influenced by both intensity and light pattern, modifying the stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics at different times of the day and resulting in differences in the rapidity and magnitude of the <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response. We also describe and quantify the response to an internal signal that uncouples variation in <i>A</i> and <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> over the majority of the diurnal period and represents 25% of the total diurnal <i>g<sub>s</sub></i>. This <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> response can be characterized by a Gaussian element and when incorporated into the widely used Ball-Berry model greatly improved the prediction of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic environment. From these findings, we conclude that acclimation of <i>g<sub>s</sub></i> to growth light could be an important strategy for maintaining carbon fixation and overall plant water status and should be considered when inferring responses in the field from laboratory-based experiments.</p>

A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy
<p>Process-based crop growth models are popular tools with which to analyze and understand the impact of crop management, genotype-by-environment interactions, or climate change. The ability to predict leaf area development is critical to predict crop growth, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering growth coordination rules between wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant organs (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and sheaths, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to model the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of canopy development. We found a unique relationship between laminae area and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and sheath areas also were found, highlighting the tight control of organ growth within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to develop a simulation model of leaf area <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics at the canopy level that was integrated in the wheat model SiriusQuality. The model was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The model accurately predicts leaf area <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics under different scenarios of nitrogen and water limitations. It accounted for 85%, 64%, and 73% of the variability of the surface area of leaf cohorts, total leaf area index, and total green area index, respectively. The process-based model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of leaf area described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on wheat growth.</p>

Mechanical Failure of Fine Root Cortical Cells Initiates Plant Hydraulic Decline during Drought
<p>Root systems perform the crucial task of absorbing water from the soil to meet the demands of a transpiring canopy. Roots are thought to operate like electrical fuses, which break when carrying an excessive load under conditions of drought stress. Yet the exact site and sequence of this dysfunction in roots remain elusive. Using in vivo x-ray computed microtomography, we found that drought-induced mechanical failure (i.e. lacunae formation) in fine root cortical cells is the initial and primary driver of reduced fine root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity (Lp<sub>r</sub>) under mild to moderate drought stress. Cortical lacunae started forming under mild drought stress (−0.6 MPa Ψ<sub>stem</sub>), coincided with a dramatic reduction in Lp<sub>r</sub>, and preceded root shrinkage or significant xylem embolism. Only under increased drought stress was embolism formation observed in the root xylem, and it appeared first in the fine roots (50% loss of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductivity [P<sub>50</sub>] reached at −1.8 MPa) and then in older, coarse roots (P<sub>50</sub> = −3.5 MPa). These results suggest that cortical cells in fine roots function like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic fuses that decouple plants from drying soil, thus preserving the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic integrity of the plant’s vascular system under early stages of drought stress. Cortical lacunae formation led to permanent structural damage of the root cortex and nonrecoverable Lp<sub>r</sub>, pointing to a role in fine root mortality and turnover under drought stress.</p>

Factorial Effects of Evolocumab and Atorvastatin on Lipoprotein Metabolism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9), such as evolocumab, lower plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations. Evolocumab is under investigation for its effects on cardiovascular outcomes in statin-treated, high-risk patients. The mechanism of action of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies on lipoprotein metabolism remains to be fully evaluated.

The reduction in LDL-apoB and LDL-cholesterol concentrations was significantly greater with combination versus either monotherapy (<i>P</i><0.001). Whereas evolocumab but not atorvastatin lowered the concentration of free PCSK9, atorvastatin lowered the lathosterol/campesterol ratio (a measure of cholesterol synthesis/absorption) and apoC-III concentration.

Cell competition during reprogramming gives rise to dominant clones
<p>The ability to generate induced pluripotent stem cells from differentiated cell types has enabled researchers to engineer cell states. Although studies have identified molecular networks that reprogram cells to pluripotency, the cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of these processes remain poorly understood. Here, by combining cellular barcoding, mathematical modeling, and lineage tracing approaches, we demonstrate that reprogramming <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in heterogeneous populations are driven by dominant “elite” clones. Clones arise a priori from a population of poised mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from Wnt1-expressing cells that may represent a neural crest–derived population. This work highlights the importance of cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in fate programming outcomes and uncovers cell competition as a mechanism by which cells with eliteness emerge to occupy and dominate the reprogramming niche.</p>

Design and control of gas diffusion process in a nanoporous soft crystal

The PCP shows substantial temperature-responsive adsorption in which the adsorbate molecules are differentiated by each gate-admission temperature, facilitating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics-based gas separations of oxygen/argon and ethylene/ethane with high selectivities of ~350 and ~75, respectively.

Dynamic salience processing in paraventricular thalamus gates associative learning
<p>The salience of behaviorally relevant stimuli is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic and influenced by internal state and external environment. Monitoring such changes is critical for effective learning and flexible behavior, but the neuronal substrate for tracking the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of stimulus salience is obscure. We found that neurons in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) are robustly activated by a variety of behaviorally relevant events, including novel (“unfamiliar”) stimuli, reinforcing stimuli and their predicting cues, as well as omission of the expected reward. PVT responses are scaled with stimulus intensity and modulated by changes in homeostatic state or behavioral context. Inhibition of the PVT responses suppresses appetitive or aversive associative learning and reward extinction. Our findings demonstrate that the PVT gates associative learning by providing a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic representation of stimulus salience.</p>

Cancer mutations and targeted drugs can disrupt dynamic signal encoding by the Ras-Erk pathway
<p>The Ras-Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway encodes information in its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics; the duration and frequency of Erk activity can specify distinct cell fates. To enable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic encoding, temporal information must be accurately transmitted from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. We used optogenetic profiling to show that both oncogenic B-Raf mutations and B-Raf inhibitors can cause corruption of this transmission, so that short pulses of input Ras activity are distorted into abnormally long Erk outputs. These changes can reshape downstream transcription and cell fates, resulting in improper decisions to proliferate. These findings illustrate how altered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic signal transmission properties, and not just constitutively increased signaling, can contribute to cell proliferation and perhaps cancer, and how optogenetic profiling can dissect mechanisms of signaling dysfunction in disease.</p>

When minority groups reached the critical mass—that is, the critical group size for initiating social change—they were consistently able to overturn the established behavior.

Experimentally realized mechanochemistry distinct from force-accelerated scission of loaded bonds

The role of dimer asymmetry and protomer dynamics in enzyme catalysis
<p>Freeze-trapping x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and computational techniques reveal the distribution of states and their interconversion rates along the reaction pathway of a bacterial homodimeric enzyme, fluoroacetate dehalogenase (FAcD). The crystal structure of apo-FAcD exhibits asymmetry around the dimer interface and cap domain, priming one protomer for substrate binding. This asymmetry is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically averaged through conformational exchange on a millisecond time scale. During catalysis, the protomer conformational exchange rate becomes enhanced, the empty protomer exhibits increased local disorder, and water egresses. Computational studies identify allosteric pathways between protomers. Water release and enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics associated with catalysis compensate for entropic losses from substrate binding while facilitating sampling of the transition state.

The largest event [moment magnitude (<i>M</i><sub>W</sub>) 3.9] occurred several weeks after injection along a fault that appears to extend from the injection zone into crystalline basement.

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of wave packets. However, the rapidity of electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of electron wave packets in the time domain. Using spectrally resolved electron interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photoelectron wave packet created through a Fano autoionizing resonance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference wave packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant wave packet released in the continuum. In turn, this resolves the buildup of the autoionizing resonance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics governed by electron correlation, as well as coherent control over structured electron wave packets.</p>

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of many-body systems spanning condensed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase transitions. The universal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose condensates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives condensates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the condensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics.</p>

In condensed matter systems, the time scale for such “ultrafast” processes is typically set by the Fermi energy. Taking advantage of fast and precise control of interactions between ultracold atoms, we observed nonequilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of impurities coupled to an atomic Fermi sea. Our interferometric measurements track the nonperturbative quantum evolution of a fermionic many-body system, revealing in real time the formation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of quasi-particles and the quantum interference between attractive and repulsive states throughout the full depth of the Fermi sea. Ultrafast time-domain methods applied to strongly interacting quantum gases enable the study of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of quantum matter under extreme nonequilibrium conditions.</p>

Convergence Between Science and Environmental Education
<p>Urgent issues such as climate change, food scarcity, malnutrition, and loss of biodiversity are highly complex and contested in both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e and society (<i>1</i>). To address them, environmental educators and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e educators seek to engage people in what are commonly referred to as sustainability challenges. Regrettably, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">scienc</span></strong>e education (SE), which focuses primarily on teaching knowledge and skills, and environmental education (EE), which also stresses the incorporation of values and changing behaviors, have become increasingly distant. The relationship between SE and EE has been characterized as “distant, competitive, predatorprey and host-parasite” (<i>2</i>). We examine the potential for a convergence of EE and SE that might engage people in addressing fundamental socioecological challenges.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Hydrogen Sulfide Disturbs Actin Polymerization via <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration Resulting in Stunted Root Hair Growth
<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is an important signaling molecule in plants. Our previous report suggested that H<sub>2</sub>S signaling affects the actin cytoskeleton and root hair growth. However, the underlying mechanisms of its effects are not understood. <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration of proteins is regulated directly by H<sub>2</sub>S, which converts the thiol groups of cysteine (Cys) residues to persulfides and alters protein function. In this work, we studied the effects of <i>S</i>-sulfhydration on actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). We generated transgenic plants overexpressing the H<sub>2</sub>S biosynthesis-related genes <i><sc>l</sc>-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE</i> (<i>LCD</i>) and <i><sc>d</sc>-CYSTEINE DESULFHYDRASE</i> in the <i>O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase isoform a1</i> (<i>oasa1</i>) mutant and Columbia-0 backgrounds. The H<sub>2</sub>S content increased significantly in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. The density of filamentous actin (F-actin) bundles and the F-actin/globular actin ratio decreased in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. <i>S</i>-Sulfhydration also was enhanced in overexpressing <i>LCD</i>/<i>oasa1</i> plants. An analysis of actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics suggested that <i>S</i>-sulfhydration inhibited actin polymerization. We also found that ACTIN2 (ACT2) was <i>S</i>-sulfhydrated at Cys-287. Cys-287 is adjacent to the D-loop, which acts as a central region for hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and stabilizes F-actin filaments. Overaccumulation of H<sub>2</sub>S caused the depolymerization of F-actin bundles and inhibited root hair growth. Introduction of <i>ACT2</i> carrying a Cys-287-to-Ser mutation into an <i>act2-1</i> mutant partially suppressed H<sub>2</sub>S-dependent inhibition of root hair growth. We conclude that H<sub>2</sub>S regulates actin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics and affects root hair growth.</p>

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian oscillator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian oscillator period are thought to adjust the timing of biological activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian oscillator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of biological events. Our data provide insight into how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic period adjustment of circadian oscillators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

Chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> Fluxes into and across Thylakoids Revealed by Thylakoid-Targeted Aequorin Probes
<p>Chloroplasts require a fine-tuned control of their internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, which is crucial for many aspects of photosynthesis and for other chloroplast-localized processes. Increasing evidence suggests that calcium regulation within chloroplasts also may influence Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways in the cytosol. To investigate the involvement of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and in the modulation of chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in vivo, we targeted the bioluminescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter aequorin as a YFP fusion to the lumen and the stromal surface of thylakoids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Thylakoid localization of aequorin-based probes in stably transformed lines was confirmed by confocal microscopy, immunogold labeling, and biochemical analyses. In resting conditions in the dark, free Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the thylakoid lumen were maintained at about 0.5 μ<sc>m</sc>, which was a 3- to 5-fold higher concentration than in the stroma. Monitoring of chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in different intrachloroplast subcompartments (stroma, thylakoid membrane, and thylakoid lumen) revealed the occurrence of stimulus-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, characterized by unique <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ic parameters. Oxidative and salt stresses initiated pronounced free Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in the thylakoid lumen. Localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases also were observed on the thylakoid membrane surface, mirroring transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes observed for the bulk stroma, but with specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Moreover, evidence was obtained for dark-stimulated intrathylakoid Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes, suggesting a new scenario for light-to-dark-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes inside chloroplasts. Hence, thylakoid-targeted aequorin reporters can provide new insights into chloroplast Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage and signal transduction. These probes represent novel tools with which to investigate the role of thylakoids in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling networks within chloroplasts and plant cells.</p>

F-Actin Mediated Focusing of Vesicles at the Cell Tip Is Essential for Polarized Growth
<p>F-actin has been shown to be essential for tip growth in an array of plant models, including <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. One hypothesis is that diffusion can transport secretory vesicles, while actin plays a regulatory role during secretion. Alternatively, it is possible that actin-based transport is necessary to overcome vesicle transport limitations to sustain secretion. Therefore, a quantitative analysis of diffusion, secretion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics, and cell geometry is necessary to clarify the role of actin in polarized growth. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we first show that secretory vesicles move toward and accumulate at the tip in an actin-dependent manner. We then depolymerized F-actin to decouple vesicle diffusion from actin-mediated transport and measured the diffusion coefficient and concentration of vesicles. Using these values, we constructed a theoretical diffusion-based model for growth, demonstrating that with fast-enough vesicle fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics, diffusion could support normal cell growth rates. We further refined our model to explore how experimentally extrapolated vesicle fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">kinet</span></strong>ics and the size of the secretion zone limit diffusion-based growth. This model predicts that diffusion-mediated growth is dependent on the size of the region of exocytosis at the tip and that diffusion-based growth would be significantly slower than normal cell growth. To further explore the size of the secretion zone, we used a cell wall degradation enzyme cocktail and determined that the secretion zone is smaller than 6 μm in diameter at the tip. Taken together, our results highlight the requirement for active transport in polarized growth and provide important insight into vesicle secretion during tip growth.</p>

Conserved Dynamics of Chloroplast Cytoskeletal FtsZ Proteins Across Photosynthetic Lineages
<p>The cytoskeletal Filamenting temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) ring is critical for cell division in bacteria and chloroplast division in photosynthetic eukaryotes. While bacterial FtsZ rings are composed of a single FtsZ, except in the basal glaucophytes, chloroplast division involves two heteropolymer-forming FtsZ isoforms: FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 in the green lineage and FtsZA and FtsZB in red algae. FtsZ1 and FtsZB probably arose by duplication of the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively. We expressed fluorescent fusions of FtsZ from diverse photosynthetic organisms in a heterologous system to compare their intrinsic assembly and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic properties. FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments were morphologically distinct from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments. When coexpressed, FtsZ pairs from plants and algae colocalized, consistent with heteropolymerization. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that subunit exchange was greater from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments than from FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments and that FtsZ1 and FtsZB increased turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively, from heteropolymers. GTPase activity was essential only for turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments. Cyanobacterial and glaucophyte FtsZ properties mostly resembled those of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, though the glaucophyte protein exhibited some hybrid features. Our results demonstrate that the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA have retained functional attributes of their common FtsZ ancestor, while eukaryotic-specific FtsZ1 and FtsZB acquired new but similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic properties, possibly through convergent evolution. Our findings suggest that the evolution of a second FtsZ that could copolymerize with the more ancestral form to enhance FtsZ-ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics may have been essential for plastid evolution in the green and red photosynthetic lineages.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf isotopic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics, gas exchange, water use, and isotope physiology.</p>

Dynamic Interplay between Nucleoid Segregation and Genome Integrity in <i>Chlamydomonas</i> Chloroplasts
<p>The chloroplast (cp) genome is organized as nucleoids that are dispersed throughout the cp stroma. Previously, a cp homolog of bacterial recombinase RecA (cpRECA) was shown to be involved in the maintenance of cp genome integrity by repairing damaged chloroplast DNA and by suppressing aberrant recombination between short dispersed repeats in the moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i>. Here, overexpression and knockdown analysis of cpRECA in the green alga <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> revealed that cpRECA was involved in cp nucleoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics as well as having a role in maintaining cp genome integrity. Overexpression of <i>cpRECA</i> tagged with yellow fluorescent protein or hemagglutinin resulted in the formation of giant filamentous structures that colocalized exclusively to chloroplast DNA and cpRECA localized to cp nucleoids in a heterogenous manner. Knockdown of <i>cpRECA</i> led to a significant reduction in cp nucleoid number that was accompanied by nucleoid enlargement. This phenotype resembled those of gyrase inhibitor-treated cells and <i>monokaryotic chloroplast</i> mutant cells and suggested that cpRECA was involved in organizing cp nucleoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. The cp genome also was destabilized by induced recombination between short dispersed repeats in <i>cpRECA-</i>knockdown cells and gyrase inhibitor-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that cpRECA and gyrase are both involved in nucleoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics and the maintenance of genome integrity and that the mechanisms underlying these processes may be intimately related in <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cps.</p>

Apparent Overinvestment in Leaf Venation Relaxes Leaf Morphological Constraints on Photosynthesis in Arid Habitats
<p>Leaf veins supply the mesophyll with water that evaporates when stomata are open to allow CO<sub>2</sub> uptake for photosynthesis. Theoretical analyses suggest that water is optimally distributed in the mesophyll when the lateral distance between veins (<i>d</i><sub>x</sub>) is equal to the distance from these veins to the epidermis (<i>d</i><sub>y</sub>), expressed as <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ≈ 1. Although this theory is supported by observations of many derived angiosperms, we hypothesize that plants in arid environments may reduce <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> below unity owing to climate-specific functional adaptations of increased leaf thickness and increased vein density. To test our hypothesis, we assembled leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic, morphological, and photosynthetic traits of 68 species from the <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Corymbia</i> genera (termed eucalypts) along an aridity gradient in southwestern Australia. We inferred the potential gas-exchange advantage of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> using a model that links leaf morphology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ics to photosynthesis. Our observations reveal that eucalypts in arid environments have thick amphistomatous leaves with high vein densities, resulting in <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> ratios that range from 1.6 to 0.15 along the aridity gradient. Our model suggests that, as leaves become thicker, the effect of reducing <i>d</i><sub>x</sub> beyond <i>d</i><sub>y</sub> is to offset the reduction in leaf gas exchange that would result from maintaining <i>d</i><sub>x</sub>:<i>d</i><sub>y</sub> at unity. This apparent overinvestment in leaf venation may be explained from the selective pressure of aridity, under which traits associated with long leaf life span, high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">hydraul</span></strong>ic and thermal capacitances, and high potential rates of leaf water transport confer a competitive advantage.</p>

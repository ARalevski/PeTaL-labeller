Reproduction-related variation in carbon allocation to woody tissues in <i>Fagus crenata</i> using a natural <sup>13</sup>C approach
<p>The contribution of new photo-assimilates and stored carbon (C) to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth remains poorly understood, especially during reproduction. In order to elucidate how mast seeding affects C allocation to both reproductive and vegetative tissues, we measured biomass increase in each tissue, branch starch concentration and stable C isotope composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C) in bulk leaves, current-year shoots, 3-year branches and tree rings in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing and non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing trees for 2 years, as well as in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s. We isolated the effect of reproduction on C allocation to vegetative growth by comparing <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in woody tissues in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing and non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing specimens. Compared with 2‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in shoots relative to leaves from non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing trees, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing reduced the enrichment to 1‰ and this reduction disappeared in the following year with no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing, indicating that new photo-assimilates are preferentially used for woody tissues even with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing burden. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s had up to 2.5‰ <sup>13</sup>C enrichment at mid-summer, which dropped thereafter, indicating that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> production relies on C storage early in the growing season then shifts to current photo-assimilates. At this tipping point, growth of shoots and cupules had almost finished and nuts had a second rapid growth period thereafter. Together with shorter shoots but higher biomass increment per length in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing trees than non-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing trees, these results indicate that the C limitation due to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> burden is minimized by fine-tuning of allocation of old C stores and new photo-assimilates, along with the growth pattern in various tissues. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>ing had no significant effect on starch concentration in 3-year-old branches, which became fully depleted during leaf and flower flushing but were quickly replenished. These results indicate that reproduction affects C allocation to branches but not its source or storage. These reproduction-related variations in the fate of C have implications for evaluating forest ecosystem C cycles during climate change.</p>

Aphid-borne Viral Spread Is Enhanced by Virus-induced Accumulation of Plant Reactive Oxygen Species
<p>Most known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> viruses are spread from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> by insect vectors. There is strong evidence that nonpersistently transmitted viruses manipulate the release of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> volatiles to attract insect vectors, thereby promoting virus spread. The mechanisms whereby aphid settling and feeding is altered on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected with these viruses, however, are unclear. Here we employed loss-of-function mutations in cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and one of its host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>), to elucidate such mechanisms. We show that, relative to a CMVΔ2b strain with a deletion of the viral suppressor of RNAi 2b protein in CMV, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected with wild-type CMV produce higher concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues. Aphids on wild-type CMV-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s engage in shorter probes, less phloem feeding, and exhibit other changes, as detected by electrical penetration graphing technology, relative to CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Therefore, the frequency of virus acquisition and the virus load per aphid were greater on CMV-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s than on CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Aphids also moved away from initial feeding sites more frequently on wild-type CMV infected versus CMVΔ2b-infected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The role of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in eliciting these effects on aphids was corroborated using healthy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infused with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Finally, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels were not elevated, and aphid behavior was unchanged, on CMV-infected RbohD-silenced tobacco <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which are deficient in the induction of ROS production. These results suggest that CMV uses its viral suppressor of RNAi protein to increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> ROS levels, thereby enhancing its acquisition and transmission by vector insects.</p>

Gall induction may benefit host plant: a case of a gall wasp and eucalyptus tree
<p>Gall-inducing insects display intimate interactions with their host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, usually described as parasitic relationships; the galls seem to favor the galler alone. We report on a case in which the presence of the galls induced by <i>Leptocybe invasa</i> Fisher & LaSalle (Hymenoptera; Eulophidae) benefit its host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, the river red gum <i>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</i> Dehnh. Field observations showed that <i>E. camaldulensis</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s infected by this gall wasp were less susceptible to cold injury than neighboring conspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s without galls. In the laboratory, frost resistance was compared between galled and non-galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s which were both divided into two subgroups: cold-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s that were non-acclimated. Galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed higher frost resistance than the non-galled ones, and the differences were higher in non-acclimated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with acclimated ones. Physiological changes in host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> were determined by chemical analyses of chlorophylls, proteins, soluble sugars and anthocyanin contents. The results showed higher values of all physiological parameters in the galled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of the gall wasp induces physiological changes on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> foliage, which may in turn increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense mechanisms against cold. Therefore, the toll of galling by the herbivore may pay off by the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> acquiring increased frost resistance. This work provides evidence for physiological changes induced by a herbivore which might have a positive indirect effect on the host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, promoting frost resistance such as cold acclimation.</p>

Giberellic Acid-Stimulated Transcript Proteins Evolved through Successive Conjugation of Novel Motifs and Their Subfunctionalization
<p><i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript</i> (<i>GAST</i>)-like genes encode small polypeptides, some of which have been implicated in diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes regulating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development. However, the occurrence of GASTs among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, their protein structures, and the mechanisms by which they evolved remain elusive. Here, using a customized workflow, we report genes encoding GAST proteins, identify novel motifs and evolutionary patterns contributing to the subfunctionalization of GAST domains, and explore functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation across diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> groups. We show that <i>GAST</i>-like sequences evolved initially in the vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> <i>Selaginella moellendorffii</i>, after the divergence from bryophytes, and later emerged in gymnosperms and angiosperms. GASTs in angiosperms are characterized by four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed novel motifs; however, relatively fewer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed motifs exist in pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the GAST-Cysteine Rich1 motif evolved early in the <i>S. moellendorffii</i> GAST, which further acquired subfunctionalization through successive conjugation of other motifs and remained <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed across <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, as supported by their collinearity. Functional characterization of two orthologs from the dicot Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated Arabidopsis 10</i>) and the monocot rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>; <i>Gibberellic Acid Stimulated Transcript-Related 9</i>) suggests hormonal regulation, novel roles in seed germination, and functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation among diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> groups. Computational modeling predicts that these <i>GAST</i> genes are regulated by several factors, including the phytohormones gibberellin and abscisic acid, through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed cis-motifs present in their promoters, and that they might act as signaling molecules in a complex feedback loop. Thus, our study identifies <i>GAST</i>s and their encoded proteins, uncovers their structure, novel motifs, and evolutionary pattern among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, and suggests their functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ation.</p>

The <i>RIN-MC</i> Fusion of MADS-Box Transcription Factors Has Transcriptional Activity and Modulates Expression of Many Ripening Genes
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> development and ripening is regulated by genetic and environmental factors and is of critical importance for seed dispersal, reproduction, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> quality. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <i>ripening inhibitor</i> (<i>rin</i>) mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> have a classic ripening-inhibited phenotype, which is attributed to a genomic DNA deletion resulting in the fusion of two truncated transcription factors, <i>RIN</i> and <i>MC</i>. In wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>, RIN, a MADS-box transcription factor, is a key regulator of the ripening gene expression network, with hundreds of gene targets controlling changes in color, flavor, texture, and taste during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening; <i>MC</i>, on the other hand, has low expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>, and the potential functions of the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene in ripening remain unclear. Here, overexpression of <i>RIN-MC</i> in transgenic wild-type cv Ailsa Craig <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s impaired several ripening processes, and down-regulating <i>RIN-MC</i> expression in the <i>rin</i> mutant was found to stimulate the normal yellow mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> to produce a weak red color, suggesting a distinct negative role for <i>RIN-MC</i> in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening. By comparative transcriptome analysis of <i>rin</i> and <i>rin 35S</i>::<i>RIN-MC</i> RNA interference <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s, a total of 1,168 and 1,234 genes were identified as potential targets of RIN-MC activation and inhibition. Furthermore, the <i>RIN-MC</i> fusion gene was shown to be translated into a chimeric transcription factor that was localized to the nucleus and was capable of protein interactions with other MADS-box factors. These results indicated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> RIN-MC fusion plays a negative role in ripening and encodes a chimeric transcription factor that modulates the expression of many ripening genes, thereby contributing to the <i>rin</i> mutant phenotype.</p>

The Wheat <i>Lr67</i> Gene from the Sugar Transport Protein 13 Family Confers Multipathogen Resistance in Barley
<p>Fungal pathogens are a major constraint to global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> production; hence, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> genes encoding pathogen resistance are important tools for combating disease. A few resistance genes identified to date provide partial, durable resistance to multiple pathogens and the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and resistant alleles – G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in yeast as a high affinity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by ∼ 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in yeast was reduced when coexpressed with <i>Lr67res</i>. Stable transgenic <i>Lr67res</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> lines exhibited seedling resistance to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>-specific pathogens <i>Puccinia hordei</i> and <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>, which cause leaf rust and powdery mildew, respectively. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s expressing <i>Lr67res</i> exhibited early senescence and higher pathogenesis-related (<i>PR</i>) gene expression. Unlike previous observations implicating flavonoids in the resistance of transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sorghum</span></strong> (<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sorghum</span></strong> bicolor</i>) expressing <i>Lr34res</i>, another wheat multipathogen resistance gene, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> flavonoids are unlikely to have a role in Lr67res-mediated resistance. Similar to observations made in yeast, Lr67res reduced Glc uptake <i>in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>a</i>. These results confirm that the pathway by which <i>Lr67res</i> confers resistance to fungal pathogens is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ed between wheat and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s could potentially increase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental pollution. Within most <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> N use efficiency. The modified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s and seeds as control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been designed and deployed for short-stature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sorghum</span></strong> (<i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sorghum</span></strong> bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sorghum</span></strong> lines were reconstructed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional reconstruction; (2) Automatic Hedge-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D reconstruction; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related architectural trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture parameters of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sorghum</span></strong>, a tall and densely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>ed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> species.</p>

Plant-soil feedback and the maintenance of diversity in Mediterranean-climate shrublands
<p>Soil biota influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-soil feedback, but it is unclear whether the strength of such feedback depends on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> traits and whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-soil feedback drives local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> diversity. We grew 16 co-occurring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> species with contrasting nutrient-acquisition strategies from hyperdiverse Australian shrublands and exposed them to soil biota from under their own or other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> species. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses to soil biota varied according to their nutrient-acquisition strategy, including positive feedback for ectomycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and negative feedback for nitrogen-fixing and nonmycorrhizal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Simulations revealed that such strategy-dependent feedback is sufficient to maintain the high taxonomic and functional diversity characterizing these Mediterranean-climate shrublands. Our study identifies nutrient-acquisition strategy as a key trait explaining how different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> responses to soil biota promote local <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> diversity.</p>

The NAC Transcription Factor SlNAP2 Regulates Leaf Senescence and Fruit Yield in Tomato
<p>Leaf senescence is an essential physiological process in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s that supports the recycling of nitrogen and other nutrients to support the growth of developing organs, including young leaves, seeds, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s. Thus, the regulation of senescence is crucial for evolutionary success in wild populations and for increasing yield in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s. Here, we describe the influence of a NAC transcription factor, SlNAP2 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> NAC-like, activated by Apetala3/Pistillata), that controls both leaf senescence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> yield in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>S. lycopersicum</i>). <i>SlNAP2</i> expression increases during age-dependent and dark-induced leaf senescence. We demonstrate that SlNAP2 activates <i>SlSAG113</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENE113</i>), a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>SAG113</i>, chlorophyll degradation genes such as <i>SlSGR1</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum</i> senescence-inducible chloroplast stay-green protein 1) and <i>SlPAO</i> (<i>S. lycopersicum</i> pheide <i>a</i> oxygenase), and other downstream targets by directly binding to their promoters, thereby promoting leaf senescence. Furthermore, SlNAP2 directly controls the expression of genes important for abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 1 (<i>SlNCED1</i>); transport, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> ABC transporter G family member 40 (<i>SlABCG40</i>); and degradation, <i>S. lycopersicum</i> ABA 8′-hydroxylase (<i>SlCYP707A2</i>), indicating that SlNAP2 has a complex role in establishing ABA homeostasis during leaf senescence. Inhibiting <i>SlNAP2</i> expression in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s impedes leaf senescence but enhances <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> yield and sugar content likely due to prolonged leaf photosynthesis in aging <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Our data indicate that SlNAP2 has a central role in controlling leaf senescence and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> yield in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>.</p>

Importance of Fluctuations in Light on Plant Photosynthetic Acclimation
<p>The acclimation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to light has been studied extensively, yet little is known about the effect of dynamic fluctuations in light on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phenotype and acclimatory responses. We mimicked natural fluctuations in light over a diurnal period to examine the effect on the photosynthetic processes and growth of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). High and low light intensities, delivered via a realistic dynamic fluctuating or square wave pattern, were used to grow and assess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s subjected to square wave light had thicker leaves and greater photosynthetic capacity compared with fluctuating light-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. This, together with elevated levels of proteins associated with electron transport, indicates greater investment in leaf structural components and photosynthetic processes. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating light had thinner leaves, lower leaf light absorption, but maintained similar photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area to square wave-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Despite high light use efficiency, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating light had a slow growth rate early in development, likely due to the fact that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s grown under fluctuating conditions were not able to fully utilize the light energy absorbed for carbon fixation. Diurnal leaf-level measurements revealed a negative feedback control of photosynthesis, resulting in a decrease in total diurnal carbon assimilated of at least 20%. These findings highlight that growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under square wave growth conditions ultimately fails to predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> performance under realistic light regimes and stress the importance of considering fluctuations in incident light in future experiments that aim to infer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> productivity under natural conditions in the field.</p>

Isoscapes resolve species-specific spatial patterns in plant–plant interactions in an invaded Mediterranean dune ecosystem
<p>Environmental heterogeneity and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions are key factors shaping <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> communities. However, the spatial dimension of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions has seldom been addressed in field studies. This is at least partially rooted in a lack of methods that can accurately resolve functional processes in a spatially explicit manner. Isoscapes, that is, spatially explicit representations of stable isotope data, provide a versatile means to trace functional changes on spatial scales, for example, related to N-cycling (foliar δ<sup>15</sup>N) and water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub>, foliar δ<sup>13</sup>C). In a case study in a nutrient-depleted Mediterranean dune ecosystem, we analysed the spatial impact of the invasive N<sub>2</sub>-fixing <i>Acacia longifolia</i> on three native species of different functional types using δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Isoscapes revealed strong spatial patterns in δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C with pronounced species-specific differences, demonstrating distinct spatial ranges of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> interactions. A coniferous tree and an ericaceous dwarf shrub showed significant enrichment in δ<sup>15</sup>N within a range of 5–8 m surrounding the canopy of <i>A. longifolia</i>, indicating input of N originating from symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation by the invader. In the dwarf shrub, which was most responsive to invader influence, enrichment in δ<sup>13</sup>C additionally demonstrated spatially explicit changes to WUE<sub>i</sub>, while a native N<sub>2</sub>-fixer was unresponsive to the presence of the invader.

The Potassium Transporter SlHAK10 Is Involved in Mycorrhizal Potassium Uptake
<p>Most terrestrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s form a root symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which receive fixed carbon from the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> and enhance the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>’s uptake of mineral nutrients. AM symbiosis improves the phosphorous and nitrogen nutrition of host <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s; however, little is known about the role of AM symbiosis in potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) nutrition. Here, we report that inoculation with the AM fungus <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and K<sup>+</sup> acquisition and that K<sup>+</sup> deficiency has a negative effect on root growth and AM colonization. Based on its homology to a <i>Lotus japonicus</i> AM-induced K<sup>+</sup> transporter, we identified a mycorrhiza-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> K<sup>+</sup> transporter, SlHAK10 (<i>Solanum lycopersicum High-affinity Potassium Transporter10</i>), that was exclusively expressed in arbuscule-containing cells. <i>SlHAK10</i> could restore a yeast K<sup>+</sup> uptake-defective mutant in the low-affinity concentration range. Loss of function of <i>SlHAK10</i> led to a significant decrease in mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake and AM colonization rate under low-K<sup>+</sup> conditions but did not affect arbuscule development. Overexpressing <i>SlHAK10</i> from the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the AM-specific <i>Solanum melongena Phosphate Transporter4</i> not only improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and K<sup>+</sup> uptake but also increased AM colonization efficiency and soluble sugar content in roots supplied with low K<sup>+</sup>. Our results indicate that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have a SlHAK10<i>-</i>mediated mycorrhizal K<sup>+</sup> uptake pathway and that improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> K<sup>+</sup> nutrition could increase carbohydrate accumulation in roots, which facilitates AM fungal colonization.</p>

Enhancer-Promoter Interaction of <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> Shapes Photoperiod Adaptation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a major vegetable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> grown and consumed worldwide. Modern cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>es are derived from their wild relative, <i>Solanum pimpinellifolium</i>, a short-day <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> that originated from the Andean region of South America. The molecular underpinnings of the regional adaptation and expansion of domesticated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> remain largely unclear. In this study, we examined flowering time in wild and cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>es under both long-day and short-day conditions. Using quantitative trait locus mapping in a recombinant inbred line population, we identified <i>SELF PRUNING 5G</i> (<i>SP5G</i>) as a major locus influencing daylength adaptation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>. Genetic diversity analysis revealed that the genomic region harboring <i>SP5G</i> shows signatures of a domestication sweep. We found that a 52-bp sequence within the 3′ untranslated region of <i>SP5G</i> is essential for the enhanced expression of this gene, leading to delayed flowering time in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>es through a promoter-enhancer interaction that occurs only under long-day conditions. We further demonstrate that the absence of the 52-bp sequence attenuates the promoter-enhancer interaction and reduces <i>SP5G</i> expression in cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>es, making their flowering time insensitive to daylength. Our findings demonstrate that cis-regulatory variation at the enhancer region of the <i>SP5G</i> 3′ untranslated region confers reduced photoperiodic response in cultivated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>es, uncovering a regulatory mechanism that could potentially be used to manipulate flowering time in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> through novel biotechnological approaches.</p>

The Tomato Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase SlMPK1 Is as a Negative Regulator of the High-Temperature Stress Response
<p>High-temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development. MAPK cascades play key roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and stress signaling, but their involvement in the HT stress response is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 47-kD MBP-phosphorylated protein (p47-MBPK) activated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves under HT and identify it as SlMPK1 by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of <i>SlMPK1</i> in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s resulted in enhanced tolerance to HT, while overexpression resulted in reduced tolerance. Proteomic analysis identified a set of proteins involved in antioxidant defense that are significantly more abundant in RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s than nontransgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under HT stress. RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also showed changes in membrane lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified a serine-proline-rich protein homolog, SlSPRH1, which interacts with SlMPK1 in yeast, in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> cells, and in vitro. We demonstrate that SlMPK1 can directly phosphorylate SlSPRH1. Furthermore, the serine residue serine-44 of SlSPRH1 is a crucial phosphorylation site in the SlMPK1-mediated antioxidant defense mechanism activated during HT stress. We also demonstrate that heterologous expression of <i>SlSPRH1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) led to a decrease in thermotolerance and lower antioxidant capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that SlMPK1 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. SlMPK1 acts by regulating antioxidant defense, and its substrate SlSPRH1 is involved in this pathway.</p>

The RNA Editing Factor SlORRM4 Is Required for Normal Fruit Ripening in Tomato
<p>RNA editing plays a key posttranscriptional role in gene expression. Existing studies on cytidine-to-uridine RNA editing in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have focused on maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, the importance and regulation of RNA editing in several critical agronomic processes are not well understood, a notable example of which is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening. Here, we analyzed the expression profile of 33 RNA editing factors and identified 11 putative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening-related factors. A rapid virus-induced gene silencing assay indicated that the organelle RNA recognition motif-containing protein SlORRM4 affected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening. Knocking out SlORRM4 expression using a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome editing strategy delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening by lowering respiratory rate and ethylene production. Additionally, the expression of numerous genes associated with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening and mitochondrial functions changed significantly when <i>SlORRM4</i> was knocked out. Moreover, the loss of <i>SlORRM4</i> function significantly reduced RNA editing of many mitochondrial transcripts, leading to low-level expression of some core subunits that are critical for mitochondrial complex assembly (i.e. Nad3, Cytc1, and COX II). Taken together, these results indicate that SlORRM4 is involved in RNA editing of transcripts in ripening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> that influence mitochondrial function and key aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening.</p>

<i>Trichoderma</i> Histone Deacetylase HDA-2 Modulates Multiple Responses in Arabidopsis
<p><i>Trichoderma</i> spp. are a rich source of secondary metabolites and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which may induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses and modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth. In filamentous fungi, chromatin modifications regulate secondary metabolism. In this study we investigated how the absence of histone deacetylase HDA-2 in the <i>Trichoderma atroviride</i> strain Δ<i>hda-2</i> impacts its effect on a host, Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The production of VOCs and their impact on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and development were assessed as well. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> strain was impaired in its ability to colonize Arabidopsis roots, thus affecting the promotion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and modulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses against foliar pathogens <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, which normally result from interaction with <i>T. atroviride</i>. Furthermore, Δ<i>hda-2</i> VOCs were incapable of triggering <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defenses to counterattack foliar pathogens. The Δ<i>hda-2</i> overproduced the VOC 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP), which resulted in enhanced root branching and differentially regulated phytohormone-related genes. Analysis of ten VOCs (including 6-PP) revealed that three of them positively regulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, whereas six had the opposite effect. Assessment of secondary metabolites, detoxification, and communication with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-related genes showed a dual role for HDA-2 in <i>T. atroviride</i> gene expression regulation during its interaction with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 on the promoters of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-responsive genes in Δ<i>hda-2</i> showed, in the presence of Arabidopsis, low levels of <i>epl-1</i> and <i>abc-2</i> compared with that in the wild type; whereas <i>ctf-1</i> presented high constitutive levels, supporting a dual role of HDA-2 in gene regulation. This work highlights the importance of HDA-2 as a global regulator in <i>Trichoderma</i> to modulate multiple responses in Arabidopsis.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s integrate these environmental cues to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a gibberellin-inactivation enzyme, namely <i>GIBBERELLIN2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic enzyme, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/gibberellin ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s integrate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have evolved for growth and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

BZR1 Mediates Brassinosteroid-Induced Autophagy and Nitrogen Starvation in Tomato
<p>Autophagy, an innate cellular destructive mechanism, plays crucial roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> development and responses to stress. Autophagy is known to be stimulated or suppressed by multiple molecular processes, but the role of phytohormone signaling in autophagy is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the transcripts of autophagy-related genes (<i>ATGs</i>) and the formation of autophagosomes are triggered by enhanced levels of brassinosteroid (BR). Furthermore, the BR-activated transcription factor brassinazole-resistant1 (BZR1), a positive regulator of the BR signaling pathway, is involved in BR-induced autophagy. Treatment with BR enhanced the formation of autophagosomes and the transcripts of <i>ATGs</i> in <i>BZR1</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, while the effects of BR were compromised in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Yeast one-hybrid analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that BZR1 bound to the promoters of <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG6</i>. The BR-induced formation of autophagosomes decreased in <i>ATG2</i>- and <i>ATG6</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Moreover, exogenous application of BR enhanced chlorophyll content and autophagosome formation and decreased the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins under nitrogen starvation. Leaf chlorosis and chlorophyll degradation were exacerbated in <i>BZR1</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and the BR biosynthetic mutant <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> but were alleviated in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under nitrogen starvation. Meanwhile, nitrogen starvation-induced expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation were compromised in both <i>BZR1</i>-silenced and <i>d<sup>^im</sup></i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s but were increased in <i>BZR1</i>- and <i>BZR1-1D</i>-overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Taken together, our results suggest that BZR1-dependent BR signaling up-regulates the expression of <i>ATGs</i> and autophagosome formation, which plays a critical role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> response to nitrogen starvation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>).</p>

Plant Phenotyping: An Active Vision Cell for Three-Dimensional Plant Shoot Reconstruction
<p>Three-dimensional (3D) computer-generated models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are urgently needed to support both phenotyping and simulation-based studies such as photosynthesis modeling. However, the construction of accurate 3D <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> models is challenging, as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are complex objects with an intricate leaf structure, often consisting of thin and highly reflective surfaces that vary in shape and size, forming dense, complex, crowded scenes. We address these issues within an image-based method by taking an active vision approach, one that investigates the scene to intelligently capture images, to image acquisition. Rather than use the same camera positions for all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, our technique is to acquire the images needed to reconstruct the target <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>, tuning camera placement to match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>’s individual structure. Our method also combines volumetric- and surface-based reconstruction methods and determines the necessary images based on the analysis of voxel clusters. We describe a fully automatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> modeling/phenotyping cell (or module) comprising a six-axis robot and a high-precision turntable. By using a standard color camera, we overcome the difficulties associated with laser-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> reconstruction methods. The 3D models produced are compared with those obtained from fixed cameras and evaluated by comparison with data obtained by x-ray microcomputed tomography across different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> structures. Our results show that our method is successful in improving the accuracy and quality of data obtained from a variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> types.</p>

Identification of a Hexenal Reductase That Modulates the Composition of Green Leaf Volatiles
<p>Green leaf volatiles (GLVs), including six-carbon (C6) aldehydes, alcohols, and esters, are formed when <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> tissues are damaged. GLVs play roles in direct <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense at wound sites, indirect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense via the attraction of herbivore predators, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> communication. GLV components provoke distinctive responses in their target recipients; therefore, the control of GLV composition is important for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to appropriately manage stress responses. The reduction of C6-aldehydes into C6-alcohols is a key step in the control of GLV composition and also is important to avoid a toxic buildup of C6-aldehydes. However, the molecular mechanisms behind C6-aldehyde reduction remain poorly understood. In this study, we purified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) NADPH-dependent cinnamaldehyde and hexenal reductase encoded by At4g37980, named here CINNAMALDEHYDE AND HEXENAL REDUCTASE (CHR). <i>CHR</i> T-DNA knockout mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed a normal growth phenotype; however, we observed significant suppression of C6-alcohol production following partial mechanical wounding or herbivore infestation. Our data also showed that the parasitic wasp <i>Cotesia vestalis</i> was more attracted to GLVs emitted from herbivore-infested wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s compared with GLVs emitted from <i>chr</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which corresponded with reduced C6-alcohol levels in the mutant. Moreover, <i>chr</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were more susceptible to exogenous high-dose exposure to (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexenal, as indicated by their markedly lowered photosystem II activity. Our study shows that reductases play significant roles in changing GLV composition and, thus, are important in avoiding toxicity from volatile carbonyls and in the attraction of herbivore predators.</p>

MicroRNA166 Modulates Cadmium Tolerance and Accumulation in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20- to 24-nucleotide small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> miRNAs, such as miR166, have vital roles in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, development and responses to environmental stresses. One such environmental stress encountered by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s is exposure to cadmium (Cd), an element highly toxic to most organisms, including humans and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In this study, we analyzed the role of miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). The expression levels of miR166 in both root and leaf tissues were significantly higher in the reproductive stage than in the seedling stage in rice. The expression of miR166 in the roots of rice seedlings was reduced after Cd treatment. Overexpression of miR166 in rice improved Cd tolerance, a result associated with the reduction of Cd-induced oxidative stress in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Furthermore, overexpression of miR166 reduced both Cd translocation from roots to shoots and Cd accumulation in the grains. miR166 targets genes encoding the class-III homeodomain-Leu zipper (HD-Zip) family proteins in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. In rice, <i>HOMEODOMAIN CONTAINING PROTEIN4</i> (<i>OsHB4</i>) gene (Os03g43930), which encodes an HD-Zip protein, was up-regulated by Cd treatment but down-regulated by overexpression of miR166 in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Overexpression of <i>OsHB4</i> increased Cd sensitivity and Cd accumulation in the leaves and grains of transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. By contrast, silencing <i>OsHB4</i> by RNA interference enhanced Cd tolerance in transgenic rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. These results indicate a critical role for miR166 in Cd accumulation and tolerance through regulation of its target gene, <i>OsHB4</i>, in rice.</p>

Transcription Factor-Mediated Control of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Vegetative Tissues
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s accumulate secondary metabolites to adapt to environmental conditions.

Producing compounds is often part of a more broad response of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> to changes in the environment. Here we investigate how a transcription-factor-mediated program for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis also has effects on formation of specialized cell structures and changes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> root architecture. A systems <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y approach was developed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) for coordinated induction of biosynthesis of anthocyanins, in a tissue- and development-independent manner. A transcription factor couple from <i>Antirrhinum</i> that is known to control anthocyanin biosynthesis was introduced in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> under control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. By application of dexamethasone, anthocyanin formation was induced within 24 h in vegetative tissues and in undifferentiated cells. Profiles of metabolites and gene expression were analyzed in several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> tissues. Changes in concentration of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds were observed in all tested tissues, accompanied by induction of the biosynthetic pathways leading from Glc to anthocyanins. A number of pathways that are not known to be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were observed to be regulated. Anthocyanin-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed profound physiological and architectural changes, depending on the tissue, including root branching, root epithelial cell morphology, seed germination, and leaf conductance. The inducible anthocyanin-production system reveals a range of phenomena that accompanies anthocyanin biosynthesis in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>, including adaptions of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s architecture and physiology.</p>

Correlations between Circadian Rhythms and Growth in Challenging Environments
<p>In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, the circadian system controls a plethora of processes, many with agronomic importance, such as photosynthesis, photoprotection, stomatal opening, and photoperiodic development, as well as molecular processes, such as gene expression. It has been suggested that modifying circadian rhythms may be a means to manipulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s to develop improved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s for agriculture. However, there is very little information on how the clock influences the performance of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. We used a noninvasive, high-throughput technique, based on prompt chlorophyll fluorescence, to measure circadian rhythms and demonstrated that the technique works in a range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Using fluorescence, we analyzed circadian rhythms in populations of wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i> ssp. <i>spontaneum</i>) from widely different ecogeographical locations in the Southern Levant part of the Fertile Crescent, an area with a high proportion of the total genetic variation of wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong>. Our results show that there is variability for circadian traits in the wild <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> lines. We observed that circadian period lengths were correlated with temperature and aspect at the sites of origin of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, while the amplitudes of the rhythms were correlated with soil composition. Thus, different environmental parameters may exert selection on circadian rhythms.</p>

A Tomato Vacuolar Invertase Inhibitor Mediates Sucrose Metabolism and Influences Fruit Ripening
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening is a complex process that involves a series of physiological and biochemical changes that ultimately influence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> quality traits, such as color and flavor. Sugar metabolism is an important factor in ripening, and there is evidence that it influences various aspects of ripening, although the associated mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we identified and analyzed the expression of 36 genes involved in Suc metabolism in ripening <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel mobility shift assays indicated that <i>SlVIF</i>, which encodes a vacuolar invertase inhibitor, and <i>SlVI</i>, encoding a vacuolar invertase, are directly regulated by the global <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening regulator RIPENING INHIBITOR (RIN). Moreover, we showed that SlVIF physically interacts with SlVI to control Suc metabolism. Repression of <i>SlVIF</i> by RNA interference delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening, while overexpression of <i>SlVIF</i> accelerated ripening, with concomitant changes in lycopene production and ethylene biosynthesis.

These findings provide evidence for the role of Suc in promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> ripening and establish that <i>SlVIF</i> contributes to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> quality and the RIN-mediated ripening regulatory mechanisms, which are of significant agricultural value.</p>

SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 Aides in Resilience to Salt and Drought in Freezing-Sensitive Tomato
<p>SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2 (SFR2) is crucial for protecting chloroplast membranes following freezing in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). It has been shown that SFR2 homologs are present in all land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, including freezing-sensitive species, raising the question of SFR2 function beyond freezing tolerance. Similar to freezing, salt and drought can cause dehydration. Thus, it is hypothesized that in freezing-sensitive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s SFR2 may play roles in their resilience to salt or drought. To test this hypothesis, <i>SlSFR2</i> RNAi lines were generated in the cold/freezing-sensitive species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> [M82 <i>cv</i>]). Hypersensitivity to salt and drought of <i>SlSFR2</i>-RNAi lines was observed. Higher tolerance of wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>es was correlated with the production of trigalactosyldiacylglycerol, a product of SFR2 activity. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> SFR2 in vitro activity is Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and its optimal pH is 7.5, similar to that of Arabidopsis SFR2, but the specific activity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> SFR2 in vitro is almost double that of Arabidopsis SFR2. When salt and drought stress were applied to Arabidopsis, no conditions could be identified at which SFR2 was induced prior to irreversibly impacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, suggesting that SFR2 protects Arabidopsis primarily against freezing. Discovery of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> SFR2 function in drought and salt resilience provides further insights into general membrane lipid remodeling-based stress tolerance mechanisms and together with protection against freezing in freezing-resistant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s such as Arabidopsis, it adds lipid remodeling as a possible target for the engineering of abiotic stress-resilient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s.</p>

A selective insecticidal protein from <i>Pseudomonas</i> for controlling corn rootworms
<p>The coleopteran insect western <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corn</span></strong> rootworm (WCR) (<i>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</i> LeConte) is a devastating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> pest in North America and Europe. Although <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s that produce <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> (<i>Bt</i>) proteins can limit insect infestation, some insect populations have evolved resistance to <i>Bt</i> proteins.

12-Oxo-Phytodienoic Acid Acts as a Regulator of Maize Defense against Corn Leaf Aphid
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corn</span></strong> leaf aphid (CLA; <i>Rhopalosiphum maidis</i>) is a phloem sap-sucking insect that attacks many cereal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>s, including maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We previously showed that the maize inbred line Mp708, which was developed by classical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> breeding, provides enhanced resistance to CLA. Here, using electrophysiological monitoring of aphid feeding behavior, we demonstrate that Mp708 provides phloem-mediated resistance to CLA. Furthermore, feeding by CLA on Mp708 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s enhanced callose deposition, a potential defense mechanism utilized by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to limit aphid feeding and subsequent colonization. In maize, benzoxazinoids (BX) or BX-derived metabolites contribute to enhanced callose deposition by providing heightened resistance to CLA. However, BX and BX-derived metabolites were not significantly altered in CLA-infested Mp708 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, indicating BX-independent defense against CLA. Evidence presented here suggests that the constitutively higher levels of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) in Mp708 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s contributed to enhanced callose accumulation and heightened CLA resistance. OPDA enhanced the expression of ethylene biosynthesis and receptor genes, and the synergistic interactions of OPDA and CLA feeding significantly induced the expression of the transcripts encoding Maize insect resistance1-Cysteine Protease, a key defensive protein against insect pests, in Mp708 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Furthermore, exogenous application of OPDA on maize jasmonic acid-deficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s caused enhanced callose accumulation and heightened resistance to CLA, suggesting that the OPDA-mediated resistance to CLA is independent of the jasmonic acid pathway. We further demonstrate that the signaling function of OPDA, rather than a direct toxic effect, contributes to enhanced CLA resistance in Mp708.</p>

A Group D MAPK Protects Plants from Autotoxicity by Suppressing Herbivore-Induced Defense Signaling
<p>The mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s activate and enhance defense responses have been well studied; however, the regulatory mechanisms that allow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to avoid excessive defense responses are poorly understood. Here, we identified a group D mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) gene from rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), <i>OsMAPK20-5</i>, whose expression was rapidly induced by infestation of gravid female adults of a destructive rice pest, brown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (BPH, <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>), but not by BPH nymphs. Expression silencing of <i>OsMAPK20-5</i> (irMAPK) increased the accumulation of ethylene and nitric oxide (NO) after gravid female BPH infestation, and thereby increased rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> resistance to BPH adults and oviposited eggs. However, when exposed to high densities of gravid BPH females, irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s wilted earlier than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, which could be attributed to the hyperaccumulation of ethylene and NO in irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Interestingly, when released into the field, irMAPK <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed broad resistance to BPH and white-backed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hopper (<i>Sogatella furcifera</i>), the two most destructive pests of rice, and produced higher yield. Taken together, our study shows that although OsMAPK20-5 can reduce the resistance of rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>hoppers, it also enables rice <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to control excessive defense responses and thereby prevents defense-response–related autotoxicity.</p>

Massive Tandem Proliferation of ELIPs Supports Convergent Evolution of Desiccation Tolerance across Land Plants
<p>Desiccation tolerance was a critical adaptation for the colonization of land by early nonvascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s have maintained or rewired these ancestral protective mechanisms, and desiccation-tolerant species are dispersed across the land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> phylogeny. Although common physiological, biochemical, and molecular signatures are observed across resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> lineages, features underlying the recurrent evolution of desiccation tolerance are unknown. Here we used a comparative approach to identify patterns of genome evolution and gene duplication associated with desiccation tolerance. We identified a single gene family with dramatic expansion in all sequenced resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> genomes and no expansion in desiccation-sensitive species. This gene family of early light-induced proteins (ELIPs) expanded in resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s convergent through repeated tandem gene duplication. ELIPs are universally highly expressed during desiccation in all surveyed resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and may play a role in protecting against photooxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus during prolonged dehydration. Photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to dehydration, and the increased abundance of ELIPs may help facilitate the rapid recovery observed for most resurrection <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Together, these observations support convergent evolution of desiccation tolerance in land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s through tandem gene duplication.</p>

Characterization of CRISPR Mutants Targeting Genes Modulating Pectin Degradation in Ripening Tomato
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) is a globally important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> with an economic value in the tens of billions of dollars, and a significant supplier of essential vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals in the human diet. Shelf life is a key quality trait related to alterations in cuticle properties and remodeling of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> cell walls. Studies with transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s undertaken over the last 20 years have indicated that a range of pectin-degrading enzymes are involved in cell wall remodeling. These studies usually involved silencing of only a single gene and it has proved difficult to compare the effects of silencing these genes across the different experimental systems. Here we report the generation of CRISPR-based mutants in the ripening-related genes encoding the pectin-degrading enzymes pectate lyase (PL), polygalacturonase 2a (PG2a), and β-galactanase (TBG4). Comparison of the physiochemical properties of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s from a range of <i>PL</i>, <i>PG2a</i>, and <i>TBG4</i> CRISPR lines demonstrated that only mutations in <i>PL</i> resulted in firmer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s, although mutations in <i>PG2a</i> and <i>TBG4</i> influenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> color and weight. Pectin localization, distribution, and solubility in the pericarp cells of the CRISPR mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s were investigated using the monoclonal antibody probes LM19 to deesterified homogalacturonan, INRA-RU1 to rhamnogalacturonan I, LM5 to β-1,4-galactan, and LM6 to arabinan epitopes, respectively. The data indicate that PL, PG2a, and TBG4 act on separate cell wall domains and the importance of cellulose microfibril-associated pectin is reflected in its increased occurrence in the different mutant lines.</p>

Pivotal Roles of Cryptochromes 1a and 2 in Tomato Development and Physiology
<p>Cryptochromes are flavin-containing blue/UVA light photoreceptors that regulate various <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> light-induced physiological processes. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), cryptochromes mediate de-etiolation, photoperiodic control of flowering, entrainment of the circadian clock, cotyledon opening and expansion, anthocyanin accumulation, and root growth. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>), cryptochromes are encoded by a multigene family, comprising <i>CRY1a</i>, <i>CRY1b</i>, <i>CRY2</i>, and <i>CRY3</i>. We have previously reported the phenotypes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <i>cry1a</i> mutants and <i>CRY2</i> overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Here, we report the isolation by targeting induced local lesions in genomes, of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <i>cry2</i> knock-out mutant, its introgression in the indeterminate Moneymaker background, and the phenotypes of <i>cry1a</i>/<i>cry2</i> single and double mutants. The <i>cry1a</i>/<i>cry2</i> mutant showed phenotypes similar to its Arabidopsis counterpart (long hypocotyls in white and blue light), but also several additional features such as increased seed weight and internode length, enhanced hypocotyl length in red light, inhibited primary root growth under different light conditions, anticipation of flowering under long-day conditions, and alteration of the phase of circadian leaf movements. Both cry1a and cry2 control the levels of photosynthetic pigments in leaves, but cry2 has a predominant role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> pigmentation. Metabolites of the sterol, tocopherol, quinone, and sugar classes are differentially accumulated in <i>cry1a</i> and <i>cry2</i> leaves and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s. These results demonstrate a pivotal role of cryptochromes in controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> development and physiology. The manipulation of these photoreceptors represents a powerful tool to influence important agronomic traits such as flowering time and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> quality.</p>

Leaf Amino Acid Supply Affects Photosynthetic and Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency under Nitrogen Stress
<p>The coordinated distribution of nitrogen to source leaves and sinks is essential for supporting leaf metabolism while also supplying sufficient nitrogen to seeds for development. This study aimed to understand how regulated amino acid allocation to leaves affects photosynthesis and overall <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and how soil nitrogen availability influences these processes. Arabidopsis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with a knockout of <i>AAP2</i>, encoding an amino acid permease involved in xylem-to-phloem transfer of root-derived amino acids, were grown in low-, moderate-, and high-nitrogen environments. We analyzed nitrogen allocation to shoot tissues, photosynthesis, and photosynthetic and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> nitrogen use efficiency in these knockout <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Our results demonstrate that, independent of nitrogen conditions, <i>aap2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s allocate more nitrogen to leaves than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Increased leaf nitrogen supply positively affected chlorophyll and Rubisco levels, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, and carbon assimilation and transport to sinks. The <i>aap2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s outperformed wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with respect to growth, seed yield and carbon storage pools, and nitrogen use efficiency in both high and deficient nitrogen environments. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing nitrogen allocation to leaves represents an effective strategy for improving carbon fixation and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. The results indicate that an optimized coordination of nitrogen and carbon partitioning processes is critical for high oilseed production in Arabidopsis, including in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exposed to limiting nitrogen conditions.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture is a key factor affecting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>ing density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> architecture in maize breeding.</p>

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of chemical genomics approaches allows the identification of small molecules that integrate into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of chemicals are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of chemical genomics and synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Here, each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>y. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into biochemical processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small molecules that modulate discrete <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> functions that could be produced later in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense compounds.</p>

Root Cortical Senescence Improves Growth under Suboptimal Availability of N, P, and K
<p>Root cortical senescence (RCS) in Triticeae reduces nutrient uptake, nutrient content, respiration, and radial hydraulic conductance of root tissue. We used the functional-structural model <i>SimRoot</i> to evaluate the functional implications of RCS in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) under suboptimal nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium availability. The utility of RCS was evaluated using sensitivity analyses in contrasting nutrient regimes. At flowering (80 d), RCS increased simulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth by up to 52%, 73%, and 41% in nitrate-, phosphorus-, and potassium-limiting conditions, respectively. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with RCS had reduced nutrient requirement of root tissue for optimal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, reduced total cumulative cortical respiration, and increased total carbon reserves. Nutrient reallocation during RCS had a greater effect on simulated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth than reduced respiration or nutrient uptake. Under low nutrient availability, RCS had greater benefit in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with fewer tillers. RCS had greater benefit in phenotypes with fewer lateral roots at low nitrate availability, but the opposite was true in low phosphorus or potassium availability. Additionally, RCS was quantified in field-grown <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> in different nitrogen regimes. Field and virtual soil coring simulation results demonstrated that living cortical volume per root length (an indicator of RCS) decreased with depth in younger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, while roots of older <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s had very little living cortical volume per root length. RCS may be an adaptive trait for nutrient acquisition by reallocating nutrients from senescing tissue and secondarily by reducing root respiration. These simulated results suggest that RCS merits investigation as a breeding target for enhanced soil resource acquisition and edaphic stress tolerance.</p>

A Subset of Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes Is Essential for Plant Immunity
<p>Of the three classes of enzymes involved in ubiquitination, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) have been often incorrectly considered to play merely an auxiliary role in the process, and few E2 enzymes have been investigated in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. To reveal the role of E2 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> innate immunity, we identified and cloned 40 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> genes encoding ubiquitin E2 proteins. Thioester assays indicated that the majority of the genes encode enzymatically active E2. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 40 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> E2 enzymes into 13 groups, of which members of group III were found to interact and act specifically with AvrPtoB, a <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong></i> effector that uses its ubiquitin ligase (E3) activity to suppress host immunity. Knocking down the expression of group III E2 genes in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> diminished the AvrPtoB-promoted degradation of the Fen kinase and the AvrPtoB suppression of host immunity-associated programmed cell death. Importantly, silencing group III E2 genes also resulted in reduced pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). By contrast, programmed cell death induced by several effector-triggered immunity elicitors was not affected on group III-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Functional characterization suggested redundancy among group III members for their role in the suppression of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> immunity by AvrPtoB and in PTI and identified UBIQUITIN-CONJUGATING11 (UBC11), UBC28, UBC29, UBC39, and UBC40 as playing a more significant role in PTI than other group III members. Our work builds a foundation for the further characterization of E2s in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> immunity and reveals that AvrPtoB has evolved a strategy for suppressing host immunity that is difficult for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> to thwart.</p>

Effect of source/sink ratios on yield components, growth dynamics and structural characteristics of oil palm (<i>Elaeis guineensis</i>) bunches
<p>Source/sink ratios are known to be one of the main determinants of oil palm growth and development. A long-term experiment (9 years) was conducted in Indonesia on mature oil palms subjected to continuous bunch ablation and partial defoliation treatments to artificially modify source/sink ratios. During the experiment, all harvested bunches were dissected and phenological measurements were carried out to analyse the effect of source/sink ratios on yield components explaining variations in bunch number, the number of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>s per bunch and oil dry weight per <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>. An integrative variable (supply/demand ratio) describing the ratio between the assimilate supply from sources and the growing organ demand for carbohydrate was computed for each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> on a daily basis from observations of the number of developing organs and their sink strength, and of climate variables. Defoliation and bunch ablation affected the bunch number and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> number per bunch. Variations in bunch number per month were mainly due to variations in the fraction of aborted inflorescence and in the ratio between female and male inflorescences. Under fluctuating trophic conditions, variations in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> number per bunch resulted both from changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong>-set and in the number of branches (rachillae) per inflorescence. For defoliated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, the decrease in the number of developing reproductive sinks appeared to be sufficient to maintain <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">fruit</span></strong> weight and oil concentration at the control level, without any major decrease in the concentration of non-structural carbohydrate reserves. Computation of the supply/demand ratio revealed that each yield component had a specific phase of sensitivity to supply/demand ratios during inflorescence development. Establishing quantitative relationships between supply/demand ratios, competition and yield components is the first step towards a functional model for oil palm.</p>

Amino acid sequences of 73 species (62 land <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and 11 green algae), containing 2,682,261 sequences, were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Reference Sequence database. Based on NCBI BLAST searches between these sequences, homologous genes were grouped at various thresholds of homology indices devised by the authors. To show functional and evolutionary traits of a gene of interest, a phylogenetic tree, connecting genes with high homology indices, and line charts of the numbers of genes with various homology indices, are depicted. In addition, such indices are projected on a network graph in which species studied are connected based on the ratios of homologous genes, and on a phylogenetic tree for species based on NCBI Taxonomy. G<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">corn</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> provides information on homologous genes at various virtual time points along with speciation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Mesophyll Abscisic Acid Restrains Early Growth and Flowering But Does Not Directly Suppress Photosynthesis
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA) levels increase significantly in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s under stress conditions, and ABA is thought to serve as a key stress-response regulator. However, the direct effect of ABA on photosynthesis and the effect of mesophyll ABA on yield under both well-watered and drought conditions are still the subject of debate. Here, we examined this issue using transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s carrying a dominant ABA-signaling inhibitor under the control of a mesophyll-specific promoter (<i>FBPase::abi1-1</i>, abbreviated to <i>fa</i>). Under normal conditions, <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s displayed slightly higher stomatal conductance and carbon assimilation than wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s; however, these parameters were comparable following ABA treatment. These observations suggest that ABA does not directly inhibit photosynthesis in the short term. The <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also exhibited a variety of altered phenotypes under optimal conditions, including more vigorous initial growth, earlier flowering, smaller flowers, and delayed chlorophyll degradation. Furthermore, under optimal conditions, <i>fa</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> seed production was less than a third of that observed for the wild type. However, under drought conditions, wild-type and <i>fa</i> seed yields were similar due to a significant reduction in wild-type seed and no reduction in <i>fa</i> seed. These findings suggest that endogenous basal ABA inhibits a stress-escape response under nonstressed conditions, allowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s to accumulate biomass and maximize yield. The lack of a correlation between flowering time and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> biomass combined with delayed chlorophyll degradation suggests that this stress-escape behavior is regulated independently and upstream of other ABA-induced effects such as rapid growth and flowering.</p>

The Role of Gβ Protein in Controlling Cell Expansion via Potential Interaction with Lipid Metabolic Pathways
<p>Heterotrimeric G-proteins influence almost all aspects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, likely via their interaction with specific effectors. However, the identity of such effectors and their mechanism of action are mostly unknown. While investigating the roles of different G-protein subunits in modulating the oil content in Camelina (<i>Camelina sativa</i>), an oil seed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong>, we uncovered a role of Gβ proteins in controlling anisotropic cell expansion. Knockdown of <i>Gβ</i> genes causes reduced longitudinal and enhanced transverse expansion, resulting in altered cell, tissue, and organ shapes in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s during vegetative and reproductive development. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s also exhibited substantial changes in their fatty acid and phospholipid profiles, which possibly leads to the increased oil content of the transgenic seeds. This increase is potentially caused by the direct interaction of Gβ proteins with a specific patatin-like phospholipase, pPLAIIIδ. Camelina <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with suppressed <i>Gβ</i> expression exhibit higher lipase activity, and show phenotypes similar to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s overexpressing <i>pPLAIIIδ</i>, suggesting that the Gβ proteins are negative regulators of pPLAIIIδ. These results reveal interactions between the G-protein–mediated and lipid signaling/metabolic pathways, where specific phospholipases may act as effectors that control key developmental and environmental responses of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

Components of Water Use Efficiency Have Unique Genetic Signatures in the Model C<sub>4</sub> Grass <i>Setaria</i>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> growth and water use are interrelated processes influenced by genetically controlled morphological and biochemical characteristics. Improving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> water use efficiency (WUE) to sustain growth in different environments is an important breeding objective that can improve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> yields and enhance agricultural sustainability. However, genetic improvement of WUE using traditional methods has proven difficult due to the low throughput and environmental heterogeneity of field settings. To overcome these limitations, this study utilizes a high-throughput phenotyping platform to quantify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size and water use of an interspecific <i>Setaria italica</i> × <i>Setaria viridis</i> recombinant inbred line population at daily intervals in both well-watered and water-limited conditions. Our findings indicate that measurements of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size and water use are correlated strongly in this system; therefore, a linear modeling approach was used to partition this relationship into predicted values of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size given water use and deviations from this relationship at the genotype level. The resulting traits describing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> size, water use, and WUE all were heritable and responsive to soil water availability, allowing for a genetic dissection of the components of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> WUE under different watering treatments. Linkage mapping identified major loci underlying two different pleiotropic components of WUE. This study indicates that alleles controlling WUE derived from both wild and domesticated accessions can be utilized to predictably modulate trait values given a specified precipitation regime in the model C<sub>4</sub> genus <i>Setaria</i>.</p>

Sucrose Nonfermenting 1-Related Protein Kinase 1 Phosphorylates a Geminivirus Rep Protein to Impair Viral Replication and Infection
<p>Geminiviruses are single-stranded DNA viruses that infect a wide variety of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and cause severe <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> losses worldwide. The geminivirus replication initiator protein (Rep) binds to the viral replication origin and catalyzes DNA cleavage and ligation to initiate rolling circle replication. In this study, we found that the <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> golden mosaic virus</i> (TGMV) Rep is phosphorylated at serine-97 by sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1), a master regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> energy homeostasis and metabolism. Phosphorylation of Rep or the phosphomimic S97D mutation impaired Rep binding to viral DNA. A TGMV DNA-A replicon containing the Rep S97D mutation replicated less efficiently in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) protoplasts than in wild-type or Rep phosphorylation-deficient replicons. The TGMV Rep-S97D mutant also was less infectious than the wild-type virus in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and was unable to infect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>). Nearly all geminivirus Rep proteins have a serine residue at the position equivalent to TGMV Rep serine-97. SnRK1 phosphorylated the equivalent serines in the Rep proteins of <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> mottle virus</i> and <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> yellow leaf curl virus</i> and reduced DNA binding, suggesting that SnRK1 plays a key role in combating geminivirus infection. These results established that SnRK1 phosphorylates Rep and interferes with geminivirus replication and infection, underscoring the emerging role for SnRK1 in the host defense response against <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> pathogens.</p>

Out of Water: The Origin and Early Diversification of Plant <i>R</i>-Genes
<p>During <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-pathogen interactions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s use intracellular proteins with nucleotide-binding site and Leu-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) domains to detect pathogens. NBS-LRR proteins represent a major class of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> diseas</span></strong>e resistance genes (<i>R</i>-genes). Whereas <i>R</i>-genes have been well characterized in angiosperms, little is known about their origin and early diversification. Here, we perform comprehensive evolutionary analyses of <i>R</i>-genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s and report the identification of <i>R</i>-genes in basal-branching streptophytes, including charophytes, liverworts, and mosses. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> <i>R</i>-genes originated in charophytes and R-proteins diversified into TIR-NBS-LRR proteins and non-TIR-NBS-LRR proteins in charophytes. Moreover, we show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> R-proteins evolved in a modular fashion through frequent gain or loss of protein domains. Most of the <i>R</i>-genes in basal-branching streptophytes underwent adaptive evolution, indicating an ancient involvement of <i>R</i>-genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>-pathogen interactions. Our findings provide novel insights into the origin and evolution of <i>R</i>-genes and the mechanisms underlying colonization of terrestrial environments by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s.</p>

The MtDMI2-MtPUB2 Negative Feedback Loop Plays a Role in Nodulation Homeostasis
<p>DOES NOT MAKE INFECTION 2 (MtDMI2) is a Leu rich repeat-type receptor kinase required for signal transduction in the <i>Medicago truncatula/Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> symbiosis pathway. However, the mechanisms through which MtDMI2 participates in nodulation homeostasis are poorly understood. In this study, we identified MtPUB2—a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> U-box (PUB)–type E3 ligase—and showed that it interacts with MtDMI2. MtDMI2 and MtPUB2 accumulation were shown to be similar in various tissues. Roots of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s in which <i>MtPUB2</i> was silenced by RNAi (<i>MtPUB2-</i>RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s) exhibited impaired infection threads, fewer nodules, and shorter primary root lengths compared to those of control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s transformed with empty vector. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we showed that MtDMI2 phosphorylates MtPUB2 at Ser-316, Ser-421, and Thr-488 residues. When <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s were transformed with <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup></i>, which mimics the phosphorylated state, MtDMI2 was persistently ubiquitinated and degraded by MtPUB2<sup>S421D</sup>, resulting in fewer nodules than observed in <i>MtPUB2</i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. However, <i>MtPUB2<sup>S421A</sup></i>/<i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi-complemented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s showed no MtPUB2 ubiquitination activity, and their nodulation phenotype was similar to that of <i>MtPUB2</i>-RNAi <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s transformed with empty vector. Further studies demonstrated that these proteins form a negative feedback loop of the prey (MtDMI2)-predator (MtPUB2) type. Our results suggest that the MtDMI2-MtPUB2 negative feedback loop, which displays crosstalk with the long-distance autoregulation of nodulation via MtNIN, plays an important role in nodulation homeostasis.</p>

Heat Shock Factor HsfA1a Is Essential for <i>R</i> Gene-Mediated Nematode Resistance and Triggers H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Production<sup>1</sup>
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the apoplast in response to pathogen attack, especially following resistance (<i>R</i>) gene-mediated pathogen recognition; however, the mechanisms activating ROS generation remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that RKN (<i>Meloidogyne incognita</i>) infection rapidly induces ROS accumulation in the roots of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s that contain the <i>R</i> gene <i>Mi-1.2</i> but rarely induces ROS accumulation in the susceptible or <i>Mi-1.2</i>-silenced resistant genotypes. RNK also induces the hypersensitive response, a form of programmed cell death, in <i>Mi-1.2</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. RKN induces the expression of numerous class-A heat shock factor (HsfA) genes in resistant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Silencing <i>HsfA1a</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated resistance, apoplastic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation, and the transcription of <i>whitefly induced 1</i> (<i>Wfi1</i>), which encodes a respiratory burst oxidase homolog. HsfA1a regulates <i>Wfi1</i> transcription by binding to the <i>Wfi1</i> promoter, and silencing of <i>Wfi1</i> compromises <i>Mi-1.2</i>-mediated resistance. HsfA1a and Wfi1 are involved in Mi-1.2-triggered Hsp90 accumulation and basal defense in susceptible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong>. Thus, HsfA–1aWfi1-dependent ROS signaling functions as a crucial regulator of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> defense responses.</p>

A New Barley Stripe Mosaic Virus Allows Large Protein Overexpression for Rapid Function Analysis
<p>Understanding the genetic and molecular bases of gene function is of increasing importance to harness their potential to produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s with novel traits. One important objective is the improvement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> productivity to meet future demands in food <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">crop</span></strong> production. Gene function is mostly characterized through overexpression or silencing in transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. This approach is a lengthy procedure, especially in cereals. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> viral expression systems can be used for rapid expression of proteins. However, current systems have a small cargo capacity and have mostly been used for gene silencing. Here, a four-component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> stripe mosaic virus-based system with high cargo capacity was constructed for the rapid and stable expression of recombinant proteins in different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> species, allowing function analyses at different stages of development. Fluorescent marker proteins are expressed at high levels within 1 week, and a proof of efficient function analysis is shown using the aluminum malate transporter1 gene. In addition to the ability of gene cotransformation, this work demonstrates that the four-component <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">barley</span></strong> stripe mosaic virus-based system allows the overexpression of cDNAs of up to 2,100 nucleotides (encoding a protein of ∼78 kD), thereby providing an invaluable tool to accelerate functional genomics and proteomic research in monocot and dicot species.</p>

The Distinct Roles of Class I and II RPD3-Like Histone Deacetylases in Salinity Stress Response
<p>Histone acetylation is an essential process in the epigenetic regulation of diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes, including environmental stress responses in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. Previously, our research group identified a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (HDI) that confers salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In this study, we demonstrate that class I HDAC (HDA19) and class II HDACs (HDA5/14/15/18) control responses to salt stress through different pathways. The screening of 12 different selective HDIs indicated that seven newly reported HDIs enhance salt tolerance. Genetic analysis, based on a pharmacological study, identified which HDACs function in salinity stress tolerance. In the wild-type Columbia-0 background, <i>hda19</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibit tolerance to high-salinity stress, while <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s exhibit hypersensitivity to salt stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the effect of <i>HDA19</i> deficiency on the response to salinity stress is distinct from that of <i>HDA5/14/15/18</i> deficiencies. In <i>hda19</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, the expression levels of stress tolerance-related genes, late embryogenesis abundant proteins that prevent protein aggregation and positive regulators such as ABI5 and NAC019 in abscisic acid signaling, were induced strongly relative to the wild type. Neither of these elements was up-regulated in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The mutagenesis of HDA19 by genome editing in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting that suppression of HDA19 masks the phenotype caused by the suppression of class II HDACs in the salinity stress response. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HDIs that inhibit class I HDACs allow the rescue of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s from salinity stress regardless of their selectivity, and they provide insight into the hierarchal regulation of environmental stress responses through HDAC isoforms.</p>

A Nucleus-Localized Long Non-Coding RNA Enhances Drought and Salt Stress Tolerance
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect gene expression through a wide range of mechanisms and are considered as important regulators in many essential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical processes. A large number of lncRNA transcripts have been predicted or identified in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s in recent years. However, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biolog</span></strong>ical functions for most of them are still unknown. In this study, we identified an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) lncRNA, <i>DROUGHT INDUCED lncRNA</i> (<i>DRIR</i>), as a novel positive regulator of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> response to drought and salt stress. <i>DRIR</i> was expressed at a low level under nonstress conditions but can be significantly activated by drought and salt stress as well as by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. We identified a T-DNA insertion mutant, <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i>, which had higher expression of the <i>DRIR</i> gene than the wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant exhibits increased tolerance to drought and salt stress. Overexpressing <i>DRIR</i> in Arabidopsis also increased tolerance to drought and salt stress of the transgenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> mutant and the overexpressing seedlings are more sensitive to ABA than the wild type in stomata closure and seedling growth. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the expression of a large number of genes was altered in <i>drir<sup>D</sup></i> and the overexpressing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. These include genes involved in ABA signaling, water transport, and other stress-relief processes. Our study reveals a mechanism whereby <i>DRIR</i> regulates the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> response to abiotic stress by modulating the expression of a series of genes involved in the stress response.</p>

Phospholipase C2 Affects MAMP-Triggered Immunity by Modulating ROS Production
<p>The activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) is one of the earliest responses triggered by the recognition of several microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s. The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) PI-PLC gene family is composed of nine members. Previous studies suggested a role for PLC2 in MAMP-triggered immunity, as it is rapidly phosphorylated in vivo upon treatment with the bacterial MAMP flg22. Here, we analyzed the role of PLC2 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong> immunity using an artificial microRNA to silence <i>PLC2</i> expression in Arabidopsis. We found that <i>PLC2</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s are more susceptible to the type III secretion system-deficient bacterial strain <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">tomato</span></strong></i> (<i>Pst</i>) DC3000 <i>hrcC<sup>−</sup></i> and to the nonadapted pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) powdery mildew <i>Erysiphe pisi</i>. However, <i>PLC2</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s display normal susceptibility to virulent (<i>Pst</i> DC3000) and avirulent (<i>Pst</i> DC3000 AvrRPM1) <i>P. syringae</i> strains, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">conserv</span></strong>ing typical hypersensitive response features. In response to flg22, <i>PLC2</i>-silenced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s maintain wild-type mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and <i>PHI1</i>, <i>WRKY33</i>, and <i>FRK1</i> immune marker gene expression but have reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent responses such as callose deposition and stomatal closure. Accordingly, the generation of ROS upon flg22 treatment is compromised in the <i>PLC2</i>-defficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">plant</span></strong>s, suggesting an effect of PLC2 in a branch of MAMP-triggered immunity and nonhost resistance that involves early ROS-regulated processes. Consistently, PLC2 associates with the NADPH oxidase RBOHD, suggesting its potential regulation by PLC2.</p>

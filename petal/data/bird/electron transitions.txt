Isostructural metal-insulator transition in VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>The metal-insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion in correlated materials is usually coupled to a symmetry-lowering structural phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion. This coupling not only complicates the understanding of the basic mechanism of this phenomenon but also limits the speed and endurance of prospective electronic devices. We demonstrate an isostructural, purely electronically driven metal-insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion in epitaxial heterostructures of an archetypal correlated material, vanadium dioxide. A combination of thin-film synthesis, structural and electrical characterizations, and theoretical modeling reveals that an interface interaction suppresses the electronic correlations without changing the crystal structure in this otherwise correlated insulator. This interaction stabilizes a nonequilibrium metallic phase and leads to an isostructural metal-insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion. This discovery will provide insights into phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions of correlated materials and may aid the design of device functionalities.</p>

Regulating the femtosecond excited-state lifetime of a single molecule
<p>The key to controlling reactions of molecules induced with the current of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip is the ultrashort intermediate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed ionic state. The initial condition of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state is set by the energy and position of the injected current; thereafter, its dynamics determines the reaction outcome. We show that a STM can directly and controllably influence the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state dynamics. For the STM-induced desorption of toluene molecules from the Si(111)-7x7 surface, as the tip approaches the molecule, the probability of manipulation drops by two orders of magnitude. A two-channel quenching of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state is proposed, consisting of an invariant surface channel and a tip height–dependent channel. We conclude that picometer tip proximity regulates the lifetime of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state from 10 femtoseconds to less than 0.1 femtoseconds.</p>

Photosensitized, energy transfer-mediated organometallic catalysis through electronically excited nickel(II)
<p>Transition metal catalysis has traditionally relied on organometallic complexes that can cycle through a series of ground-state oxidation levels to achieve a series of discrete yet fundamental fragment-coupling steps. The viability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state organometallic catalysis via direct photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation has been demonstrated. Although the utility of triplet sensitization by energy transfer has long been known as a powerful activation mode in organic photochemistry, it is surprising to recognize that photosensitization mechanisms to access <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state organometallic catalysts have lagged far behind. Here, we demonstrate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state organometallic catalysis via such an activation pathway: Energy transfer from an iridium sensitizer produces an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed-state nickel complex that couples aryl halides with carboxylic acids. Detailed mechanistic studies confirm the role of photosensitization via energy transfer.</p>

Developmental Changes in Scots Pine Transcriptome during Heartwood Formation
<p>Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) wood is desired in woodworking industries due to its favorable timber characteristics and natural durability that is contributed by heartwood extractives. It has been discussed whether the Scots pine heartwood extractives (mainly stilbenes and resin acids) are synthesized in the cells of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone between sapwood and heartwood, or if they are transported from the sapwood. Timing of heartwood formation during the yearly cycle has also not been unambiguously defined. We measured steady-state mRNA levels in Scots pine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone and sapwood using RNA sequencing. Year-round expression profiles of selected transcripts were further investigated by quantitative RT-PCR. Differentially accumulating transcripts suggest that, of the Scots pine heartwood extractives, stilbenes are synthesized in situ in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone and gain their carbon-skeletons from Suc and triglycerides. Resin acids, on the other hand, are synthesized early in the spring mainly in the sapwood, meaning that they must be transported to the heartwood <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone. Heartwood formation is marked by programmed cell death that occurs during the summer months in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone.</p>

Comparative Analysis of Light-Harvesting Antennae and State Transition in <i>chlorina</i> and cpSRP Mutants
<p>State <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions in photosynthesis provide for the dynamic allocation of a mobile fraction of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) to photosystem II (PSII) in state I and to photosystem I (PSI) in state II. In the state I-to-state II <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion, LHCII is phosphorylated by STN7 and associates with PSI to favor absorption cross-section of PSI. Here, we used Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) mutants with defects in chlorophyll (Chl) b biosynthesis or in the chloroplast signal recognition particle (cpSRP) machinery to study the flexible formation of PS-LHC supercomplexes. Intriguingly, we found that impaired Chl b biosynthesis in <i>chlorina1-2</i> (<i>ch1-2</i>) led to preferentially stabilized LHCI rather than LHCII, while the contents of both LHCI and LHCII were equally depressed in the cpSRP43-deficient mutant (<i>chaos</i>). In view of recent findings on the modified state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions in LHCI-deficient mutants (Benson et al., 2015), the <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> mutants were used to assess the influence of varying LHCI/LHCII antenna size on state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions. Under state II conditions, LHCII-PSI supercomplexes were not formed in both <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> plants. LHCII phosphorylation was drastically reduced in <i>ch1-2</i>, and the inactivation of STN7 correlates with the lack of state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions. In contrast, phosphorylated LHCII in <i>chaos</i> was observed to be exclusively associated with PSII complexes, indicating a lack of mobile LHCII in <i>chaos</i>. Thus, the comparative analysis of <i>ch1-2</i> and <i>chaos</i> mutants provides new evidence for the flexible organization of LHCs and enhances our understanding of the reversible allocation of LHCII to the two photosystems.</p>

The joint influence of photoperiod and temperature during growth cessation and development of dormancy in white spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>)
<p>Timely responses to environmental cues enable the synchronization of phenological life-history <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions essential for the health and survival of north-temperate and boreal tree species. While photoperiodic cues will remain persistent under climate change, temperature cues may vary, contributing to possible asynchrony in signals influencing developmental and physiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions essential to forest health. Understanding the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature as determinants of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion from active growth to dormancy is important for informing adaptive forest management decisions that consider future climates. Using a combination of photoperiod (long = 20 h or short = 8 h day lengths) and temperature (warm = 22 °C/16 °C and cool = 8 °C/4 °C day/night, respectively) treatments, we used microscopy, physiology and modeling to comprehensively examine hallmark traits of the growth–dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion—including bud formation, growth cessation, cold hardiness and gas exchange—within two provenances of white spruce [<i>Picea glauca</i> (Moench) Voss] spanning a broad latitude in Alberta, Canada. Following exposure to experimental treatments, seedlings were transferred to favorable conditions, and the depth of dormancy was assessed by determining the timing and ability of spruce seedlings to resume growth. Short photoperiods promoted bud development and growth cessation, whereas longer photoperiods extended the growing season through the induction of lammas growth. In contrast, cool temperatures under both photoperiodic conditions delayed bud development. Photoperiod strongly predicted the development of cold hardiness, whereas temperature predicted photosynthetic rates associated with active growth. White spruce was capable of attaining endodormancy, but its release was environmentally determined. Dormancy depth varied substantially across experimental treatments suggesting that environmental cues experienced within one season could affect growth in the following season, which is particularly important for a determinate species such as white spruce. The joint influence of these environmental cues points toward the importance of including local constant photoperiod and shifting temperature cues into predictive models that consider how climate change may affect northern forests.</p>

A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress
<p>Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased activity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission increased neuronal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, reduced GABAergic transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased activity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF exposure. Activating SK channels or inhibiting postsynaptic PKA activity prevented the effects of both CRF and maternal deprivation on LHb intrinsic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ability, thus identifying potential pharmacological targets to reverse central CRF circuit dysregulation in patients with associated disorders.</p>

Ultrafast disordering of vanadium dimers in photoexcited VO<sub>2</sub>
<p>Many ultrafast solid phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions are treated as chemical reactions that transform the structures between two different unit cells along a reaction coordinate, but this neglects the role of disorder. Although ultrafast diffraction provides insights into atomic dynamics during such transformations, diffraction alone probes an averaged unit cell and is less sensitive to randomness in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion pathway. Using total scattering of femtosecond x-ray pulses, we show that atomic disordering in photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed vanadium dioxide (VO<sub>2</sub>) is central to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion mechanism and that, after photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation, the system explores a large volume of phase space on a time scale comparable to that of a single phonon oscillation.

An intrinsic S/G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint enforced by ATR
<p>The cell cycle is strictly ordered to ensure faithful genome duplication and chromosome segregation. Control mechanisms establish this order by dictating when a cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions from one phase to the next. Much is known about the control of the G<sub>1</sub>/S, G<sub>2</sub>/M, and metaphase/anaphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions, but thus far, no control mechanism has been identified for the S/G<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion. Here we show that cells transactivate the mitotic gene network as they exit the S phase through a CDK1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1)–directed FOXM1 phosphorylation switch. During normal DNA replication, the checkpoint kinase ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related) is activated by ETAA1 to block this switch until the S phase ends. ATR inhibition prematurely activates FOXM1, deregulating the S/G<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion and leading to early mitosis, underreplicated DNA, and DNA damage. Thus, ATR couples DNA replication with mitosis and preserves genome integrity by enforcing an S/G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint.</p>

Topological insulator laser: Theory
<p>Topological insulators are phases of matter characterized by topological edge states that propagate in a unidirectional manner that is robust to imperfections and disorder. These attributes make topological insulator systems ideal candidates for enabling applications in quantum computation and spintronics. We propose a concept that exploits topological effects in a unique way: the topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r. These are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>rs whose lasing mode exhibits topologically protected transport without magnetic fields. The underlying topological properties lead to a highly efficient <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r, robust to defects and disorder, with single-mode lasing even at very high gain values. The topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r alters current understanding of the interplay between disorder and lasing, and at the same time opens <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ing possibilities in topological physics, such as topologically protected transport in systems with gain. On the technological side, the topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r provides a route to arrays of semiconductor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>rs that operate as one single-mode high-power <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r coupled efficiently into an output port.</p>

A liquid-liquid transition in supercooled aqueous solution related to the HDA-LDA transition
<p>Simulations and theory suggest that the thermodynamic anomalies of water may be related to a phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion between two supercooled liquid states, but so far this phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion has not been observed experimentally because of preemptive ice crystallization. We used calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate a water-rich hydrazinium trifluoroacetate solution in which the local hydrogen bond structure surrounding a water molecule resembles that in neat water at elevated pressure, but which does not crystallize upon cooling. Instead, this solution underwent a sharp, reversible phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion between two homogeneous liquid states. The hydrogen-bond structures of these two states are similar to those established for high- and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Such structural similarity supports theories that predict a similar sharp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion in pure water under pressure if ice crystallization could be suppressed.</p>

Boron Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity by Promoting Root Alkalization in Transition Zone via Polar Auxin Transport
<p>Boron (B) alleviates aluminum (Al) toxicity in higher plants; however, the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we used bromocresol green pH indicator, noninvasive microtest, and microelectrode ion flux estimation techniques to demonstrate that B promotes root surface pH gradients in pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) roots, leading to alkalization in the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone and acidification in the elongation zone, while Al inhibits these pH gradients. B significantly decreased Al accumulation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone (∼1.0–2.5 mm from the apex) of lateral roots, thereby alleviating Al-induced inhibition of root elongation. Net indole acetic acid (IAA) efflux detected by an IAA-sensitive platinum microelectrode showed that polar auxin transport, which peaked in the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone, was inhibited by Al toxicity, while it was partially recovered by B. Electrophysiological experiments using the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) auxin transporter mutants (<i>auxin resistant1-7</i>; <i>pin-formed2</i> [<i>pin2</i>]) and the specific polar auxin transporter inhibitor1-naphthylphthalamic acid showed that PIN2-based polar auxin transport is involved in root surface alkalization in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone. Our results suggest that B promotes polar auxin transport driven by the auxin efflux transporter PIN2 and leads to the downstream regulation of the plasma membrane-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, resulting in elevated root surface pH, which is essential to decrease Al accumulation in this Al-targeted apical root zone. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the role of exogenous B in alleviation of Al accumulation and toxicity in plants.</p>

The Transcription Factor ATHB5 Affects GA-Mediated Plasticity in Hypocotyl Cell Growth during Seed Germination
<p>Gibberellic acid (GA)-mediated cell expansion initiates the seed-to-seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion in plants and is repressed by DELLA proteins. Using digital single-cell analysis, we identified a cellular subdomain within the midhypocotyl, whose expansion drives the final step of this developmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion under optimal conditions. Using network inference, the transcription factor ATHB5 was identified as a genetic factor whose localized expression promotes GA-mediated expansion specifically within these cells. Both this protein and its putative growth-promoting target <i>EXPANSIN3</i> are repressed by DELLA, and coregulated at single-cell resolution during seed germination. The cellular domains of hormone sensitivity were explored within the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) embryo by putting seeds under GA-limiting conditions and quantifying cellular growth responses. The middle and upper hypocotyl have a greater requirement for GA to promote cell expansion than the lower embryo axis. Under these conditions, germination was still completed following enhanced growth within the radicle and lower axis. Under GA-limiting conditions, the <i>athb5</i> mutant did not show a phenotype at the level of seed germination, but it did at a cellular level with reduced cell expansion in the hypocotyl relative to the wild type. These data reveal that the spatiotemporal cell expansion events driving this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion are not determinate, and the conditional use of GA-ATHB5-mediated hypocotyl growth under optimal conditions may be used to optionally support rapid seedling growth. This study demonstrates that multiple genetic and spatiotemporal cell expansion mechanisms underlie the seed to seedling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion in Arabidopsis.</p>

Terahertz field–induced ferroelectricity in quantum paraelectric SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
<p>“Hidden phases” are metastable collective states of matter that are typically not accessible on equilibrium phase diagrams.

Single-cell transcriptomics of the mouse kidney reveals potential cellular targets of kidney disease

Synaptic transmission from subplate neurons controls radial migration of neocortical neurons

<p>Physical systems exhibiting topological invariants are naturally endowed with robustness against perturbations, as manifested in topological insulators—materials exhibiting robust electron transport, immune from scattering by defects and disorder. Recent years have witnessed intense efforts toward exploiting these phenomena in photonics. Here we demonstrate a nonmagnetic topological insulator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r system exhibiting topologically protected transport in the cavity. Its topological properties give rise to single-mode lasing, robustness against defects, and considerably higher slope efficiencies compared to the topologically trivial counterparts. We further exploit the properties of active topological platforms by assembling the system from <i>S</i>-chiral microresonators, enforcing predetermined unidirectional lasing without magnetic fields. This work paves the way toward active topological devices with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ing properties and functionalities.</p>

Light amplification by seeded Kerr instability
<p>Amplification of femtosecond <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r pulses typically requires a lasing medium or a nonlinear crystal. In either case, the chemical properties of the lasing medium or the momentum conservation in the nonlinear crystal constrain the frequency and the bandwidth of the amplified pulses. We demonstrate high gain amplification (greater than 1000) of widely tunable (0.5 to 2.2 micrometers) and short (less than 60 femtosecond) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r pulses, up to intensities of 1 terawatt per square centimeter, by seeding the modulation instability in an Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> crystal pumped by femtosecond near-infrared pulses. Our method avoids constraints related to doping and phase matching and therefore can occur in a wider pool of glasses and crystals even at far-infrared frequencies and for single-cycle pulses. Such amplified pulses are ideal to study strong-field processes in solids and highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed states in gases.</p>

Signatures of exciton condensation in a transition metal dichalcogenide
<p>Bose condensation has shaped our understanding of macroscopic quantum phenomena, having been realized in superconductors, atomic gases, and liquid helium. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ons are bosons that have been predicted to condense into either a superfluid or an insulating electronic crystal. Using the recently developed technique of momentum‐resolved electron energy‐loss spectroscopy (M-EELS), we studied electronic collective modes in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion metal dichalcogenide semimetal 1<i>T</i>‐TiSe<sub>2</sub>. Near the phase-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion temperature (190 kelvin), the energy of the electronic mode fell to zero at nonzero momentum, indicating dynamical slowing of plasma fluctuations and crystallization of the valence electrons into an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>on condensate. Our study provides compelling evidence for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>on condensation in a three-dimensional solid and establishes M-EELS as a versatile technique sensitive to valence band <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ations in quantum materials.</p>

Encoding of vinylidene isomerization in its anion photoelectron spectrum
<p>Vinylidene-acetylene isomerization is the prototypical example of a 1,2-hydrogen shift, one of the most important classes of isomerization reactions in organic chemistry. This reaction was investigated with quantum state specificity by high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy of the vinylidene anions H<sub>2</sub>CC and D<sub>2</sub>CC and quantum dynamics calculations. Peaks in the photoelectron spectra are considerably narrower than in previous work and reveal subtleties in the isomerization dynamics of neutral vinylidene, as well as vibronic coupling with an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state of vinylidene. Comparison with theory permits assignment of most spectral features to eigenstates dominated by vinylidene character. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation of the ν<sub>6</sub> in-plane rocking mode in H<sub>2</sub>CC results in appreciable tunneling-facilitated mixing with highly vibrationally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed states of acetylene, leading to broadening and/or spectral fine structure that is largely suppressed for analogous vibrational levels of D<sub>2</sub>CC.</p>

Transition from turbulent to coherent flows in confined three-dimensional active fluids
<p>Transport of fluid through a pipe is essential for the operation of macroscale machines and microfluidic devices. Conventional fluids only flow in response to external pressure. We demonstrate that an active isotropic fluid, composed of microtubules and molecular motors, autonomously flows through meter-long three-dimensional channels. We establish control over the magnitude, velocity profile, and direction of the self-organized flows and correlate these to the structure of the extensile microtubule bundles. The inherently three-dimensional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion from bulk-turbulent to confined-coherent flows occurs concomitantly with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion in the bundle orientational order near the surface and is controlled by a scale-invariant criterion related to the channel profile. The nonequilibrium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion of confined isotropic active fluids can be used to engineer self-organized soft machines.</p>

Enantioselective photochemistry through Lewis acid–catalyzed triplet energy transfer
<p>Relatively few catalytic systems are able to control the stereochemistry of electronically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed organic intermediates. Here we report the discovery that a chiral Lewis acid complex can catalyze triplet energy transfer from an electronically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed photosensitizer. We applied this strategy to asymmetric [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of 2′-hydroxychalcones, using tris(bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) as a sensitizer. A variety of electrochemical, computational, and spectroscopic data rule out substrate activation by means of photoinduced electron transfer and instead support a mechanism in which Lewis acid coordination dramatically lowers the triplet energy of the chalcone substrate. We expect that this approach will enable chemists to more broadly apply their detailed understanding of chiral Lewis acid catalysis to stereocontrol in reactions involving electronically <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed states.</p>

CLASP Facilitates Transitions between Cortical Microtubule Array Patterns
<p>Acentrosomal plant microtubule arrays form patterns at the cell cortex that influence cellular morphogenesis by templating the deposition of cell wall materials, but the molecular basis by which the microtubules form the cortical array patterns remains largely unknown. Loss of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) microtubule-associated protein, CYTOPLASMIC LINKER ASSOCIATED PROTEIN (AtCLASP), results in cellular growth anisotropy defects in hypocotyl cells. We examined the microtubule array patterning in <i>atclasp-1</i> null mutants and discovered a significant defect in the timing of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions between array patterns but no substantive defect in the array patterns per se. Detailed analysis and computational modeling of the microtubule dynamics in two <i>atclasp-1</i> fluorescent tubulin marker lines revealed marker-dependent effects on depolymerization and catastrophe frequency predicted to alter the steady-state microtubule population. Quantitative in vivo analysis of the underlying microtubule array architecture showed that AtCLASP is required to maintain the number of growing microtubule plus ends during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions between array patterns. We propose that AtCLASP plays a critical role in cellular morphogenesis through actions on new microtubules that facilitate array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions.</p>

Establishment of Photosynthesis through Chloroplast Development Is Controlled by Two Distinct Regulatory Phases
<p>Chloroplasts develop from undifferentiated proplastids present in meristematic tissue. Thus, chloroplast biogenesis is closely connected to leaf development, which restricts our ability to study the process of chloroplast biogenesis per se. As a consequence, we know relatively little about the regulatory mechanisms behind the establishment of the photosynthetic reactions and how the activities of the two genomes involved are coordinated during chloroplast development. We developed a single cell-based experimental system from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) with high temporal resolution allowing for investigations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion from proplastids to functional chloroplasts. Using this unique cell line, we could show that the establishment of photosynthesis is dependent on a regulatory mechanism involving two distinct phases. The first phase is triggered by rapid light-induced changes in gene expression and the metabolome. The second phase is dependent on the activation of the chloroplast and generates massive changes in the nuclear gene expression required for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion to photosynthetically functional chloroplasts. The second phase also is associated with a spatial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion of the chloroplasts from clusters around the nucleus to the final position at the cell cortex. Thus, the establishment of photosynthesis is a two-phase process with a clear checkpoint associated with the second regulatory phase allowing coordination of the activities of the nuclear and plastid genomes.</p>

Environmental and Genetic Factors Regulating Localization of the Plant Plasma Membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase
<p>A P-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is the primary transporter that converts ATP to electrochemical energy at the plasma membrane of higher plants. Its product, the proton-motive force, is composed of an electrical potential and a pH gradient. Many studies have demonstrated that this proton-motive force not only drives the secondary transporters required for nutrient uptake, but also plays a direct role in regulating cell expansion. Here, we have generated a transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plant expressing H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase isoform 2 (AHA2) that is translationally fused with a fluorescent protein and examined its cellular localization by live-cell microscopy. Using a 3D imaging approach with seedlings grown for various times under a variety of light intensities, we demonstrate that AHA2 localization at the plasma membrane of root cells requires light. In dim light conditions, AHA2 is found in intracellular compartments, in addition to the plasma membrane. This localization profile was age-dependent and specific to cell types found in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone located between the meristem and elongation zones. The accumulation of AHA2 in intracellular compartments is consistent with reduced H<sup>+</sup> secretion near the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone and the suppression of root growth. By examining AHA2 localization in a knockout mutant of a receptor protein kinase, FERONIA, we found that the intracellular accumulation of AHA2 in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion zone is dependent on a functional FERONIA-dependent inhibitory response in root elongation. Overall, this study provides a molecular underpinning for understanding the genetic, environmental, and developmental factors influencing root growth via localization of the plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase.</p>

Leaf and Plant Age Affects Photosynthetic Performance and Photoprotective Capacity
<p>In this work, we studied the changes in high-light tolerance and photosynthetic activity in leaves of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) rosette throughout the vegetative stage of growth. We implemented an image-analysis work flow to analyze the capacity of both the whole plant and individual leaves to cope with excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation energy by following the changes in absorbed light energy partitioning. The data show that leaf and plant age are both important factors influencing the fate of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation energy. During the dark-to-light <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion, the age of the plant affects mostly steady-state levels of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching, leading to an increased photosynthetic performance of its leaves. The age of the leaf affects the induction kinetics of nonphotochemical quenching. These observations were confirmed using model selection procedures. We further investigated how different leaves on a rosette acclimate to high light and show that younger leaves are less prone to photoinhibition than older leaves. Our results stress that both plant and leaf age should be taken into consideration during the quantification of photosynthetic and photoprotective traits to produce repeatable and reliable results.</p>

Mechanism of Dual Targeting of the Phytochrome Signaling Component HEMERA/pTAC12 to Plastids and the Nucleus
<p>HEMERA (HMR) is a nuclear and plastidial dual-targeted protein. While it functions in the nucleus as a transcriptional coactivator in phytochrome signaling to regulate a distinct set of light-responsive, growth-relevant genes, in plastids it is known as pTAC12, which associates with the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase, and is essential for inducing the plastomic photosynthetic genes and initiating chloroplast biogenesis. However, the mechanism of targeting HMR to the nucleus and plastids is still poorly understood. Here, we show that HMR can be directly imported into chloroplasts through a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong> peptide residing in the N-terminal 50 amino acids. Upon cleavage of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong> peptide and additional proteolytic processing, mature HMR, which begins from Lys-58, retains its biochemical properties in phytochrome signaling. Unexpectedly, expression of mature HMR failed to rescue not only the plastidial but also the nuclear defects of the <i>hmr</i> mutant. This is because the predicted nuclear localization signals of HMR are nonfunctional, and therefore mature HMR is unable to accumulate in either plastids or the nucleus. Surprisingly, fusing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong> peptide of the small subunit of Rubisco with mature HMR rescues both its plastidial and nuclear localization and functions. These results, combined with the observation that the nuclear form of HMR has the same reduced molecular mass as plastidial HMR, support a retrograde protein translocation mechanism in which HMR is targeted first to plastids, processed to the mature form, and then relocated to the nucleus.</p>

Gibberellin Signaling Requires Chromatin Remodeler PICKLE to Promote Vegetative Growth and Phase Transitions
<p>PICKLE (PKL) is an ATP-dependent chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding domain (CHD3) chromatin remodeling enzyme in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Previous studies showed that PKL promotes embryonic-to-vegetative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion by inhibiting expression of seed-specific genes during seed germination. The <i>pkl</i> mutants display a low penetrance of the “pickle root” phenotype, with a thick and green primary root that retains embryonic characteristics. The penetrance of this pickle root phenotype in <i>pkl</i> is dramatically increased in gibberellin (GA)-deficient conditions. At adult stages, the <i>pkl</i> mutants are semidwarfs with delayed flowering time, which resemble reduced GA-signaling mutants. These findings suggest that PKL may play a positive role in regulating GA signaling. A recent biochemical analysis further showed that PKL and GA signaling repressors DELLAs antagonistically regulate hypocotyl cell elongation genes by direct protein-protein interaction. To elucidate further the role of PKL in GA signaling and plant development, we studied the genetic interaction between PKL and DELLAs using the hextuple mutant containing <i>pkl</i> and <i>della</i> pentuple (<i>dP</i>) mutations. Here, we show that PKL is required for most of GA-promoted developmental processes, including vegetative growth such as hypocotyl, leaf, and inflorescence stem elongation, and phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions such as juvenile-to-adult leaf and vegetative-to-reproductive phase. The removal of all DELLA functions (in the <i>dP</i> background) cannot rescue these phenotypes in <i>pkl</i>. RNA-sequencing analysis using the <i>ga1</i> (a GA-deficient mutant), <i>pkl</i>, and the <i>ga1 pkl</i> double mutant further shows that expression of 80% of GA-responsive genes in seedlings is PKL dependent, including genes that function in cell elongation, cell division, and phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions. These results indicate that the CHD3 chromatin remodeler PKL is required for regulating gene expression during most of GA-regulated developmental processes.</p>

Transcription Factors WOX11/12 Directly Activate <i>WOX5/7</i> to Promote Root Primordia Initiation and Organogenesis<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>De novo organogenesis, which gives rise to adventitious roots and shoots, is a type of plant regeneration for survival after wounding. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), two main cell fate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion steps are required to establish the root primordium during de novo root organogenesis from leaf explants. The first step from regeneration-competent cells to root founder cells involves activation of <i>WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX11</i> (<i>WOX11</i>) and <i>WOX12</i> (<i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i>) expression by auxin. However, the molecular mechanism controlling the second step of fate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion from root founder cells to root primordium is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the expression levels of <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> decrease while those of <i>WOX5</i> and <i>7</i> (<i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i>) increase during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion from root founder cells to the root primordium. <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> function genetically upstream of <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i>, and the WOX11/12 proteins directly bind to the promoters of <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> to activate their transcription. Mutations in <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> result in defective primordium formation. Overall, our data indicate that the expression switch from <i>WOX11</i>/<i>12</i> to <i>WOX5</i>/<i>7</i> is critical for initiation of the root primordium during de novo root organogenesis.</p>

Whispering neurons fuel cortical highways
<p>The mammalian neocortex is one of the most intricate entities found in nature, both in terms of structure and function. It is the brain region responsible for the execution of high-order functions, including sensory perception, motor control, cognition, and speech. Its development is equally complex because it requires that millions to billions (depending on the species) of neurons assemble in distinct layers and connect with exquisite precision to perform complicated information processing operations. During embryonic development, formation of the cerebral cortex involves the migration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>atory neurons generated in the ventricular zone toward the cortical plate, where they establish their final position in six well-defined horizontal layers consisting of different types of neurons and architecture. Along this migratory phase, developing neurons undergo a morphological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion from multipolar shape to bipolar morphology. Bipolar neurons exhibit faster locomotion, quickly reaching their final destination. On page 313 of this issue, Ohtaka-Maruyama <i>et al.</i> (<i>1</i>) reveal that this important switch to bipolar neurons is influenced by glutamate release from neurons located at the subplate, just beneath the cortical plate. Subplate neurons trigger this transformation by making transient synaptic contacts with multipolar neurons in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong> to the cortical laminae. Understanding this process is important because disruption of neocortical migration results in several human neuro-developmental diseases.</p>

Here we report strong diamagnetism in the Mott insulator calcium ruthenate (Ca<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>) induced by dc electric current. The application of a current density of merely 1 ampere per centimeter squared induces diamagnetism stronger than that in other nonsuperconducting materials.

UBE2O remodels the proteome during terminal erythroid differentiation
<p>During terminal differentiation, the global protein complement is remodeled, as epitomized by erythrocytes, whose cytosol is ~98% globin. The erythroid proteome undergoes a rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion at the reticulocyte stage; however, the mechanisms driving programmed elimination of preexisting cytosolic proteins are unclear. We found that a mutation in the murine <i>Ube2o</i> gene, which encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme induced during erythropoiesis, results in anemia. Proteomic analysis suggested that UBE2O is a broad-spectrum ubiquitinating enzyme that remodels the erythroid proteome. In particular, ribosome elimination, a hallmark of reticulocyte differentiation, was defective in <i>Ube2o<sup>−/−</sup></i> mutants. UBE2O recognized ribosomal proteins and other substrates directly, targeting them to proteasomes for degradation. Thus, in reticulocytes, the induction of ubiquitinating factors may drive the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion from a complex to a simple proteome.</p>

Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in graphene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed by mid-infrared <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions.</p>

Strong peak in <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> of Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> under uniaxial pressure
<p>Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> is an unconventional superconductor that has attracted widespread study because of its high purity and the possibility that its superconducting order parameter has odd parity. We study the dependence of its superconductivity on anisotropic strain. Applying uniaxial pressures of up to ~1 gigapascals along a 〈100〉 direction (<i>a</i> axis) of the crystal lattice results in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) increasing from 1.5 kelvin in the unstrained material to 3.4 kelvin at compression by ≈0.6%, and then falling steeply. Calculations give evidence that the observed maximum <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> occurs at or near a Lifshitz <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion when the Fermi level passes through a Van Hove singularity, and open the possibility that the highly strained, <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 3.4 K Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> has an even-parity, rather than an odd-parity, order parameter.</p>

Observing the ultrafast buildup of a Fano resonance in the time domain
<p>Although the time-dependent buildup of asymmetric Fano line shapes in absorption spectra has been of great theoretical interest in the past decade, experimental verification of the predictions has been elusive. Here, we report the experimental observation of the emergence of a Fano resonance in the prototype system of helium by interrupting the autoionization process of a correlated two-electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ed state with a strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lase</span></strong>r field. The tunable temporal gate between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ation and termination of the resonance allows us to follow the formation of a Fano line shape in time. The agreement with ab initio calculations validates our experimental time-gating technique for addressing an even broader range of topics, such as the emergence of electron correlation, the onset of electron-internuclear coupling, and quasi-particle formation.</p>

Universal space-time scaling symmetry in the dynamics of bosons across a quantum phase transition
<p>The dynamics of many-body systems spanning condensed matter, cosmology, and beyond are hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ions. The universal dynamics are expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry of space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose condensates in a shaken optical lattice. Shaking the lattice drives condensates across an effectively ferromagnetic quantum phase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion. After crossing the critical point, the condensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop antiferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from the sub-Poisson distribution of the spacing between topological defects. The fluctuations and correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of the scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.</p>

Genomic Diversity and Admixture Differs for Stone-Age Scandinavian Foragers and Farmers
<sec><title>Hunters and Farmers</title><p>The Neolithic period in Europe saw the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to farming. Previous genetic analyses have suggested that hunter-gatherers were replaced by immigrant farmers. <bold>Skoglund <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 747, published online 24 April) sequenced one Mesolithic and nine Neolithic Swedish individuals to examine the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transit</span></strong>ion from hunter-gatherers to farmers. Substantial genetic differentiation was observed between hunter-gatherers and farmers: There was lower genetic diversity within the hunter-gatherers and gene flow from the hunter-gatherers into the farmers but not vice versa.</p></sec>

Polarization-Controlled Tunable Directional Coupling of Surface Plasmon Polaritons
<sec><title>Controlling Light Propagation</title><p>Surface plasmons are light-induced collective electronic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ations in a metal that offer the possibility of manufacturing optoelectronic devices at nanometer scale. Before such shrinking can be achieved, the propagation direction and lifetime of the plasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">excit</span></strong>ations have to be controlled (see the Perspective by <bold>Miroshnichenko and Kivshar</bold>). <bold>Rodríguez-Fortuño <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 328) show how this is done using polarized light. Alternatively, using an array of metallic nanoantennae (in this case, slits) patterned into a thin gold film, <bold>Lin <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 331) present a further improvement on current plasmonic coupling schemes that has the potential to encode information contained in both the intensity and polarization of light.</p></sec>

Vocal tract modelling in fallow deer: are male groans nasalized?
<p><bold>Highlighted Article:</bold> CT scans of fallow <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deer</span></strong> specimens show that the nasal cavities are likely to be involved in the production of their groans.</p>

Circulatory mechanisms underlying adaptive increases in thermogenic capacity in high-altitude deer mice
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> Adaptive increases in thermogenic capacity in high-altitude <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deer</span></strong> mice involve integrated functional changes across the O<sub>2</sub> cascade that augment O<sub>2</sub> circulation and extraction from the blood.</p>

Differential regulation of the unfolded protein response in outbred deer mice and susceptibility to metabolic disease
<p><bold>Summary:</bold> By using genetically diverse <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">deer</span></strong> mice, we show that the expression of different chaperones is highly coordinated in individual animals and its profile predicts the onset of metabolic pathology.</p>

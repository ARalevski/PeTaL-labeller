Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p>Proteins fold into unique native structures stabilized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not stability. We combined computational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and stability for more than 15,000 de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative control sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and stability in uncharted protein space. Iteration between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and experiment increased the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to stability as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> into a data-driven science.</p>

The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, <i>qPH3</i>, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e and will benefit the selection of ideal plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e in maize breeding.</p>

De novo design of tunable, pH-driven conformational changes
<p>The ability of naturally occurring proteins to change conformation in response to environmental changes is critical to biological function. Although there have been advances in the de novo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of stable proteins with a single, deep free-energy minimum, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of conformational switches remains challenging. We present a general strategy to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> pH-responsive protein conformational changes by precisely preorganizing histidine residues in buried hydrogen-bond networks. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> homotrimers and heterodimers that are stable above pH 6.5 but undergo cooperative, large-scale conformational changes when the pH is lowered and electrostatic and steric repulsion builds up as the network histidine residues become protonated. The transition pH and cooperativity can be controlled through the number of histidine-containing networks and the strength of the surrounding hydrophobic interactions. Upon disassembly, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed proteins disrupt lipid membranes both in vitro and after being endocytosed in mammalian cells. Our results demonstrate that environmentally triggered conformational changes can now be programmed by de novo protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>.</p>

“Perfect” designer chromosome V and behavior of a ring derivative

We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed and de novo synthesized 536,024–base pair chromosome synV in the “Build-A-Genome China” course. We corrected an initial isolate of synV to perfectly match the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed sequence using integrative cotransformation and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)–mediated editing in 22 steps; synV strains exhibit high fitness under a variety of culture conditions, compared with that of wild-type V strains. A ring synV derivative was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed, which is fully functional in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> under all conditions tested and exhibits lower spore viability during meiosis.

Comprehensive computational design of ordered peptide macrocycles
<p>Mixed-chirality peptide macrocycles such as cyclosporine are among the most potent therapeutics identified to date, but there is currently no way to systematically search the structural space spanned by such compounds. Natural proteins do not provide a useful guide: Peptide macrocycles lack regular secondary structures and hydrophobic cores, and can contain local structures not accessible with <sc>l</sc>-amino acids. Here, we enumerate the stable structures that can be adopted by macrocyclic peptides composed of <sc>l</sc>- and <sc>d</sc>-amino acids by near-exhaustive backbone sampling followed by sequence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and energy landscape calculations. We identify more than 200 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s predicted to fold into single stable structures, many times more than the number of currently available unbound peptide macrocycle structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance structures of 9 of 12 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed 7- to 10-residue macrocycles, and three 11- to 14-residue bicyclic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s, are close to the computational models. Our results provide a nearly complete coverage of the rich space of structures possible for short peptide macrocycles and vastly increase the available starting scaffolds for both rational drug <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> and library selection methods.</p>

Morphogen gradient reconstitution reveals Hedgehog pathway design principles

Morphogen-sensing pathways exhibit diverse molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>es, whose roles in controlling patterning dynamics and precision have been unclear. In this work, combining cell-based in vitro gradient reconstitution, genetic rewiring, and mathematical modeling, we systematically analyzed the distinctive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>al features of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway. We found that the combination of double-negative regulatory logic and negative feedback through the PTCH receptor accelerates gradient formation and improves robustness to variation in the morphogen production rate compared with alternative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s. The ability to isolate morphogen patterning from concurrent developmental processes and to compare the patterning behaviors of alternative, rewired pathway <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>es offers a powerful way to understand and engineer multicellular patterning.</p>

Nevertheless, the in vivo mechanism of action of CNO at DREADDs has never been confirmed. CNO does not enter the brain after systemic drug injections and shows low affinity for DREADDs. Clozapine, to which CNO rapidly converts in vivo, shows high DREADD affinity and potency. Upon systemic CNO injections, converted clozapine readily enters the brain and occupies central nervous system–expressed DREADDs, whereas systemic subthreshold clozapine injections induce preferential DREADD-mediated behaviors.</p>

A High-Throughput, Field-Based Phenotyping Technology for Tall Biomass Crops
<p>Recent advances in omics technologies have not been accompanied by equally efficient, cost-effective, and accurate phenotyping methods required to dissect the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e of complex traits. Even though high-throughput phenotyping platforms have been developed for controlled environments, field-based aerial and ground technologies have only been <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed and deployed for short-stature crops. Therefore, we developed and tested Phenobot 1.0, an auto-steered and self-propelled field-based high-throughput phenotyping platform for tall dense canopy crops, such as sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>). Phenobot 1.0 was equipped with laterally positioned and vertically stacked stereo RGB cameras. Images collected from 307 diverse sorghum lines were re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed in 3D for feature extraction. User interfaces were developed, and multiple algorithms were evaluated for their accuracy in estimating plant height and stem diameter. Tested feature extraction methods included the following: (1) User-interactive Individual Plant Height Extraction (UsIn-PHe) based on dense stereo three-dimensional re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion; (2) Automatic Hedge-based Plant Height Extraction (Auto-PHe) based on dense stereo 3D re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion; (3) User-interactive Dense Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction; and (4) User-interactive Image Patch Stereo Matching Stem Diameter Extraction (IPaS-Di). Comparative genome-wide association analysis and ground-truth validation demonstrated that both UsIn-PHe and Auto-PHe were accurate methods to estimate plant height, while Auto-PHe had the additional advantage of being a completely automated process. For stem diameter, IPaS-Di generated the most accurate estimates of this biomass-related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>al trait. In summary, our technology was proven robust to obtain ground-based high-throughput plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e parameters of sorghum, a tall and densely planted crop species.</p>

Phosphoproteomic analysis of chimeric antigen receptor signaling reveals kinetic and quantitative differences that affect cell function
<p>Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) link an antigen recognition domain to intracellular signaling domains to redirect T cell specificity and function. T cells expressing CARs with CD28/CD3ζ or 4-1BB/CD3ζ signaling domains are effective at treating refractory B cell malignancies but exhibit differences in effector function, clinical efficacy, and toxicity that are assumed to result from the activation of divergent signaling cascades. We analyzed stimulation-induced phosphorylation events in primary human CD8<sup>+</sup> CD28/CD3ζ and 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells by mass spectrometry and found that both CAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>s activated similar signaling intermediates. Stimulation of CD28/CD3ζ CARs activated faster and larger-magnitude changes in protein phosphorylation, which correlated with an effector T cell–like phenotype and function. In contrast, 4-1BB/CD3ζ CAR T cells preferentially expressed T cell memory–associated genes and exhibited sustained antitumor activity against established tumors in vivo. Mutagenesis of the CAR CD28 signaling domain demonstrated that the increased CD28/CD3ζ CAR signal intensity was partly related to constitutive association of Lck with this domain in CAR complexes. Our data show that CAR signaling pathways cannot be predicted solely by the domains used to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> the receptor and that signal strength is a key determinant of T cell fate. Thus, tailoring CAR <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> based on signal strength may lead to improved clinical efficacy and reduced toxicity.</p>

Electrified methane reforming: A compact approach to greener industrial hydrogen production

Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically heated catalytic structure directly into a steam-methane–reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production. Intimate contact between the electric heat source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases catalyst utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> with small characteristic length scales allows compact reactor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer platforms.

Packing of apolar side chains enables accurate design of highly stable membrane proteins
<p>The features that stabilize the structures of membrane proteins remain poorly understood. Polar interactions contribute modestly, and the hydrophobic effect contributes little to the energetics of apolar side-chain packing in membranes. Disruption of steric packing can destabilize the native folds of membrane proteins, but is packing alone sufficient to drive folding in lipids? If so, then membrane proteins stabilized by this feature should be readily <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed and structurally characterized—yet this has not been achieved. Through simulation of the natural protein phospholamban and re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of variants, we define a steric packing code underlying its assembly. Synthetic membrane proteins <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed using this code and stabilized entirely by apolar side chains conform to the intended fold.

Interface and heterostructure design in polyelemental nanoparticles
<p>Nanomaterials that form as heterostructures have applications in catalysis, plasmonics, and electronics. Multielement nanoparticles can now be synthesized through a variety of routes, but how thermodynamic phases form in such structures and how specific interfaces between them can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed and synthesized are still poorly understood. We explored how palladium-tin alloys form mixed-composition phases with metals with known but complex miscibilities. Nanoparticles with up to seven elements were synthesized, and many form triphase heterostructures consisting of either three-interface or two-interface <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>es. Density functional theory calculations and experimental work were used to determine the balance between the surface and interfacial energies of the observed phases. From these observations, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> rules have been established for making polyelemental systems with specific heterostructures, including tetraphase nanoparticles with as many as six junctions.</p>

A sweeter approach to vaccine design
<p>Vaccines have transformed human health. Yet, guided primarily by empiricism for centuries, vaccine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> ultimately met its match in scourges such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, which continue to plague global health. The elusive search for vaccines against such diseases has driven researchers of diverse expertise to forgo empirical vaccinology. Instead, they favor a reductionist approach inspired by how pathogens interact with the immune system, which has evolved to distinguish foreign from self by sensing both physical (e.g, size) and chemical (e.g., foreign molecules) features of pathogens. This has guided the rational <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of vaccines that mimic key pathogen properties, including arraying antigens on particles to increase recognition by antibody-producing B cells (<i>1</i>). However, the mechanisms by which multivalent antigen display on nanoparticles—either synthetic or natural—enhances immunity, and how this may influence vaccine <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> principles, remain unresolved. On page 649 of this issue, Tokatlian <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) help fill this knowledge gap by demonstrating that engineering nanoparticles with glycans—sugar molecules—is critical to potentiating antibody responses. This might lead to improved next-generation vaccines against a wide diversity of pathogens.</p>

Programmable protein circuits in living cells
<p>Synthetic protein-level circuits could enable engineering of powerful new cellular behaviors. Rational protein circuit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> would be facilitated by a composable protein-protein regulation system in which individual protein components can regulate one another to create a variety of different circuit <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>es. In this study, we show that engineered viral proteases can function as composable protein components, which can together implement a broad variety of circuit-level functions in mammalian cells. In this system, termed CHOMP (circuits of hacked orthogonal modular proteases), input proteases dock with and cleave target proteases to inhibit their function. These components can be connected to generate regulatory cascades, binary logic gates, and dynamic analog signal-processing functions. To demonstrate the utility of this system, we rationally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed a circuit that induces cell death in response to upstream activators of the Ras oncogene. Because CHOMP circuits can perform complex functions yet be encoded as single transcripts and delivered without genomic integration, they offer a scalable platform to facilitate protein circuit engineering for biotechnological applications.</p>

A designed heme-[4Fe-4S] metalloenzyme catalyzes sulfite reduction like the native enzyme
<p>Multielectron redox reactions often require multicofactor metalloenzymes to facilitate coupled electron and proton movement, but it is challenging to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> artificial enzymes to catalyze these important reactions, owing to their structural and functional complexity. We report a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed heteronuclear heme-[4Fe-4S] cofactor in cytochrome <i>c</i> peroxidase as a structural and functional model of the enzyme sulfite reductase.

By offering insight into the requirements for a demanding six-electron, seven-proton reaction that has so far eluded synthetic catalysts, this study provides strategies for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ing highly functional multicofactor artificial enzymes.</p>

A cargo-sorting DNA robot

We demonstrate three modular building blocks for a DNA robot that performs cargo sorting at the molecular level. A simple algorithm encoding recognition between cargos and their destinations allows for a simple robot <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>: a single-stranded DNA with one leg and two foot domains for walking, and one arm and one hand domain for picking up and dropping off cargos. The robot explores a two-dimensional testing ground on the surface of DNA origami, picks up multiple cargos of two types that are initially at unordered locations, and delivers them to specified destinations until all molecules are sorted into two distinct piles. The robot is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed to perform a random walk without any energy supply. Exploiting this feature, a single robot can repeatedly sort multiple cargos. Localization on DNA origami allows for distinct cargo-sorting tasks to take place simultaneously in one test tube or for multiple robots to collectively perform the same task.</p>

The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20% of county income (90% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).</p>

Three-dimensional holey-graphene/niobia composite architectures for ultrahigh-rate energy storage

MoChlo: A Versatile, Modular Cloning Toolbox for Chloroplast Biotechnology
<p>Plant synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving field with new tools constantly emerging to drive innovation. Of particular interest is the application of synthetic biology to chloroplast biotechnology to generate plants capable of producing new metabolites, vaccines, biofuels, and high-value chemicals. Progress made in the assembly of large DNA molecules, composing multiple transcriptional units, has significantly aided in the ability to rapidly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> novel vectors for genetic engineering. In particular, Golden Gate assembly has provided a facile molecular tool for standardized assembly of synthetic genetic elements into larger DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>s. In this work, a complete modular chloroplast cloning system, MoChlo, was developed and validated for fast and flexible chloroplast engineering in plants. A library of 128 standardized chloroplast-specific parts (47 promoters, 38 5′ untranslated regions [5′UTRs], nine promoter:5′UTR fusions, 10 3′UTRs, 14 genes of interest, and 10 chloroplast-specific destination vectors) were mined from the literature and modified for use in MoChlo assembly, along with chloroplast-specific destination vectors. The strategy was validated by assembling synthetic operons of various sizes and determining the efficiency of assembly. This method was successfully used to generate chloroplast transformation vectors containing up to seven transcriptional units in a single vector (∼10.6-kb synthetic operon). To enable researchers with limited resources to engage in chloroplast biotechnology, and to accelerate progress in the field, the entire kit, as described, is available through Addgene at minimal cost. Thus, the MoChlo kit represents a valuable tool for fast and flexible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of heterologous metabolic pathways for plastid metabolic engineering.</p>

Semiautomated Feature Extraction from RGB Images for Sorghum Panicle Architecture GWAS
<p>Because structural variation in the inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e of cereal crops can influence yield, it is of interest to identify the genes responsible for this variation. However, the manual collection of inflorescence phenotypes can be time consuming for the large populations needed to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and is difficult for multidimensional traits such as volume. A semiautomated phenotyping pipeline, TIM (Toolkit for Inflorescence Measurement), was developed and used to extract unidimensional and multidimensional features from images of 1,064 sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) panicles from 272 genotypes comprising a subset of the Sorghum Association Panel. GWAS detected 35 unique single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with variation in inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e. The accuracy of the TIM pipeline is supported by the fact that several of these trait-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (TASs) are located within chromosomal regions associated with similar traits in previously published quantitative trait locus and GWAS analyses of sorghum. Additionally, sorghum homologs of maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) genes known to affect inflorescence <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e are enriched in the vicinities of TASs. Finally, our TASs are enriched within genomic regions that exhibit high levels of divergence between converted tropical lines and cultivars, consistent with the hypothesis that these chromosomal intervals were targets of selection during modern breeding.</p>

Root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e plays an important role in the drought tolerance of plants; however, research efforts to improve drought tolerance of apple trees have focused on aboveground targets. Due to the difficulties associated with visualization and data analysis, there is currently a poor understanding of the genetic players and molecular mechanisms involved in the root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e of apple trees under drought conditions. We previously observed that MdMYB88 and its paralog MdMYB124 regulate apple tree root morphology.

Further investigation revealed that MdMYB88 and MdMYB124 regulate root xylem development by directly binding <i>MdVND6</i> and <i>MdMYB46</i> promoters and thus influence expression of their target genes under drought conditions.

Transcription Factor-Mediated Control of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Vegetative Tissues
<p>Plants accumulate secondary metabolites to adapt to environmental conditions. These compounds, here exemplified by the purple-colored anthocyanins, are accumulated upon high temperatures, UV-light, drought, and nutrient deficiencies, and may contribute to tolerance to these stresses. Producing compounds is often part of a more broad response of the plant to changes in the environment. Here we investigate how a transcription-factor-mediated program for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis also has effects on formation of specialized cell structures and changes in the plant root <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e. A systems biology approach was developed in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) for coordinated induction of biosynthesis of anthocyanins, in a tissue- and development-independent manner. A transcription factor couple from <i>Antirrhinum</i> that is known to control anthocyanin biosynthesis was introduced in tomato under control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. By application of dexamethasone, anthocyanin formation was induced within 24 h in vegetative tissues and in undifferentiated cells. Profiles of metabolites and gene expression were analyzed in several tomato tissues. Changes in concentration of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds were observed in all tested tissues, accompanied by induction of the biosynthetic pathways leading from Glc to anthocyanins. A number of pathways that are not known to be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were observed to be regulated. Anthocyanin-producing plants displayed profound physiological and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>al changes, depending on the tissue, including root branching, root epithelial cell morphology, seed germination, and leaf conductance.

Microtubule Array Patterns Have a Common Underlying Architecture in Hypocotyl Cells
<p>Microtubules at the plant cell cortex influence cell shape by patterning the deposition of cell wall materials. The elongated cells of the hypocotyl create a variety of microtubule array patterns with differing degrees of polymer coalignment and orientation to the cell’s growth axis. To gain insight into the mechanisms driving array organization, we investigated the underlying microtubule array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e in light-grown epidermal cells with explicit reference to array pattern. We discovered that all nontransverse patterns share a common underlying array <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e, having a core unimodal peak of coaligned microtubules in a split bipolarized arrangement. The growing microtubule plus ends extend toward the cell’s apex and base with a region of antiparallel microtubule overlap at the cell’s midzone. This core coalignment continuously shifts between ±30° from the cell’s longitudinal growth axis, forming a continuum of longitudinal and oblique arrays. Transverse arrays exhibit the same unimodal core coalignment but form local domains of microtubules polymerizing in the same direction rather than a split bipolarized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e. Quantitative imaging experiments and analysis of <i>katanin</i> mutants showed that the longitudinal arrays are created from microtubules originating on the outer periclinal cell face, pointing to a cell-directed, rather than self-organizing, mechanism for specifying the major array pattern classes in the hypocotyl cell.</p>

Although great progress has been made in the understanding of plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e regulation, the precise mechanism is still an urgent need to be revealed. Here, we report that over-expression of <i>OsMIR396d</i> in rice results in semidwarf and increased leaf angle, a typical phenotype of brassinosteroid (BR) enhanced mutant. OsmiR396d is involved in the interaction network of BR and gibberellin (GA) signaling. In <i>OsMIR396d</i> over-expression plants, BR signaling was enhanced. In contrast, both the signaling and biosynthesis of GA were impaired. BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1, a core transcription activator of BR signaling, directly promoted the accumulation of OsmiR396d, which controlled BR response and GA biosynthesis by regulating the expression of different target genes respectively. <i>GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR 6</i>, one of OsmiR396d targets, participated in GA biosynthesis and signal transduction but was not directly involved in BR signaling.

Multiplexed Gene Editing and Protein Overexpression Using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i> Viral Vector
<p>Development of CRISPR/Cas9 transient gene editing screening tools in plant biology has been hindered by difficulty of delivering high quantities of biologically active single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Furthermore, it has been largely accepted that in vivo generated sgRNAs need to be devoid of extraneous nucleotides, which has limited sgRNA expression by delivery vectors. Here, we increased cellular concentrations of sgRNA by transiently delivering sgRNAs using a <i>Tobacco mosaic virus</i>-derived vector (TRBO) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ed with 5′ and 3′ sgRNA proximal nucleotide-processing capabilities. To demonstrate proof-of-principle, we used the TRBO-sgRNA delivery platform to target GFP in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> (16c) plants, and gene editing was accompanied by loss of GFP expression. Surprisingly, indel (insertions and deletions) percentages averaged nearly 70% within 7 d postinoculation using the TRBO-sgRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>s, which retained 5′ nucleotide overhangs. In contrast, and in accordance with current models, in vitro Cas9 cleavage assays only edited DNA when 5′ sgRNA nucleotide overhangs were removed, suggesting a novel processing mechanism is occurring in planta. Since the Cas9/TRBO-sgRNA platform demonstrated sgRNA flexibility, we targeted the <i>N. benthamiana NbAGO1</i> paralogs with one sgRNA and also multiplexed two sgRNAs using a single TRBO <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>, resulting in indels in three genes. TRBO-mediated expression of an RNA transcript consisting of an sgRNA adjoining a GFP protein coding region produced indels and viral-based GFP overexpression. In conclusion, multiplexed delivery of sgRNAs using the TRBO system offers flexibility for gene expression and editing and uncovered novel aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 biology.</p>

In this study, we demonstrate that miR156 controls bread wheat plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e. We show that overexpression of tae-miR156 in bread wheat cultivar Kenong199 leads to increased tiller number and severe defects in spikelet formation, probably due to the tae-miR156-mediated repression of a group of <i>SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE</i> (<i>SPL</i>) genes. Furthermore, we found that the expression of two genes <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED1</i> (<i>TaTB1</i>) and <i>BARREN STALK1</i> (<i>TaBA1</i>), whose orthologous genes in diverse plant species play conserved roles in regulating plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e, is markedly reduced in the tae-miR156-OE bread wheat plants. Significantly, we demonstrate that the strigolactone (SL) signaling repressor DWARF53 (TaD53), which physically associates with the transcriptional corepressor TOPLESS, can directly interact with the N-terminal domains of miR156-controlled TaSPL3/17. Most importantly, TaSPL3/17-mediated transcriptional activation of <i>TaBA1</i> and <i>TaTB1</i> can be largely repressed by TaD53 in the transient expression system. Our results reveal potential association between miR156-TaSPLs and SL signaling pathways during bread wheat tillering and spikelet development.</p>

In this study, we report a new small RNA overexpression system via viral satellite DNA associated with <i>Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus</i> (TYLCCNV) vector, which could highly overexpress not only artificial and endogenous miRNAs but also endogenous siRNAs in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. First, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed basic TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(319L) vector with widely used <i>AtMIR319a</i> backbone, but the expected photobleaching phenotype was very weak. Second, through comparing the effect of backbones (<i>AtMIR319a</i>, <i>AtMIR390a</i>, and <i>SlMIR159</i>) on specificity and significance of generating small RNAs, the <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone was optimally selected to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> the small RNA overexpression system. Third, through sRNA-Seq and Degradome-Seq, the small RNAs from <i>AtMIR390a</i> backbone in TYLCCNV-amiRPDS(390) vector were confirmed to highly overexpress amiRPDS and specifically silence targeted <i>PDS</i> gene. Using this system, rapid functional analysis of endogenous miRNAs and siRNAs was carried out, including miR156 and <i>athTAS3a</i> 5′D8(+). Meanwhile, through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>ing corresponding artificial miRNAs, this system could also significantly silence targeted endogenous genes and show specific phenotypes, including <i>PDS</i>, <i>Su</i>, and <i>PCNA</i>. These results demonstrated that this small RNA overexpression system could contribute to investigating not only the function of endogenous small RNAs, but also the functional genes in plants.</p>

Quartet-Net: A Quartet-Based Method to Reconstruct Phylogenetic Networks
<p>Phylogenetic networks can model reticulate evolutionary events such as hybridization, recombination, and horizontal gene transfer. However, re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing such networks is not trivial. Popular character-based methods are computationally inefficient, whereas distance-based methods cannot guarantee re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion accuracy because pairwise genetic distances only reflect partial information about a reticulate phylogeny. To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, here we introduce a quartet-based method to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> a phylogenetic network from a multiple sequence alignment. Unlike distances that only reflect the relationship between a pair of taxa, quartets contain information on the relationships among four taxa; these quartets provide adequate capacity to infer a more accurate phylogenetic network. In applications to simulated and biological data sets, we demonstrate that this novel method is robust and effective in re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing reticulate evolutionary events and it has the potential to infer more accurate phylogenetic distances than other conventional phylogenetic network <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion methods such as Neighbor-Joining, Neighbor-Net, and Split Decomposition. This method can be used in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ing phylogenetic networks from simple evolutionary events involving a few reticulate events to complex evolutionary histories involving a large number of reticulate events. A software called “Quartet-Net” is implemented and available at <ext-link>http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/QuartetNet/</ext-link>.</p>

AGP: A Multimethods Web Server for Alignment-Free Genome Phylogeny
<p>Phylogenetic analysis based on alignment method meets huge challenges when dealing with whole-genome sequences, for example, recombination, shuffling, and rearrangement of sequences. Thus, various alignment-free methods for phylogeny <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion have been proposed. However, most of these methods have not been implemented as tools or web servers. Researchers cannot use these methods easily with their data sets. To facilitate the usage of various alignment-free methods, we implemented most of the popular alignment-free methods and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ed a user-friendly web server for alignment-free genome phylogeny (AGP). AGP integrated the phylogenetic tree <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>ion, visualization, and comparison functions together. Both AGP and all source code of the methods are available at <ext-link>http://www.herbbol.org:8000/agp</ext-link> (last accessed February 26, 2013). AGP will facilitate research in the field of whole-genome phylogeny and comparison.</p>

Mid-term outcomes of 77 modular radial head prostheses
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Radial head arthroplasty (RHA) may be used in the treatment of   non-re<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>able radial head fractures. The aim of this study   was to evaluate the mid-term clinical and radiographic results of   RHA.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Between 2002 and 2014, 77 RHAs were implanted in 54 men and 23   women with either acute injuries (54) or with traumatic sequelae   (23) of a fracture of the radial head. Four <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>s of RHA were   used, including the Guepar (Small Bone Innovations (SBi)/Stryker;   36), Evolutive (Aston Medical; 24), rHead RECON (SBi/Stryker; ten)   or rHead STANDARD (SBi/Stryker; 7) prostheses. The mean follow-up   was 74.0 months (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>) 38.6; 24 to 141).   The indication for further surgery, range of movement, mean Mayo   Elbow Performance (MEP) score, quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder   and Hand (quickDASH) score, osteolysis and positioning of the implant   were also assessed according to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>, and acute or delayed   use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean MEP and quickDASH scores were 90.2 (<sc>sd</sc> 14;   45 to 100), and 14.0 points (<sc>sd</sc> 12; 1.2 to 52.5), respectively. There   were no significant differences between RHA performed in acute or   delayed fashion. There were 30 re-operations (19 with, and 11 without   removal of the implant) during the first three post-operative years.   Painful loosening was the primary indication for removal in 14 patients.   Short-stemmed prostheses (16 mm to 22 mm in length) were also associated   with an increased risk of painful loosening (odds ratio 3.54 (1.02   to 12.2), p = 0.045). Radiocapitellar instability was the primary   indication for re-operation with retention of the implant (5).

Augmenting the osseointegration of endoprostheses using laser-sintered porous collars
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Massive endoprostheses rely on extra-cortical bone bridging (ECBB)   to enhance fixation.

Mechanical Stress Conditioning and Electrical Stimulation Promote Contractility and Force Maturation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Human Cardiac Tissue
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Tissue engineering enables the generation of functional human cardiac tissue with cells derived in vitro in combination with biocompatible materials. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes provide a cell source for cardiac tissue engineering; however, their immaturity limits their potential applications. Here we sought to study the effect of mechanical conditioning and electric pacing on the maturation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells were used to generate collagen-based bioengineered human cardiac tissue. Engineered tissue <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong>s were subjected to different mechanical stress and electric pacing conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The engineered human myocardium exhibits Frank-Starling–type force-length relationships. After 2 weeks of static stress conditioning, the engineered myocardium demonstrated increases in contractility (0.63±0.10 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> vs 0.055±0.009 mN/mm<sup>2</sup> for no stress), tensile stiffness, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> alignment, and cell size. Stress conditioning also increased SERCA2 (Sarco/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase 2) expression, which correlated with a less negative force-frequency relationship. When electric pacing was combined with static stress conditioning, the tissues showed an additional increase in force production (1.34±0.19 mN/mm<sup>2</sup>), with no change in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">construct</span></strong> alignment or cell size, suggesting maturation of excitation-contraction coupling. Supporting this notion, we found expression of RYR2 (Ryanodine Receptor 2) and SERCA2 further increased by combined static stress and electric stimulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These studies demonstrate that electric pacing and mechanical stimulation promote maturation of the structural, mechanical, and force generation properties of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues.</p></sec>

3D organization of synthetic and scrambled chromosomes
<p>Although the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of the synthetic yeast genome Sc2.0 is highly conservative with respect to gene content, the deletion of several classes of repeated sequences and the introduction of thousands of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong>er changes may affect genome organization and potentially alter cellular functions. We report here the Hi-C–determined three-dimensional (3D) conformations of Sc2.0 chromosomes. The absence of repeats leads to a smoother contact pattern and more precisely tractable chromosome conformations, and the large-scale genomic organization is globally unaffected by the presence of synthetic chromosome(s). Two exceptions are synIII, which lacks the silent mating-type cassettes, and synXII, specifically when the ribosomal DNA is moved to another chromosome. We also exploit the contact maps to detect rearrangements induced in SCRaMbLE (synthetic chromosome rearrangement and modification by <i>loxP</i>-mediated evolution) strains.</p>

A supramolecular assembly mediates lentiviral DNA integration
<p>Retroviral integrase (IN) functions within the intasome nucleoprotein complex to catalyze insertion of viral DNA into cellular chromatin. Using cryo–electron microscopy, we now visualize the functional maedi-visna lentivirus intasome at 4.9 angstrom resolution. The intasome comprises a homo-hexadecamer of IN with a tetramer-of-tetramers <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">architectur</span></strong>e featuring eight structurally distinct types of IN protomers supporting two catalytically competent subunits. The conserved intasomal core, previously observed in simpler retroviral systems, is formed between two IN tetramers, with a pair of C-terminal domains from flanking tetramers completing the synaptic interface. Our results explain how HIV-1 IN, which self-associates into higher-order multimers, can form a functional intasome, reconcile the bulk of early HIV-1 IN biochemical and structural data, and provide a lentiviral platform for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">design</span></strong> of HIV-1 IN inhibitors.</p>

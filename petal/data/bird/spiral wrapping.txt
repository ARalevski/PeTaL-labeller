Spiral density waves in a young protoplanetary disk
<p>Gravitational forces are expected to excite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong> density waves in protoplanetary disks, disks of gas and dust orbiting young stars. However, previous observations that showed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong> structure were not able to probe disk midplanes, where most of the mass is concentrated and where planet formation takes place. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, we detected a pair of trailing symmetric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong> arms in the protoplanetary disk surrounding the young star Elias 2-27. The arms extend to the disk outer regions and can be traced down to the midplane. These millimeter-wave observations also reveal an emission gap closer to the star than the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong> arms. We argue that the observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong>s trace shocks of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong> density waves in the midplane of this young disk.</p>

Genome hypermobility by lateral transduction
<p>Genetic transduction is a major evolutionary force that underlies bacterial adaptation. Here we report that the temperate bacteriophages of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> engage in a distinct form of transduction we term lateral transduction. Staphylococcal prophages do not follow the previously described excision-replication-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ing pathway but instead excise late in their lytic program. Here, DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ing initiates in situ from integrated prophages, and large metameric spans including several hundred kilobases of the <i>S. aureus</i> genome are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ed in phage heads at very high frequency. In situ replication before DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ing creates multiple prophage genomes so that lateral-transducing particles form during normal phage maturation, transforming parts of the <i>S. aureus</i> chromosome into hypermobile regions of gene transfer.</p>

Multiplatform evaluation of global trends in wind speed and wave height
<p>In this study, global satellite data were analyzed to determine trends in oceanic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> speed and significant wave height over the 33-year period from 1985 to 2018. The analysis uses an extensive database obtained from 31 satellite missions comprising three types of instruments—altimeters, radiometers, and scatterometers. The analysis shows small increases in mean <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> speed and significant wave height over this period, with larger increases in extreme conditions (90th percentiles). The largest increases occur in the Southern Ocean. Confidence in the results is strengthened because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> speed trends are confirmed by all three satellite systems. An extensive set of sensitivity analyses confirms that both the mean and 90th percentile trends are robust, with only small impacts caused by satellite calibration and sampling patterns.</p>

Climate model shows large-scale wind and solar farms in the Sahara increase rain and vegetation
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> and solar farms offer a major pathway to clean, renewable energies. However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended climate consequences. In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic vegetation to show that large-scale installations of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold precipitation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface friction and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in vegetation further enhances precipitation, creating a positive albedo–precipitation–vegetation feedback that contributes ~80% of the precipitation increase for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> farms. This local enhancement is scale dependent and is particular to the Sahara, with small impacts in other deserts.</p>

Dunes on Pluto
<p>The surface of Pluto is more geologically diverse and dynamic than had been expected, but the role of its tenuous atmosphere in shaping the landscape remains unclear. We describe observations from the New Horizons spacecraft of regularly spaced, linear ridges whose morphology, distribution, and orientation are consistent with being transverse dunes. These are located close to mountainous regions and are orthogonal to nearby <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> streaks. We demonstrate that the wavelength of the dunes (~0.4 to 1 kilometer) is best explained by the deposition of sand-sized (~200 to ~300 micrometer) particles of methane ice in moderate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>s (<10 meters per second). The undisturbed morphology of the dunes, and relationships with the underlying convective glacial ice, imply that the dunes have formed in the very recent geological past.</p>

A pathway for mitotic chromosome formation
<p>Mitotic chromosomes fold as compact arrays of chromatin loops. To identify the pathway of mitotic chromosome formation, we combined imaging and Hi-C analysis of synchronous DT40 cell cultures with polymer simulations. Here we show that in prophase, the interphase organization is rapidly lost in a condensin-dependent manner, and arrays of consecutive 60-kilobase (kb) loops are formed. During prometaphase, ~80-kb inner loops are nested within ~400-kb outer loops. The loop array acquires a helical arrangement with consecutive loops emanating from a central “<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong> staircase” condensin scaffold. The size of helical turns progressively increases to ~12 megabases during prometaphase. Acute depletion of condensin I or II shows that nested loops form by differential action of the two condensins, whereas condensin II is required for helical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>ing.</p>

Structure of the mitochondrial inner membrane AAA+ protease YME1 gives insight into substrate processing
<p>We present an atomic model of a substrate-bound inner mitochondrial membrane AAA+ quality control protease in yeast, YME1. Our ~3.4-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure reveals how the adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) form a closed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong> staircase encircling an unfolded substrate, directing it toward the flat, symmetric protease ring. Three coexisting nucleotide states allosterically induce distinct positioning of tyrosines in the central channel, resulting in substrate engagement and translocation to the negatively charged proteolytic chamber. This tight coordination by a network of conserved residues defines a sequential, around-the-ring adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis cycle that results in stepwise substrate translocation. A hingelike linker accommodates the large-scale nucleotide-driven motions of the ATPase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong> relative to the planar proteolytic base. The translocation mechanism is likely conserved for other AAA+ ATPases.</p>

Mapping spiral structure on the far side of the Milky Way

Structure, force balance, and topology of Earth’s magnetopause
<p>The magnetopause deflects the solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> plasma and confines Earth’s magnetic field. We combine measurements made by the four spacecraft of the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission to demonstrate how the plasma and magnetic forces at the boundary affect the interaction between the shocked solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> and Earth’s magnetosphere. We compare these forces with the plasma pressure and examine the electron distribution function. We find that the magnetopause has sublayers with thickness comparable to the ion scale. Small pockets of low magnetic field strength, small radius of curvature, and high electric current mark the electron diffusion region. The flow of electrons, parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field, reveals a complex topology with the creation of magnetic ropes at the boundary.</p>

Implication of the suberin pathway in adaptation to waterlogging and hypertrophied lenticels formation in pedunculate oak (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.)
<p>Waterlogging causes stressful conditions for perennial species. The temporary overabundance of water in waterlogged soil can induce hypoxia in the rhizosphere, leading to root death, tree decline and even dieback. Two closely related members of the European white oak complex, pedunculate (<i>Quercus robur</i> L.) and sessile (<i>Quercus petraea</i> Matt. Liebl.) oaks, have different ecological characteristics, especially regarding their adaptation to soil waterlogging. The tolerance of waterlogging observed in pedunculate oak is driven principally by its ability to produce adaptive structures, hypertrophied lenticels and adventitious roots, and to switch rapidly its metabolism to the fermentative pathway. This study had two objectives: (i) to identify genes important for adaptation to waterlogging and (ii) to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in hypertrophied lenticel formation in pedunculate oak. We subjected seedlings of the two species to hypoxia by maintaining the water level 2 cm above the collar. The immersed part of the stem (i.e., containing hypertrophied lenticels in pedunculate oak) was sampled after 9 days of waterlogging stress and its gene expression was investigated by RNA-seq. Genes displaying differential expression between the two species were identified with the DESeq R <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>e and a false discovery rate of 0.001. We found that 3705 contigs were differentially regulated between the two species. Twenty-two differentially expressed genes were validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The suberin biosynthesis pathway was found to be upregulated in pedunculate oak, consistent with molecular mechanisms analogous to those operating in the radial oxygen loss barrier in waterlogging-tolerant species.</p>

Dephosphorylation of protamine 2 at serine 56 is crucial for murine sperm maturation in vivo
<p>The posttranslational modification of histones is crucial in spermatogenesis, as in other tissues; however, during spermiogenesis, histones are replaced with protamines, which are critical for the tight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ing of the DNA in sperm cells. Protamines are also posttranslationally modified by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which prompted our investigation of the underlying mechanisms and biological consequences of their regulation. On the basis of a screen that implicated the heat shock protein Hspa4l in spermatogenesis, we generated mice deficient in Hspa4l (<i>Hspa4l</i>-null mice), which showed male infertility and the malformation of sperm heads. These phenotypes are similar to those of <i>Ppp1cc</i>-deficient mice, and we found that the amount of a testis- and sperm-specific isoform of the Ppp1cc phosphatase (Ppp1cc2) in the chromatin-binding fraction was substantially less in <i>Hspa4l</i>-null spermatozoa than that in those of wild-type mice. We further showed that Ppp1cc2 was a substrate of the chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp70 and that Hspa4l enhanced the release of Ppp1cc2 from these complexes, enabling the freed Ppp1cc2 to localize to chromatin. Pull-down and in vitro phosphatase assays suggested the dephosphorylation of protamine 2 at serine 56 (Prm2 Ser<sup>56</sup>) by Ppp1cc2. To confirm the biological importance of Prm2 Ser<sup>56</sup> dephosphorylation, we mutated Ser<sup>56</sup> to alanine in Prm2 (Prm2 S56A). Introduction of this mutation to <i>Hspa4l</i>-null mice (<i>Hspa4l</i><sup>−/−</sup>; <i>Prm2</i><sup>S56A/S56A</sup>) restored the malformation of sperm heads and the infertility of <i>Hspa4l</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice. The dephosphorylation signal to eliminate phosphate was crucial, and these results unveiled the mechanism and biological relevance of the dephosphorylation of Prm2 for sperm maturation in vivo.</p>

Measurement and implications of Saturn’s gravity field and ring mass
<p>The interior structure of Saturn, the depth of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>s, and the mass and age of its rings constrain its formation and evolution. In the final phase of the Cassini mission, the spacecraft dived between the planet and its innermost ring, at altitudes of 2600 to 3900 kilometers above the cloud tops. During six of these crossings, a radio link with Earth was monitored to determine the gravitational field of the planet and the mass of its rings. We find that Saturn’s gravity deviates from theoretical expectations and requires differential rotation of the atmosphere extending to a depth of at least 9000 kilometers. The total mass of the rings is (1.54 ± 0.49) × 10<sup>19</sup> kilograms (0.41 ± 0.13 times that of the moon Mimas), indicating that the rings may have formed 10<sup>7</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> years ago.</p>

Structures and operating principles of the replisome
<p>Visualization in atomic detail of the replisome that performs concerted leading– and lagging–DNA strand synthesis at a replication fork has not been reported. Using bacteriophage T7 as a model system, we determined cryo–electron microscopy structures up to 3.2-angstroms resolution of helicase translocating along DNA and of helicase-polymerase-primase complexes engaging in synthesis of both DNA strands. Each domain of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong>-shaped hexameric helicase translocates sequentially hand-over-hand along a single-stranded DNA coil, akin to the way AAA+ ATPases (adenosine triphosphatases) unfold peptides. Two lagging-strand polymerases are attached to the primase, ready for Okazaki fragment synthesis in tandem. A β hairpin from the leading-strand polymerase separates two parental DNA strands into a T-shaped fork, thus enabling the closely coupled helicase to advance perpendicular to the downstream DNA duplex. These structures reveal the molecular organization and operating principles of a replisome.</p>

A loud quasi-periodic oscillation after a star is disrupted by a massive black hole

We report observations of a stable 131-second x-ray quasi-periodic oscillation from the tidal disruption event ASASSN-14li. Assuming the black hole mass indicated by host galaxy scaling relations, these observations imply that the periodicity originates from close to the event horizon and that the black hole is rapidly spinning. Our findings demonstrate that tidal disruption events can generate quasi-periodic oscillations that encode information about the physical properties of their black holes.</p>

Spectrally resolved helium absorption from the extended atmosphere of a warm Neptune-mass exoplanet
<p>Stellar heating causes atmospheres of close-in exoplanets to expand and escape. These extended atmospheres are difficult to observe because their main spectral signature—neutral hydrogen at ultraviolet wavelengths—is strongly absorbed by interstellar medium. We report the detection of the near-infrared triplet of neutral helium in the transiting warm Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-11b by using ground-based, high-resolution observations. The helium feature is repeatable over two independent transits, with an average absorption depth of 1.08 ± 0.05%. Interpreting absorption spectra with three-dimensional simulations of the planet’s upper atmosphere suggests that it extends beyond 5 planetary radii, with a large-scale height and a helium mass loss rate of ≲3 × 10<sup>5</sup> grams per second. A net blue-shift of the absorption might be explained by high-altitude <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>s flowing at 3 kilometers per second from day to night-side.</p>

A continental system for forecasting bird migration

We developed a bird migration forecast system at a continental scale by leveraging 23 years of spring observations to identify associations between atmospheric conditions and bird migration intensity. Our models explained up to 81% of variation in migration intensity across the United States at altitudes of 0 to 3000 meters, and performance remained high in forecasting events 1 to 7 days in advance (62 to 76% of variation was explained). Avian migratory movements across the United States likely exceed 500 million individuals per night during peak passage. Bird migration forecasts will reduce collisions with buildings, airplanes, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> turbines; inform a variety of monitoring efforts; and engage the public.</p>

Fast molecular outflow from a dusty star-forming galaxy in the early Universe

Feedback processes, such as outflowing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>s driven by radiation pressure, supernovae, or supermassive black hole accretion, can act to halt star formation if they heat or expel the gas supply. We report a molecular outflow launched from a dust-rich star-forming galaxy at redshift 5.3, 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The outflow reaches velocities up to 800 kilometers per second relative to the galaxy, is resolved into multiple clumps, and carries mass at a rate within a factor of 2 of the star formation rate. Our results show that molecular outflows can remove a large fraction of the gas available for star formation from galaxies at high redshift.</p>

Lacteal junction zippering protects against diet-induced obesity
<p>Excess dietary lipid uptake causes obesity, a major global health problem. Enterocyte-absorbed lipids are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ed into chylomicrons, which enter the bloodstream through intestinal lymphatic vessels called lacteals. Here, we show that preventing lacteal chylomicron uptake by inducible endothelial genetic deletion of <i>Neuropilin1</i> (<i>Nrp1</i>) and <i>Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1</i> (<i>Vegfr1</i>; also known as <i>Flt1</i>) renders mice resistant to diet-induced obesity. Absence of NRP1 and FLT1 receptors increased VEGF-A bioavailability and signaling through VEGFR2, inducing lacteal junction zippering and chylomicron malabsorption. Restoring permeable lacteal junctions by VEGFR2 and vascular endothelial (VE)–cadherin signaling inhibition rescued chylomicron transport in the mutant mice. Zippering of lacteal junctions by disassembly of cytoskeletal VE-cadherin anchors prevented chylomicron uptake in wild-type mice. These data suggest that lacteal junctions may be targets for preventing dietary fat uptake.</p>

Reducing food’s environmental impacts through producers and consumers

To identify solutions that are effective under this heterogeneity, we consolidated data covering five environmental indicators; 38,700 farms; and 1600 processors, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ing types, and retailers. Impact can vary 50-fold among producers of the same product, creating substantial mitigation opportunities. However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low impacts, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce impacts. Most strikingly, impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change. Cumulatively, our findings support an approach where producers monitor their own impacts, flexibly meet environmental targets by choosing from multiple practices, and communicate their impacts to consumers.</p>

Sustained climate warming drives declining marine biological productivity

The trapping drives a global-scale nutrient redistribution, with net transfer to the deep ocean. Ensuing surface nutrient reductions north of 30°S drive steady declines in primary production and carbon export (decreases of 24 and 41%, respectively, by 2300). Potential fishery yields, constrained by lower–trophic-level productivity, decrease by more than 20% globally and by nearly 60% in the North Atlantic. Continued high levels of greenhouse gas emissions could suppress marine biological productivity for a millennium.</p>

How are DNAs woven into chromosomes?
<p>It was not recognized that chromosomes contain one immensely long DNA molecule until Kleinschmidt <i>et al.</i> published electron micrographs of a lysed bacterial cell with DNA spilling out that contained no apparent breaks and, indeed, not even any free ends (<i>1</i>). We now know that before replication, each of our chromosomes contains a single DNA molecule of immense length. If the DNA of an average human chromatid were a wire with a diameter of 2 mm, then this wire would be 50 km long. The vast length of chromosomal DNAs poses a number of fundamental problems. For example, how are they <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ed during cell division into cylindrical threadlike chromatids? On page 672 of this issue, Terakawa <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) describe an activity associated with a protein complex called condensin that has the potential to answer this. Remarkably, it might also explain chromosome segregation in bacteria as well as the mechanism that regulates enhancer-promoter interactions during development.</p>

Zones, spots, and planetary-scale waves beating in brown dwarf atmospheres

We analyzed a long-term Spitzer Space Telescope infrared monitoring campaign of brown dwarfs to constrain cloud cover variations over a total of 192 rotations. The infrared brightness evolution is dominated by beat patterns caused by planetary-scale wave pairs and by a small number of bright spots. The beating waves have similar amplitudes but slightly different apparent periods because of differing velocities or directions. The power spectrum of intermediate-temperature brown dwarfs resembles that of Neptune, indicating the presence of zonal temperature and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> speed variations. Our findings explain three previously puzzling behaviors seen in brown dwarf brightness variations.</p>

On the generation of solar spicules and Alfvénic waves
<p>In the lower solar atmosphere, the chromosphere is permeated by jets known as spicules, in which plasma is propelled at speeds of 50 to 150 kilometers per second into the corona. The origin of the spicules is poorly understood, although they are expected to play a role in heating the million-degree corona and are associated with Alfvéííénic waves that help drive the solar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>. We compare magnetohydrodynamic simulations of spicules with observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Spicules are shown to occur when magnetic tension is amplified and transported upward through interactions between ions and neutrals or ambipolar diffusion. The tension is impulsively released to drive flows, heat plasma (through ambipolar diffusion), and generate Alfvéííéénic waves.</p>

New Ebola outbreak rings alarm bells early
<p>An outbreak of Ebola in a remote region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has led to a swift and robust response from the country and the international community. In the wake of the devastating West African Ebola that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong>ed out of control in 2014, there’s acute awareness that virus can cause mayhem if not contained early. This time, there’s also the possibility of using an unlicensed but promising vaccine that had great success in 2015 in a trial in Guinea. But given the confusing details of the DRC outbreak—the first case apparently fell ill 21 April and he’s only one of two confirmed cases to date—the government has yet to request the vaccine. And in collaboration with international partners, the government is closely following several dozen suspect cases and more than 350 of their contacts to decide how best to stop spread. </p>

Assembly of a nucleus-like structure during viral replication in bacteria
<p>We observed the assembly of a nucleus-like structure in bacteria during viral infection. Using fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, we showed that <i>Pseudomonas chlororaphis</i> phage 201φ2-1 assembled a compartment that separated viral DNA from the cytoplasm. The phage compartment was centered by a bipolar tubulin-based spindle, and it segregated phage and bacterial proteins according to function. Proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription localized inside the compartment, whereas proteins involved in translation and nucleotide synthesis localized outside. Later during infection, viral capsids assembled on the cytoplasmic membrane and moved to the surface of the compartment for DNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ing. Ultimately, viral particles were released from the compartment and the cell lysed. These results demonstrate that phages have evolved a specialized structure to compartmentalize viral replication.</p>

An unexpected disruption of the atmospheric quasi-biennial oscillation
<p>One of the most repeatable phenomena seen in the atmosphere, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) between prevailing eastward and westward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong> jets in the equatorial stratosphere (approximately 16 to 50 kilometers altitude), was unexpectedly disrupted in February 2016. An unprecedented westward jet formed within the eastward phase in the lower stratosphere and cannot be accounted for by the standard QBO paradigm based on vertical momentum transport. Instead, the primary cause was waves transporting momentum from the Northern Hemisphere. Seasonal forecasts did not predict the disruption, but analogous QBO disruptions are seen very occasionally in some climate simulations. A return to more typical QBO behavior within the next year is forecast, although the possibility of more frequent occurrences of similar disruptions is projected for a warming climate.</p>

Transverse Demagnetization Dynamics of a Unitary Fermi Gas
<sec><title>Untwisting the Spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong></title><p>Ultracold Fermi gases in the so-called unitary regime—where the diverging interactions between atoms make their thermodynamics universal—are an excellent test bed for an array of strongly interacting matter systems. The transport characteristics in this regime are particularly intriguing, and a discrepancy between two- and three-dimensional transport coefficients has been observed. <bold>Bardon <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 722) studied the demagnetization dynamics of a three-dimensional Fermi gas. The gas was initially polarized along a single direction and was noninteracting. An applied magnetic field gradient then caused a spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong> to form; as the gas relaxed from this state, the authors extracted the diffusion coefficient and observed the buildup of interactions between the atoms.</p></sec>

A New Wrap for Neuronal Activity?
<p>As we learn and experience the world around us, our brains are remodeling neuronal pathways. Is this remodeling only a property of neurons, or are other brain cell types also adapting and contributing to learning? A substantial proportion of cells in the mammalian brain are oligodendrocytes and their precursors (collectively called oligodendroglia). Oligodendrocytes generate multiple myelin sheaths, lipid-rich extensions of specialized plasma membrane that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spiral</span></strong>ly coat condensed layers around neurons. This insulation facilitates rapid nerve conduction, increasing velocities of neuron signals 10-fold (<i>1</i>) by restricting current flow to the small gaps between sheaths—the nodes of Ranvier. More than half of the human brain is composed of myelinated nerves (“white matter”). With such extensive myelinated neural networks, it raises the questions: Do the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the brain also adapt as neural circuits are modified in response to activity, and does adaptation of oligodendrocytes then affect the underlying neural circuits? On page 487 of this issue, Gibson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) provide new evidence to address how neuron activity may promote oligodendroglia changes.</p>

A Histone Acetylation Switch Regulates H2A.Z Deposition by the SWR-C Remodeling Enzyme
<sec><title>Variants and Regulation</title><p>Genomic DNA is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ed into nucleosomes by spooling around histone proteins. Histone variants and the composition of nucleosomes can influence gene expression, as well as other chromatin-mediated processes. For example, the H2A.Z histone variant flanks RNA polII promoters, and such nucleosomes show rapid turnover, as well as enrichment for histone H3 acetylated at lysine 56 (H3-K56Ac). <bold>Watanabe <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 195) show that H3-K56Ac alters the substrate specificity of the chromatin remodeling enzyme SWR-C, which normally evicts nucleosomal H2A.Z such that it now rapidly exchanges both canonical H2A and the variant H2A.Z, modulating nucleosome turnover and therefore influencing gene regulation. Pathways are dramatically simplified, promoting proper folding.</p></sec>

<i>Drosophila</i> H1 Regulates the Genetic Activity of Heterochromatin by Recruitment of Su(var)3-9
<sec><title>Silencing Transposons</title><p>Eukaryotic DNA is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>ed onto nucleosomes, which are composed of four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). Chromatin also contains a fifth histone, H1, which binds to both the core particles and the “linker” DNA that joins adjacent nucleosomes, where it helps chromatin to fold into higher-order structures and generally silences gene expression. In <i>Drosophila</i> germline and somatic cells and tissues, <bold>Lu <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 78) found that the repressive function of H1 in vivo was directed toward transposable elements and independent of small RNA silencing pathways. Instead, H1 acted through direct recruitment of the histone methyltransferase Su(var)3–9, which methylates histone H3 lysine 9, a repressive histone mark.</p></sec>

Consensus Coexpression Network Analysis Identifies Key Regulators of Flower and Fruit Development in Wild Strawberry
<p>The diploid strawberry, <i>Fragaria vesca</i>, is a developing model system for the economically important Rosaceae family. Strawberry fleshy fruit develops from the floral receptacle and its ripening is nonclimacteric. The external seed configuration of strawberry fruit facilitates the study of seed-to-fruit cross tissue communication, particularly phytohormone biosynthesis and transport. To investigate strawberry fruit development, we previously generated spatial and temporal transcriptome data profiling <i>F. vesca</i> flower and fruit development pre- and postfertilization. In this study, we combined 46 of our existing RNA-seq libraries to generate coexpression networks using the Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>e in R. We then applied a post-hoc consensus clustering approach and used bootstrapping to demonstrate consensus clustering’s ability to produce robust and reproducible clusters. Further, we experimentally tested hypotheses based on the networks, including increased iron transport from the receptacle to the seed postfertilization and characterized a <i>F. vesca</i> floral mutant and its candidate gene. To increase their utility, the networks are presented in a web interface (<ext-link>www.fv.rosaceaefruits.org</ext-link>) for easy exploration and identification of coexpressed genes. Together, the work reported here illustrates ways to generate robust networks optimized for the mining of large transcriptome data sets, thereby providing a useful resource for hypothesis generation and experimental design in strawberry and related Rosaceae fruit crops.</p>

The Impacts of Fluctuating Light on Crop Performance
<p>Rapidly changing light conditions can reduce carbon gain and productivity in field crops because photosynthetic responses to light fluctuations are not instantaneous. Plant responses to fluctuating light occur across levels of organizational complexity from entire canopies to the biochemistry of a single reaction and across orders of magnitude of time. Although light availability and variation at the top of the canopy are largely dependent on the solar angle and degree of cloudiness, lower crop canopies rely more heavily on light in the form of sunflecks, the quantity of which depends mostly on canopy structure but also may be affected by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wind</span></strong>. The ability of leaf photosynthesis to respond rapidly to these variations in light intensity is restricted by the relatively slow opening/closing of stomata, activation/deactivation of C<sub>3</sub> cycle enzymes, and up-regulation/down-regulation of photoprotective processes. The metabolic complexity of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis creates the apparently contradictory possibilities that C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis may be both more and less resilient than C<sub>3</sub> to dynamic light regimes, depending on the frequency at which these light fluctuations occur. We review the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these limitations to photosynthesis in fluctuating light that have shown promise in improving the response times of photosynthesis-related processes to changes in light intensity.</p>

SLiM 2: Flexible, Interactive Forward Genetic Simulations
<p>Modern population genomic datasets hold immense promise for revealing the evolutionary processes operating in natural populations, but a crucial prerequisite for this goal is the ability to model realistic evolutionary scenarios and predict their expected patterns in genomic data. To that end, we present SLiM 2: an evolutionary simulation framework that combines a powerful, fast engine for forward population genetic simulations with the capability of modeling a wide variety of complex evolutionary scenarios. SLiM achieves this flexibility through scriptability, which provides control over most aspects of the simulated evolutionary scenarios with a simple R-like scripting language called Eidos. An example SLiM simulation is presented to illustrate the power of this approach. SLiM 2 also includes a graphical user interface for simulation construction, interactive runtime control, and dynamic visualization of simulation output, facilitating easy and fast model development with quick prototyping and visual debugging. We conclude with a performance comparison between SLiM and two other popular forward genetic simulation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">packag</span></strong>es.</p>

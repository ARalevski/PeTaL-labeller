The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the LHB tendon   in the bicipital groove was measured pre-operatively in both shoulders   using ultrasound. There were 154 asymptomatic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tears   in the contralateral shoulder.

ERK signaling pathway regulates sleep duration through activity-induced gene expression during wakefulness
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness is accompanied by experience-dependent synaptic plasticity and an increase in activity-regulated gene transcription. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>-induced genes are certainly markers of neuronal activity and may also directly regulate the duration of and need for sleep. We stimulated murine cortical cultures with the neuromodulatory signals that are known to control <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness in the brain and found that norepinephrine alone or a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ture of these neuromodulators induced activity-regulated gene transcription. Pharmacological inhibition of the various signaling pathways involved in the regulation of gene expression indicated that the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is the principal one mediating the effects of waking neuromodulators on gene expression. In mice, ERK phosphorylation in the cortex increased and decreased with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness and sleep. Whole-body or cortical neuron–specific deletion of <i>Erk1</i> or <i>Erk2</i> significantly increased the duration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness in mice, and pharmacological inhibition of ERK phosphorylation decreased sleep duration and increased the duration of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness bouts. Thus, this signaling pathway, which is highly conserved from <i>Drosophila</i> to mammals, is a key pathway that links waking experience–induced neuronal gene expression to sleep duration and quality.</p>

The paraventricular thalamus is a critical thalamic area for wakefulness
<p>Clinical observations indicate that the paramedian region of the thalamus is a critical node for controlling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness. However, the specific nucleus and neural circuitry for this function remain unknown. Using in vivo fiber photometry or multichannel electrophysiological recordings in mice, we found that glutamatergic neurons of the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) exhibited high activities during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness. Suppression of PVT neuronal activity caused a reduction in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness, whereas activation of PVT neurons induced a transition from sleep to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness and an acceleration of emergence from general anesthesia. Moreover, our findings indicate that the PVT–nucleus accumbens projections and hypocretin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus to PVT glutamatergic neurons’ projections are the effector pathways for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness control. These results demonstrate that the PVT is a key <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness-controlling nucleus in the thalamus.</p>

Reconciling solar and stellar magnetic cycles with nonlinear dynamo simulations
<p>The magnetic fields of solar-type stars are observed to cycle over decadal periods—11 years in the case of the Sun. The fields originate in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">turbul</span></strong>ent convective layers of stars and have a complex dependency upon stellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion rate. We have performed a set of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">turbul</span></strong>ent global simulations that exhibit magnetic cycles varying systematically with stellar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and luminosity. We find that the magnetic cycle period is inversely proportional to the Rossby number, which quantifies the influence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">turbul</span></strong>ent convection. The trend relies on a fundamentally nonlinear dynamo process and is compatible with the Sun’s cycle and those of other solar-type stars.</p>

The sleep-wake cycle regulates brain interstitial fluid tau in mice and CSF tau in humans
<p>The sleep-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong> cycle regulates interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of β-amyloid (Aβ) that accumulates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Furthermore, chronic sleep deprivation (SD) increases Aβ plaques. However, tau, not Aβ, accumulation appears to drive AD neurodegeneration. We tested whether ISF/CSF tau and tau seeding and spreading were influenced by the sleep-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong> cycle and SD. Mouse ISF tau was increased ~90% during normal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness versus sleep and ~100% during SD. Human CSF tau also increased more than 50% during SD. In a tau seeding-and-spreading model, chronic SD increased tau pathology spreading. Chemogenetically driven <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>fulness in mice also significantly increased both ISF Aβ and tau. Thus, the sleep-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong> cycle regulates ISF tau, and SD increases ISF and CSF tau as well as tau pathology spreading.</p>

Rapid change of superconductivity and electron-phonon coupling through critical doping in Bi-2212
<p>Electron-boson coupling plays a key role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity for many systems. However, in copper-based high–critical temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ors, its relation to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity remains controversial despite strong spectroscopic fingerprints. In this study, we used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to find a pronounced correlation between the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing gap and the bosonic coupling strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+δ</sub>. The bosonic coupling strength rapidly increases from the overdoped Fermi liquid regime to the optimally doped strange metal, concomitant with the quadrupled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing gap and the doubled gap-to-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> ratio across the pseudogap boundary. This synchronized lattice and electronic response suggests that the effects of electronic interaction and the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) reinforce each other in a positive-feedback loop upon entering the strange-metal regime, which in turn drives a stronger <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity.</p>

Revealing the subfemtosecond dynamics of orbital angular momentum in nanoplasmonic vortices
<p>The ability of light to carry and deliver orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the form of optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vortic</span></strong>es has attracted much interest. The physical properties of light with a helical wavefront can be confined onto two-dimensional surfaces with subwavelength dimensions in the form of plasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vortic</span></strong>es, opening avenues for thus far unknown light-matter interactions. Because of their extreme <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional velocity, the ultrafast dynamics of such <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vortic</span></strong>es remained unexplored. Here we show the detailed spatiotemporal evolution of nano<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vortic</span></strong>es using time-resolved two-photon photoemission electron microscopy. We observe both long- and short-range plasmonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">vortic</span></strong>es confined to deep subwavelength dimensions on the scale of 100 nanometers with nanometer spatial resolution and subfemtosecond time-step resolution. Finally, by measuring the angular velocity of the vortex, we directly extract the OAM magnitude of light.</p>

Concerted Divergence after Gene Duplication in Polycomb Repressive Complexes
<p>Duplicated genes are a major contributor to genome evolution and phenotypic novelty. There are multiple possible evolutionary fates of duplicated genes. Here, we provide an example of concerted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of simultaneously duplicated genes whose products function in the same complex. We studied POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX2 (PRC2) in Brassicaceae. The VERNALIZATION (VRN)-PRC2 complex contains VRN2 and SWINGER (SWN), and both genes were duplicated during a whole-genome duplication to generate FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 (FIS2) and MEDEA (MEA), which function in the Brassicaceae-specific FIS-PRC2 complex that regulates seed development. We examined the expression of <i>FIS2</i>, <i>MEA</i>, and their paralogs, compared their cytosine and histone methylation patterns, and analyzed the sequence evolution of the genes. We found that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have reproductive-specific expression patterns that are correlated and derived from the broadly expressed <i>VRN2</i> and <i>SWN</i> in outgroup species. In vegetative tissues of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), repressive methylation marks are enriched in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>, whereas active marks are associated with their paralogs. We detected comparable accelerated amino acid substitution rates in <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> but not in their paralogs. We also show <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence patterns of the PRC2-associated <i>VERNALIZATION5/VIN3-LIKE2</i> that are similar to <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i>. These lines of evidence indicate that <i>FIS2</i> and <i>MEA</i> have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed in concert, resulting in functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of the PRC2 complexes in Brassicaceae. This type of concerted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence is a previously unreported fate of duplicated genes. In addition, the Brassicaceae-specific FIS-PRC2 complex modified the regulatory pathways in female gametophyte and seed development.</p>

<i>In vivo</i> three-dimensional kinematics of normal knees during different high-flexion activities

The purpose of this   study was to investigate the 3D kinematics of normal knees during   high-flexion activities. Our hypothesis was that the femorotibial   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion, varus-valgus angle, translations, and kinematic pathway   of normal knees during high-flexion activities, varied according   to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> kinematics of eight   normal knees in four male volunteers (mean age 41.8 years; 37 to   53) using 2D and 3D registration technique, and modelled the knees   with a computer aided design program. Each subject squatted, kneeled,   and sat cross-legged. We evaluated the femoral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion and varus-valgus   angle relative to the tibia and anteroposterior translation of the   medial and lateral side, using the transepicodylar axis as our femoral   reference relative to the perpendicular projection on to the tibial   plateau. This method evaluates the femur medially from what has   elsewhere been described as the extension facet centre, and differs   from the method classically applied. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>During squatting and kneeling, the knees displayed femoral external   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion.

From 100°, femoral external <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion was observed.   No significant difference in varus-valgus angle was seen between   squatting and kneeling, whereas a varus position was observed from   140° when sitting cross-legged. The measure kinematic pathway using   our methodology found during squatting a medial pivoting pattern   from 0° to 40° and bicondylar rollback from 40° to 150°.

Strongly correlated quantum walks with a 12-qubit superconducting processor
<p>Quantum walks are the quantum analogs of classical random walks, which allow for the simulation of large-scale quantum many-body systems and the realization of universal quantum computation without time-dependent control. We experimentally demonstrate quantum walks of one and two strongly correlated microwave photons in a one-dimensional array of 12 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits with short-range interactions. First, in one-photon quantum walks, we observed the propagation of the density and correlation of the quasiparticle excitation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubit and quantum entanglement between qubit pairs. Second, when implementing two-photon quantum walks by exciting two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits, we observed the fermionization of strongly interacting photons from the measured time-dependent long-range anticorrelations, representing the antibunching of photons with attractive interactions. The demonstration of quantum walks on a quantum processor, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing qubits as artificial atoms and tomographic readout, paves the way to quantum simulation of many-body phenomena and universal quantum computation.</p>

Tuning superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene
<p>Materials with flat electronic bands often exhibit exotic quantum phenomena owing to strong correlations. An isolated low-energy flat band can be induced in bilayer graphene by simply <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ing the layers by 1.1°, resulting in the appearance of gate-tunable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing and correlated insulating phases. In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to the twist angle, the interlayer coupling can be varied to precisely tune these phases. We induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity at a twist angle larger than 1.1°—in which correlated phases are otherwise absent—by varying the interlayer spacing with hydrostatic pressure. Our low-disorder devices reveal details about the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing phase diagram and its relationship to the nearby insulator. Our results demonstrate twisted bilayer graphene to be a distinctively tunable platform for exploring correlated states.</p>

Twistable electronics with dynamically rotatable heterostructures

This effect makes it theoretically possible to realize a new class of twistable electronics in which properties can be manipulated on demand by means of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion. We demonstrate a device architecture in which a layered heterostructure can be dynamically twisted in situ.

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor
<p>The anomalous metallic state in the high-temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing cuprates is masked by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity near a quantum critical point. Applying high magnetic fields to suppress <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity has enabled detailed studies of the normal state, yet the direct effect of strong magnetic fields on the metallic state is poorly understood.

Probing optically silent superfluid stripes in cuprates
<p>Unconventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in the cuprates coexists with other types of electronic order. However, some of these orders are invisible to most experimental probes because of their symmetry. For example, the possible existence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superfluid</span></strong> stripes is not easily validated with linear optics, because the stripe alignment causes interlayer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ing tunneling to vanish on average. Here we show that this frustration is removed in the nonlinear optical response. A giant terahertz third harmonic, characteristic of nonlinear Josephson tunneling, is observed in La<sub>1.885</sub>Ba<sub>0.115</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> above the transition temperature <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 13 kelvin and up to the charge-ordering temperature <i>T</i><sub>co</sub> = 55 kelvin. We model these results by hypothesizing the presence of a pair density wave condensate, in which nonlinear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing of optically silent tunneling modes drives large dipole-carrying supercurrents.</p>

Giant nonlinear response at a plasmonic nanofocus drives efficient four-wave mixing
<p>Efficient optical frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing typically must accumulate over large interaction lengths because nonlinear responses in natural materials are inherently weak. This limits the efficiency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing processes owing to the requirement of phase matching. Here, we report efficient four-wave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing (FWM) over micrometer-scale interaction lengths at telecommunications wavelengths on silicon. We used an integrated plasmonic gap waveguide that strongly confines light within a nonlinear organic polymer. The gap waveguide intensifies light by nanofocusing it to a mode cross-section of a few tens of nanometers, thus generating a nonlinear response so strong that efficient FWM accumulates over wavelength-scale distances. This technique opens up nonlinear optics to a regime of relaxed phase matching, with the possibility of compact, broadband, and efficient frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing integrated with silicon photonics.</p>

Imaging rotational dynamics of nanoparticles in liquid by 4D electron microscopy
<p>In real time and space, four-dimensional electron microscopy (4D EM) has enabled observation of transient structures and morphologies of inorganic and organic materials. We have extended 4D EM to include liquid cells without the time resolution being limited by the response of the detector.

Evidence for bulk superconductivity in pure bismuth single crystals at ambient pressure
<p>At ambient pressure, bulk rhombohedral bismuth is a semimetal that remains in the normal state down to at least 10 millikelvin. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in bulk bismuth is thought to be unlikely because of the extremely low carrier density. We observed bulk <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in pure bismuth single crystals below 0.53 millikelvin at ambient pressure, with an estimated critical magnetic field of 5.2 microteslas at 0 kelvin. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in bismuth cannot be explained by the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory because its adiabatic approximation does not hold true for bismuth. Future theoretical work will be needed to understand <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ivity in the nonadiabatic limit in systems with low carrier densities and unusual band structures, such as bismuth.</p>

Evolutionary and Functional Analysis of Membrane-Bound NAC Transcription Factor Genes in Soybean
<p>Functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence is thought to be an important evolutionary driving force for the retention of duplicate genes. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of soybean (<i>Glycine max</i>) membrane-bound NAC transcription factor (NTL) genes. NTLs are thought to be components of stress signaling and unique in their requirement for proteolytic cleavage to free them from the membrane. Most of the 15 <i>GmNTL</i> genes appear to have evolved under strong purifying selection. By analyzing the phylogenetic tree and gene synteny, we identified seven duplicate gene pairs generated by the latest whole-genome duplication. The members of each pair were shown to have variously <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed at the transcriptional (organ specificity and responsiveness to stress), posttranscriptional (alternative splicing), and protein (proteolysis-mediated membrane release and transactivation activity) levels. The dormant (full-length protein) and active (protein without a transmembrane motif) forms of one pair of duplicated gene products (GmNTL1/GmNLT11) were each separately constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). The heteroexpression of active but not dormant forms of these proteins caused improved tolerance to abiotic stresses, suggesting that membrane release was required for their functionality. Arabidopsis carrying the dormant form of GmNTL1 was more tolerant to hydrogen peroxide, which induces its membrane release. Tolerance was not increased in the line carrying dormant GmNTL11, which was not released by hydrogen peroxide treatment. Thus, NTL-release pattern changes may cause phenotypic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence. It was concluded that a variety of functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ences contributed to the retention of these <i>GmNTL</i> duplicates.</p>

Inference of Natural Selection from Interspersed Genomic Elements Based on Polymorphism and Divergence
<p>Complete genome sequences contain valuable information about natural selection, but this information is difficult to access for short, widely scattered noncoding elements such as transcription factor binding sites or small noncoding RNAs. Here, we introduce a new computational method, called <i>I</i>nference of <i>N</i>atural <i>S</i>election from <i>I</i>nterspersed <i>G</i>enomically co<i>H</i>erent elemen<i>T</i>s (INSIGHT), for measuring the influence of natural selection on such elements. INSIGHT uses a generative probabilistic model to contrast patterns of polymorphism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence in the elements of interest with those in flanking neutral sites, pooling weak information from many short elements in a manner that accounts for variation among loci in mutation rates and coalescent times. The method is able to disentangle the contributions of weak negative, strong negative, and positive selection based on their distinct effects on patterns of polymorphism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence. It obtains information about <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence from multiple outgroup genomes using a general statistical phylogenetic approach. The INSIGHT model is efficiently fitted to genome-wide data using an approximate expectation maximization algorithm. Using simulations, we show that the method can accurately estimate the parameters of interest even in complex demographic scenarios, and that it significantly improves on methods based on summary statistics describing polymorphism and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence. To demonstrate the usefulness of INSIGHT, we apply it to several classes of human noncoding RNAs and to GATA2-binding sites in the human genome.</p>

Arthroscopic decompression not recommended in the treatment of rotator cuff tendinopathy
<sec><title>Aims</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tendinopathy has a multifactorial origin. Rejecting   the mechanistic theory has also led to abandoning operative treatment   at initial presentation in the first line.

The aim of this   study was to assess the long-term additional benefits of subacromial decompression   in the treatment of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tendinopathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>This randomised controlled trial of 140 patients (52 men, 88   women, mean age 47.1 years; 18 to 60) with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tendinopathy   extended previous work up to a maximum of 13 years. The patients   were randomised into two treatment groups: arthroscopic acromioplasty   and a supervised exercise treatment and a similar supervised exercise   treatment alone. Self-reported pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS)   was the primary outcome measure.

Disturbed Placental Imprinting in Preeclampsia Leads to Altered Expression of DLX5, a Human-Specific Early Trophoblast Marker
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Preeclampsia is a complex and common human-specific pregnancy syndrome associated with placental pathology. The human specificity provides both intellectual and methodological challenges, lacking a robust model system. Given the role of imprinted genes in human placentation and the vulnerability of imprinted genes to loss of imprinting changes, there has been extensive speculation, but no robust evidence, that imprinted genes are involved in preeclampsia. Our study aims to investigate whether <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disturb</span></strong>ed imprinting contributes to preeclampsia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We first aimed to confirm that preeclampsia is a disease of the placenta by generating and analyzing genome-wide molecular data on well-characterized patient material. We performed high-throughput transcriptome analyses of multiple placenta samples from healthy controls and patients with preeclampsia. Next, we identified differentially expressed genes in preeclamptic placentas and intersected them with the list of human imprinted genes. We used bioinformatics/statistical analyses to confirm association between imprinting and preeclampsia and to predict biological processes affected in preeclampsia. Validation included epigenetic and cellular assays. In terms of human specificity, we established an in vitro invasion-differentiation trophoblast model. Our comparative phylogenetic analysis involved single-cell transcriptome data of human, macaque, and mouse preimplantation embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disturb</span></strong>ed placental imprinting in preeclampsia and revealed potential candidates, including <i>GATA3</i> and <i>DLX5</i>, with poorly explored imprinted status and no prior association with preeclampsia. As a result of loss of imprinting, <i>DLX5</i> was upregulated in 69% of preeclamptic placentas. Levels of <i>DLX5</i> correlated with classic preeclampsia markers. DLX5 is expressed in human but not in murine trophoblast. The DLX5<sup>high</sup> phenotype resulted in reduced proliferation, increased metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum stress-response activation in trophoblasts in vitro. The transcriptional profile of such cells mimics the transcriptome of preeclamptic placentas. Pan-mammalian comparative analysis identified <i>DLX5</i> as part of the human-specific regulatory network of trophoblast differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our analysis provides evidence of a true association among <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disturb</span></strong>ed imprinting, gene expression, and preeclampsia. As a result of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disturb</span></strong>ed imprinting, the upregulated <i>DLX5</i> affects trophoblast proliferation. Our in vitro model might fill a vital niche in preeclampsia research. Human-specific regulatory circuitry of <i>DLX5</i> might help explain certain aspects of preeclampsia.</p></sec>

Dirac electrons in a dodecagonal graphene quasicrystal
<p>Quantum states of quasiparticles in solids are dictated by symmetry. We have experimentally demonstrated quantum states of Dirac electrons in a two-dimensional quasicrystal without translational symmetry. A dodecagonal quasicrystalline order was realized by epitaxial growth of twisted bilayer graphene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ed exactly 30°. We grew the graphene quasicrystal up to a millimeter scale on a silicon carbide surface while maintaining the single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion angle over an entire sample and successfully isolated the quasicrystal from a substrate, demonstrating its structural and chemical stability under ambient conditions. Multiple Dirac cones replicated with the 12-fold <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ional symmetry were observed in angle-resolved photoemission spectra, which revealed anomalous strong interlayer coupling with quasi-periodicity. Our study provides a way to explore physical properties of relativistic fermions with controllable quasicrystalline orders.</p>

Mixed tailing by TENT4A and TENT4B shields mRNA from rapid deadenylation
<p>RNA tails play integral roles in the regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation and decay. Guanylation of the poly(A) tail was discovered recently, yet the enzymology and function remain obscure. Here we identify TENT4A (PAPD7) and TENT4B (PAPD5) as the enzymes responsible for mRNA guanylation. Purified TENT4 proteins generate a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed poly(A) tail with intermittent non-adenosine residues, the most common of which is guanosine. A single guanosine residue is sufficient to impede the deadenylase CCR4-NOT complex, which trims the tail and exposes guanosine at the 3′ end. Consistently, depletion of TENT4A and TENT4B leads to a decrease in mRNA half-life and abundance in cells. Thus, TENT4A and TENT4B produce a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed tail that shields mRNA from rapid deadenylation. Our study unveils the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed tailing and expands the complexity of posttranscriptional gene regulation.</p>

Most of the proposed topological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">superconduct</span></strong>ors are realized in difficult-to-fabricate heterostructures at very low temperatures.

Morphology, muscle capacity, skill, and maneuvering ability in hummingbirds
<p>How does agility evolve? This question is challenging because natural movement has many degrees of freedom and can be influenced by multiple traits. We used computer vision to record thousands of translations, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ions, and turns from more than 200 hummingbirds from 25 species, revealing that distinct performance metrics are correlated and that species <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>e in their maneuvering style. Our analysis demonstrates that the enhanced maneuverability of larger species is explained by their proportionately greater muscle capacity and lower wing loading. Fast acceleration maneuvers evolve by recruiting changes in muscle capacity, whereas fast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ions and sharp turns evolve by recruiting changes in wing morphology. Both species and individuals use turns that play to their strengths. These results demonstrate how both skill and biomechanical traits shape maneuvering behavior.</p>

Ultrastructural evidence for synaptic scaling across the wake/sleep cycle
<p>It is assumed that synaptic strengthening and weakening balance throughout learning to avoid runaway potentiation and memory interference. However, energetic and informational considerations suggest that potentiation should occur primarily during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>, when animals learn, and depression should occur during sleep. We measured 6920 synapses in mouse motor and sensory cortices using three-dimensional electron microscopy. The axon-spine interface (ASI) decreased ~18% after sleep compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>. This decrease was proportional to ASI size, which is indicative of scaling. Scaling was selective, sparing synapses that were large and lacked recycling endosomes. Similar scaling occurred for spine head volume, suggesting a distinction between weaker, more plastic synapses (~80%) and stronger, more stable synapses. These results support the hypothesis that a core function of sleep is to renormalize overall synaptic strength increased by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">wake</span></strong>.</p>

Two Tabersonine 6,7-Epoxidases Initiate Lochnericine-Derived Alkaloid Biosynthesis in <i>Catharanthus roseus</i>
<p>Lochnericine is a major monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) in the roots of Madagascar periwinkle (<i>Catharanthus roseus</i>). Lochnericine is derived from the stereoselective C6,C7-epoxidation of tabersonine and can be metabolized further to generate other complex MIAs. While the enzymes responsible for its downstream modifications have been characterized, those involved in lochnericine biosynthesis remain unknown. By combining gene correlation studies, functional assays, and transient gene inactivation, we identified two highly conserved P450s that efficiently catalyze the epoxidation of tabersonine: tabersonine 6,7-epoxidase isoforms 1 and 2 (TEX1 and TEX2). Both proteins are quite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent from the previously characterized tabersonine 2,3-epoxidase and are more closely related to tabersonine 16-hydroxylase, involved in vindoline biosynthesis in leaves. Biochemical characterization of TEX1/2 revealed their strict substrate specificity for tabersonine and their inability to epoxidize 19-hydroxytabersonine, indicating that they catalyze the first step in the pathway leading to horhammericine production. <i>TEX1</i> and <i>TEX2</i> displayed complementary expression profiles, with <i>TEX1</i> expressed mainly in roots and <i>TEX2</i> in aerial organs. Our results suggest that <i>TEX1</i> and <i>TEX2</i> originated from a gene duplication event and later acquired <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent, organ-specific regulatory elements for lochnericine biosynthesis throughout the plant, as supported by the presence of lochnericine in flowers. Finally, through the sequential expression of <i>TEX1</i> and up to four other MIA biosynthetic genes in yeast, we reconstituted the 19-acetylhorhammericine biosynthetic pathway and produced tailor-made MIAs by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing enzymatic modules that are naturally spatially separated in the plant. These results lay the groundwork for the metabolic engineering of tabersonine/lochnericine derivatives of pharmaceutical interest.</p>

Progressive Recombination Suppression and Differentiation in Recently Evolved Neo-sex Chromosomes
<p>Recombination suppression leads to the structural and functional differentiation of sex chromosomes and is thus a crucial step in the process of sex chromosome evolution. Despite extensive theoretical work, the exact processes and mechanisms of recombination suppression and differentiation are not well understood. In threespine sticklebacks (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), a different sex chromosome system has recently evolved by a fusion between the Y chromosome and an autosome in the Japan Sea lineage, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ed from the ancestor of other lineages approximately 2 Ma. We investigated the evolutionary dynamics and differentiation processes of sex chromosomes based on comparative analyses of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent lineages using 63 microsatellite loci. Both chromosome-wide differentiation patterns and phylogenetic inferences with X and Y alleles indicated that the ancestral sex chromosomes were extensively differentiated before the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence of these lineages. In contrast, genetic differentiation appeared to have proceeded only in a small region of the neo-sex chromosomes. The recombination maps constructed for the Japan Sea lineage indicated that recombination has been suppressed or reduced over a large region spanning the ancestral and neo-sex chromosomes. Chromosomal regions exhibiting genetic differentiation and suppressed or reduced recombination were detected continuously and sequentially in the neo-sex chromosomes, suggesting that differentiation has gradually spread from the fusion point following the extension of recombination suppression. Our study illustrates an ongoing process of sex chromosome differentiation, providing empirical support for the theoretical model postulating that recombination suppression and differentiation proceed in a gradual manner in the very early stage of sex chromosome evolution.</p>

The diagnostic performance of radiographic criteria to detect aseptic acetabular component loosening after revision total hip arthroplasty
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>This study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of radiographic   criteria to detect aseptic acetabular loosening after revision total   hip arthroplasty (THA). Secondary aims were to determine the predictive   values of different thresholds of migration and to determine the   predictive values of radiolucency criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Acetabular component migration to re-revision was measured retrospectively   using Ein-Bild-Rontgen-Analyse (EBRA-Cup) and manual measurements   (Sutherland method) in two groups: Group A, 52 components (48 patients) found   not loose at re-revision and Group B, 42 components (36 patients)   found loose at re-revision between 1980 and 2015. The presence and   extent of radiolucent lines was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using EBRA, both proximal translation and s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agit</span></strong>tal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion were   excellent diagnostic tests for detecting aseptic loosening. The   area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was   0.94 and 0.93, respectively. The thresholds of 2.5 mm proximal translation   or 2° s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agit</span></strong>tal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion (EBRA) in combination with radiolucency   criteria had a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88% to detect   aseptic loosening. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive   value and negative predictive value (NPV) of radiolucency criteria   were 41%, 100%, 100% and 68% respectively. Manual measurements of   both proximal translation and s<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">agit</span></strong>tal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion were very good diagnostic tests.   The area under the ROC curve was 0.86 and 0.92 respectively. However,   manual measurements had a decreased specificity compared with EBRA.   Radiolucency criteria had a poor sensitivity and NPV of 41% and   68% respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that EBRA and manual migration measurements   can be used as accurate diagnostic tools to detect aseptic loosening   of cementless acetabular components used at revision THA. Radiolucency   criteria should not be used in isolation to exclude loosening of   cementless acetabular components used at revision THA given their poor   sensitivity and NPV.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:458–64.</p></sec>

Comparison of the elution properties of commercially available gentamicin and bone cement containing vancomycin with ‘home-made’ preparations
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Vancomycin is commonly added to acrylic bone cement during revision   arthroplasty surgery. Proprietary cement preparations containing   vancomycin are available, but are significantly more expensive.   We investigated whether the elution of antibiotic from ‘home-made’   cement containing vancomycin was comparable with more expensive   commercially available vancomycin impregnated cement.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of 18 cement discs containing either proprietary CopalG+V;   or ‘home-made’ CopalR+G with vancomycin added by hand, were made.   Each disc contained the same amount of antibiotic (0.5 g gentamycin,   2 g vancomycin) and was immersed in ammonium acetate buffer in a   sealed container. Fluid from each container was sampled at eight   time points over a two-week period. The concentrations of gentamicin   and vancomycin in the fluid were analysed using high performance   liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The highest peak concentrations of antibiotic were observed from   the ‘home-made’ cements containing vancomycin, added as in the operating   theatre. The overall elution of antibiotic was, fivefold (vancomycin)   and twofold (gentamicin) greater from the ‘home-made’ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong> compared   with the commercially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed cement. The use of a vacuum during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ing   had no significant effect on antibiotic elution in any of the samples.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that the addition of 2 g vancomycin powder   to gentamicin-impregnated bone cement by hand significantly increases   the elution of both antibiotics compared with commercially prepared   cements containing vancomycin. We found no significant advantages   of using expensive commercially produced vancomycin-impregnated cement   and recommend the addition of vancomycin powder by hand in the operating theatre.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:73–7.</p></sec>

Effectiveness of open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (UKUFF)
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The appropriate management for patients with a degenerative tear   of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff remains controversial, but operative treatment,   particularly arthroscopic surgery, is increasingly being used. Our   aim in this paper was to compare the effectiveness of arthroscopic   with open repair of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>A total of 273 patients were recruited to a randomised comparison   trial (136 to arthroscopic surgery and 137 to open surgery) from   19 teaching and general hospitals in the United Kingdom. The surgeons   used their usual preferred method of repair. The Oxford Shoulder   Score (OSS), two years post-operatively, was the primary outcome   measure. Imaging of the shoulder was performed at one year after   surgery. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials,   ISRCTN97804283.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean OSS improved from 26.3 (standard deviation (<sc>sd</sc>)   8.2) at baseline, to 41.7 (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) two years post-operatively   for arthroscopic surgery and from 25.0 (<sc>sd</sc> 8.0) to 41.5   (<sc>sd</sc> 7.9) for open surgery. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis   showed no statistical difference between the groups at two years   (difference in OSS score -0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.75   to 1.22; p = 0.452). The confidence interval excluded the pre-determined   clinically important difference in the OSS of three points. The   rate of re-tear was not significantly different between the two groups   (46.4% for arthroscopic and 38.6% for open surgery; 95% CI -6.9   to 25.8; p = 0.256). Healed repairs had the most improved OSS. These   findings were the same when analysed per-protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is no evidence of difference in effectiveness between open   and arthroscopic repair of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tears. The rate of re-tear   is high in both groups, for all sizes of tear and ages and this   adversely affects the outcome.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:107–15.</p></sec>

The development of a quantitative scoring system to predict whether a large-to-massive rotator cuff tear can be arthroscopically repaired
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of the study was to develop a quantitative scoring system   to predict whether a large-to-massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tear was arthroscopically   reparable prior to surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We conducted a retrospective review of the pre-operative MR imaging   and surgical records of 87 patients (87 shoulders) who underwent   arthroscopic repair of a large-to-massive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>or cuff tear. Patients   were divided into two groups, based on the surgical outcome of the   repair. Of the 87 patients, 53 underwent complete repair (Group   I) and 34 an incomplete repair (Group II). Pre-operative MR images   were reviewed to quantify several variables. Between-group differences   were evaluated and multiple logistic regression analysis was used   to calculate the predictive value of significant variables.

Continuous distal migration and internal rotation of the C-stem prosthesis without any adverse clinical effects
<p>In 2005, we demonstrated that the polished triple-tapered   C-stem at two years had migrated distally and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ed internally.   From that series, 33 patients have now been followed radiologically,   clinically and by radiostereometric analysis (RSA) for up to ten   years. The distal migration within the cement mantle had continued   and reached a mean of 2 mm (0.5 to 4.0) at ten years. Internal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion,   also within the cement mantle, was a mean 3.8° (external 1.6° to   internal 6.6°) The cement mantle did not show any sign of migration   or loosening in relation to the femoral bone. There were no clinical   or radiological signs indicating that the migration or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">rotat</span></strong>ion   within the cement mantle had had any adverse effects for the patients.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2014;96-B:604–8.</p>

Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is a rare form of congenital heart disease. This study describes current surgical treatment strategies and experiences in a cohort of patients from 2 congenital cardiac centers in Shanghai and Guangdong in China.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This retrospective study included 768 patients operated on between 2005 and 2014. Although most patients (n=690) underwent conventional repair, a sutureless technique was used in 10% (n=78) of cases. A multilevel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed-effects parametric survival model and a competing-risk analysis were used to analyze associated risk factors for death and recurrent pulmonary venous obstruction (PVO), respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze the overall survival. The Nelson-Aalen cumulative risk curve was used to compare distributions of time with recurrent PVO.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The mean surgical age and weight were 214.9±39.2 days and 5.4±3.6 kg, respectively. Obstructed TAPVC (PVO) was documented in 192 (25%) of the 768 patients. There were 38 intraoperative deaths and 13 late deaths. A younger age at the time of repair (<i>P</i>=0.001), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed (<i>P</i>=0.004) and infracardiac (<i>P</i>=0.035) TAPVC, preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.027), prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001), and longer duration of ventilation (<i>P</i>=0.028) were associated with mortality. The median follow-up was 23.2 months (range; 1–112 months). Among the 717 survivors, recurrent PVO was observed in 111 patients (15%). Associated risk factors for recurrent PVO included preoperative PVO (<i>P</i><0.001), infracardiac TAPVC (<i>P</i><0.001), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed TAPVC (<i>P</i>=0.013), and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time (<i>P</i><0.001). Sutureless technique was associated with a lower restenosis rate compared with conventional repair in patients with preoperative PVO (<i>P</i>=0.038), except in newborn patients (<i>P</i>=0.443). Reintervention for restenosis was performed in 24 patients. The function of most survivors (91%) was classified according to the New York Heart Association as functional class I or II.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Surgical correction in patients with TAPVC with a biventricular anatomy can achieve an acceptable outcome. Risk factors such as a younger age at the time of repair, infracardiac and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed TAPVC, and preoperative PVO were associated with a poorer prognosis.</p></sec>

Patients With Long-QT Syndrome Caused by Impaired <i>hERG</i>-Encoded K<sub>v</sub>11.1 Potassium Channel Have Exaggerated Endocrine Pancreatic and Incretin Function Associated With Reactive Hypoglycemia
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Loss-of-function mutations in <i>hERG</i> (encoding the K<sub>v</sub>11.1 voltage-gated potassium channel) cause long-QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) because of prolonged cardiac repolarization. However, K<sub>v</sub>11.1 is also present in pancreatic α and β cells and intestinal L and K cells, secreting glucagon, insulin, and the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide), respectively. These hormones are crucial for glucose regulation, and long-QT syndrome may cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disturb</span></strong>ed glucose regulation. We measured secretion of these hormones and cardiac repolarization in response to glucose ingestion in LQT2 patients with functional mutations in <i>hERG</i> and matched healthy participants, testing the hypothesis that LQT2 patients have increased incretin and β-cell function and decreased α-cell function, and thus lower glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Eleven patients with LQT2 and 22 sex-, age-, and body mass index–matched control participants underwent a 6-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with ECG recording and blood sampling for measurements of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GLP-1, and GIP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In comparison with matched control participants, LQT2 patients had 56% to 78% increased serum insulin, serum C-peptide, plasma GLP-1, and plasma GIP responses (<i>P</i>=0.03–0.001) and decreased plasma glucose levels after glucose ingestion (<i>P</i>=0.02) with more symptoms of hypoglycemia (<i>P</i>=0.04). Sixty-three percent of LQT2 patients developed hypoglycemic plasma glucose levels (<70 mg/dL) versus 36% control participants (<i>P</i>=0.16), and 18% patients developed serious hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) versus none of the controls. LQT2 patients had defective glucagon responses to low glucose, <i>P</i>=0.008. β-Cell function (Insulin Secretion Sensitivity Index-2) was 2-fold higher in LQT2 patients than in controls (4398 [95% confidence interval, 2259–8562] versus 2156 [1961–3201], <i>P</i>=0.03). Pharmacological K<sub>v</sub>11.1 blockade (dofetilide) in rats had similar effect, and small interfering RNA inhibition of <i>hERG</i> in β and L cells increased insulin and GLP-1 secretion up to 50%. Glucose ingestion caused cardiac repolarization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disturb</span></strong>ances with increased QTc intervals in both patients and controls, but with a 122% greater increase in QTcF interval in LQT2 patients (<i>P</i>=0.004).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Besides a prolonged cardiac repolarization phase, LQT2 patients display increased GLP-1, GIP, and insulin secretion and defective glucagon secretion, causing decreased plasma glucose and thus increased risk of hypoglycemia. Furthermore, glucose ingestion increased QT interval and aggravated the cardiac repolarization <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">disturb</span></strong>ances in LQT2 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Ecological speciation of bacteriophage lambda in allopatry and sympatry
<p>Understanding the conditions that allow speciation to occur is difficult because most research has focused on either long-lived organisms or asexual microorganisms. We propagated bacteriophage λ, a virus with rapid generations and frequent recombination, on two <i>Escherichia coli</i> host genotypes that expressed either the LamB or OmpF receptor. When supplied with either single host (allopatry), phage λ improved its binding to the available receptor while losing its ability to use the alternative. When evolving on both hosts together (sympatry), the viruses split into two lineages with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ent receptor preferences. Although the level of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diverg</span></strong>ence varied among replicates, some lineages evolved reproductive isolation via genetic incompatibilities. This outcome indicates that, under suitable conditions, allopatric and sympatric speciation can occur with similar ease.</p>

Recovery of an Isolated Coral Reef System Following Severe Disturbance

Photochemical Route for Accessing Amorphous Metal Oxide Materials for Water Oxidation Catalysis
<sec><title>Amorphous and More Active</title><p>The electrochemical generation of hydrogen from water could help in the storage of energy generated by renewable resources at off-peak times. However, catalysts for the slow step of this reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), are based on oxides of noble metals (iridium and ruthenium) that have limited abundance. A strategy for improving the performance of earth-abundant elements is to explore <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed-metal oxides and to prepare these as amorphous phases. <bold>Smith <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 60, published online 28 March) developed a general method for preparing amorphous oxides, based on photodecomposition of organometallic precursors. Amorphous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mix</span></strong>ed-metal oxides of iron, nickel, and cobalt were more active than comparable crystalline materials and provided OER performance comparable to noble metal oxides.</p></sec>

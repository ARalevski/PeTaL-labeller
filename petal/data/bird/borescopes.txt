Long-term outcome of carpal tunnel release surgery in patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Few studies have examined the long-term outcome of carpal tunnel   release (CTR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient-reported   long-term outcome of CTR for electrophysiologically severe carpal   tunnel syndrome (CTS).</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We reviewed the long-term outcome of 40 patients with bilateral   severe CTS who underwent 80 CTRs (46 open, 34 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endoscop</span></strong>ic) between   2002 and 2012. The outcomes studied were patient-reported outcomes   of numbness resolution, the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ)   score, and patient satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean follow-up was 9.3 years. Complete resolution of numbness   was reported by 93.8% of patients, persistent numbness by 3.8%,   and recurrent numbness by 2.5%. The mean BCTQ symptom score was   1.1 (<sc>sd</sc> 0.3; 1.0 to 2.55) and the mean Boston function   score was 1.15 (<sc>sd</sc> 0.46; 1.0 to 3.5). 72.5% of patients   were asymptomatic and had no functional impairment. Men had poorer   outcomes than women and patients < 55 years had poorer outcomes   than patients ≥ 55 years. All patients who had undergone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endoscop</span></strong>ic   CTR reported complete resolution of numbness compared with 89.1%   of those who had undergone open release (p = 0.047). There was no   significant difference in outcome between dominant and non-dominant   hands. Patient satisfaction rates were good. There were no adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CTR has a favourable outcome and good rates of satisfaction,   even in patients with bilateral severe CTS at a mean of nine years   after surgery. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endoscop</span></strong>ic CTR has a higher rate of numbness resolution   than open surgery. There were no significant differences in outcome   between the dominant and non-dominant hand.</p><p>Cite this article: <i>Bone Joint J</i> 2017;99-B:1348–53.</p></sec>

Study Comparing Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes in Open Vein Harvesting and 2 Types of Endoscopic Vein Harvesting for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Current consensus statements maintain that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endoscop</span></strong>ic vein harvesting (EVH) should be standard care in coronary artery bypass graft surgery, but vein quality and clinical outcomes have been questioned. The VICO trial (Vein Integrity and Clinical Outcomes) was designed to assess the impact of different vein harvesting methods on vessel damage and whether this contributes to clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center, randomized clinical trial, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with an internal mammary artery and with 1 to 4 vein grafts were recruited. All veins were harvested by a single experienced practitioner. We randomly allocated 300 patients into closed tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), open tunnel CO<sub>2</sub> EVH (n=100), and traditional open vein harvesting (n=100) groups. The primary end point was endothelial integrity and muscular damage of the harvested vein. Secondary end points included clinical outcomes (major adverse cardiac events), use of healthcare resources, and impact on health status (quality-adjusted life-years).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The open vein harvesting group demonstrated marginally better endothelial integrity in random samples (85% versus 88% versus 93% for closed tunnel EVH, open tunnel EVH, and open vein harvesting; <i>P</i><0.001). Closed tunnel EVH displayed the lowest longitudinal hypertrophy (1% versus 13.5% versus 3%; <i>P</i>=0.001). However, no differences in endothelial stretching were observed between groups (37% versus 37% versus 31%; <i>P</i>=0.62). Secondary clinical outcomes demonstrated no significant differences in composite major adverse cardiac event scores at each time point up to 48 months. The quality-adjusted life-year gain per patient was 0.11 (<i>P</i><0.001) for closed tunnel EVH and 0.07 (<i>P</i>=0.003) for open tunnel EVH compared with open vein harvesting. The likelihood of being cost-effective, at a predefined threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, was 75% for closed tunnel EVH, 19% for open tunnel EVH, and 6% for open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that harvesting techniques affect the integrity of different vein layers, albeit only slightly. Secondary outcomes suggest that histological findings do not directly contribute to major adverse cardiac event outcomes. Gains in health status were observed, and cost-effectiveness was better with closed tunnel EVH. High-level experience with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">endoscop</span></strong>ic harvesting performed by a dedicated specialist practitioner gives optimal results comparable to those of open vein harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>https://www.isrctn.com</ext-link>.

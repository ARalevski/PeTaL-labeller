Genome sequence of <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314
<p>Awamori is a traditional distilled beverage made from steamed Thai-Indica rice in Okinawa, Japan. For brewing the liquor, two microbes, local kuro (black) koji <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong> <i>Aspergillus luchuensis</i> and awamori <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> are involved. In contrast, that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>s are used for ethanol fermentation throughout the world, a characteristic of Japanese fermentation industries is the use of <i>Aspergillus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>s as a source of enzymes for the maceration and saccharification of raw materials. Here we report the draft genome of a kuro (black) koji <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>, <i>A. luchuensis</i> NBRC 4314 (RIB 2604). The total length of nonredundant sequences was nearly 34.7 Mb, comprising approximately 2,300 contigs with 16 telomere-like sequences. In total, 11,691 genes were predicted to encode proteins. Most of the housekeeping genes, such as transcription factors and <i>N</i>-and <i>O</i>-glycosylation system, were conserved with respect to <i>Aspergillus niger</i> and <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>. An alternative oxidase and acid-stable α-amylase regarding citric acid production and fermentation at a low pH as well as a unique glutamic peptidase were also found in the genome. Furthermore, key biosynthetic gene clusters of ochratoxin A and fumonisin B were absent when compared with <i>A. niger</i> genome, showing the safety of <i>A. luchuensis</i> for food and beverage production. This genome information will facilitate not only comparative genomics with industrial kuro-koji <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>s, but also molecular breeding of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong>s in improvements of awamori fermentation.</p>

Role of Glycosyltransferases in Pollen Wall Primexine Formation and Exine Patterning
<p>The pollen cell wall is important for protection of male sperm from physical stresses and consists of an inner gametophyte-derived intine layer and a sporophyte-derived exine layer. The polymeric constituents of the robust exine are termed sporopollenin. The mechanisms by which sporopollenin is anchored onto <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es and polymerized in specific patterns are unknown, but the primexine, a transient cell wall matrix formed on the surface of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es at the late tetrad stage, is hypothesized to play a key role. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>spongy</i> (<i>spg</i>) and <i>uneven pattern of exine</i> (<i>upex</i>) mutants exhibit defective and irregular exine patterns. <i>SPG2</i> (synonymous with <i>IRREGULAR XYLEM9-LIKE</i> [<i>IRX9L</i>]) encodes a family GT43 glycosyltransferase involved in xylan backbone biosynthesis, while <i>UPEX1</i> encodes a family GT31 glycosyltransferase likely involved in galactosylation of arabinogalactan proteins. Imaging of developing <i>irx9l</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es showed that the earliest detectable defect was in primexine formation. Furthermore, wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es contained primexine-localized epitopes indicative of the presence of xylan, but these were absent in <i>irx9l</i>. These data, together with the <i>spg</i> phenotype of a mutant in <i>IRX14L</i>, which also plays a role in xylan backbone elongation, indicate the presence of xylan in pollen wall primexine, which plays a role in exine patterning on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>e surface. We observed an aberrant primexine and irregular patterns of incipient sporopollenin deposition in <i>upex1</i>, suggesting that primexine-localized arabinogalactan proteins could play roles in sporopollenin adhesion and patterning early in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>e wall development. Our data provide new insights into the biochemical and functional properties of the primexine component of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>e cell wall.</p>

If two deletions don't stop growth, try three
<p>How many and which genes does an organism need at a minimum to sustain growth? With the identification of essential genes in a variety of organisms such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> (<i>1</i>), worms (<i>2</i>), and human cultured cells (<i>3</i>–<i>5</i>), the answer may seem obvious: Remove all nonessential genes, and the organism should be able to continue to survive and grow. In the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, the workhorse of genetic interaction mapping, ∼1000 of the ∼6000 (∼17%) protein-coding genes are essential for viability (<i>1</i>). So theoretically, one might think that one could remove the other ∼5000 nonessential genes and still have a growing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>. The reason this does not work is that genes interact with each other to drive different traits, including viability and growth. On page 283 of this issue, Kuzmin <i>et al.</i> (<i>6</i>) provide the first systematic analysis of trigenic interactions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> in which three gene deletions are combined in individual strains in order to ascertain the importance of multigene interactions for growth. This study shows that higher-order genetic interactions are abundant, which has implications for the interpretation of human gene variants that may interact to affect health and disease.</p>

Gibberellin Acts Positively Then Negatively to Control Onset of Flower Formation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>
<sec><title>One Hormone, Two Phases</title><p>The switch from vegetative growth to flowering in the plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> involves two phases—inflorescence branching and flowering. <bold>Yamaguchi <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 638) examined how the phytohormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gibberellin</span></strong> regulates each phase differently. First, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gibberellin</span></strong> levels increase and stimulate production of key flowering factors, one of which degrades <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gibberellin</span></strong>.

Natural Variation of Molecular and Morphological Gibberellin Responses
<p>Although phytohormones such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gibberellin</span></strong>s are essential for many conserved aspects of plant physiology and development, plants vary greatly in their responses to these regulatory compounds. Here, we use genetic perturbation of endogenous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gibberellin</span></strong> levels to probe the extent of intraspecific variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gibberellin</span></strong> responses in natural accessions of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>).

OsATX1 Interacts with Heavy Metal P1B-Type ATPases and Affects Copper Transport and Distribution
<p>Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Cu trafficking and distribution to different organs in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we report the function and role of Antioxidant Protein1 (OsATX1), a Cu chaperone in rice. Knocking out <i>OsATX1</i> resulted in increased Cu concentrations in roots, whereas <i>OsATX1</i> overexpression reduced root Cu concentrations but increased Cu accumulation in the shoots. At the reproductive stage, the concentrations of Cu in developing tissues, including panicles, upper nodes and internodes, younger leaf blades, and leaf sheaths of the main tiller, were increased significantly in <i>OsATX1</i>-overexpressing plants and decreased in <i>osatx1</i> mutants compared with the wild type. The <i>osatx1</i> mutants also showed a higher Cu concentration in older leaves. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsATX1 interacts with the rice heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases HMA4, HMA5, HMA6, and HMA9. These results suggest that OsATX1 may function to deliver Cu to heavy metal P<sub>1B</sub>-ATPases for Cu trafficking and distribution in order to maintain Cu homeostasis in different rice tissues. In addition, heterologous expression of <i>OsATX1</i> in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) cadmium-sensitive mutant Δ<i>ycf1</i> increased the tolerance to Cu and cadmium by decreasing their respective concentrations in the transformed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> cells. Taken together, our results indicate that OsATX1 plays an important role in facilitating root-to-shoot Cu translocation and the redistribution of Cu from old leaves to developing tissues and seeds in rice.</p>

Vacuolar Trafficking Protein VPS38 Is Dispensable for Autophagy
<p>Phosphatidylinositol 3-P (PI3P) is a signaling molecule that controls a variety of processes in endosomal, autophagic, and vacuolar/lysosomal trafficking in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>s and mammals. Vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34) is a conserved PI3K present in multiple complexes with specific functions and regulation. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>, the PI3K complex II consists of Vps34p, Vps15p, Vps30p/Atg6p, and Vps38p, and is essential for vacuolar protein sorting. Here, we describe the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homolog of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> Vps38p and human UV radiation resistance-associated gene protein. Arabidopsis VPS38 interacts with VPS30/ATG6 both in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> and in planta. Although the level of PI3P in Arabidopsis <i>vps38</i> mutants is similar to that in wild type, <i>vps38</i> cells contain enlarged multivesicular endosomes and fewer organelles enriched in PI3P than the wild type. The <i>vps38</i> mutants are defective in the trafficking of vacuolar cargo and its receptor VACUOLAR SORTING RECEPTOR2;1. The mutants also exhibit abnormal cytoplasmic distributions of endocytic cargo, such as auxin efflux carriers PINFORMED1 (PIN1) and PIN2. Constitutive autophagy is normal in the mutants but starvation-induced autophagy was slightly inhibited. We conclude that Arabidopsis VPS38 is dispensable for autophagy but essential for efficient targeting of biosynthetic and endocytic cargo to the vacuole.</p>

Hornwort Stomata: Architecture and Fate Shared with 400-Million-Year-Old Fossil Plants without Leaves
<p>As one of the earliest plant groups to evolve stomata, hornworts are key to understanding the origin and function of stomata. Hornwort stomata are large and scattered on sporangia that grow from their bases and release <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spore</span></strong>s at their tips. We present data from development and immunocytochemistry that identify a role for hornwort stomata that is correlated with sporangial and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spore</span></strong> maturation. We measured guard cells across the genera with stomata to assess developmental changes in size and to analyze any correlation with genome size. Stomata form at the base of the sporophyte in the green region, where they develop differential wall thickenings, form a pore, and die. Guard cells collapse inwardly, increase in surface area, and remain perched over a substomatal cavity and network of intercellular spaces that is initially fluid filled. Following pore formation, the sporophyte dries from the outside inwardly and continues to do so after guard cells die and collapse. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spore</span></strong> tetrads develop in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spore</span></strong> mother cell walls within a mucilaginous matrix, both of which progressively dry before sporophyte dehiscence. A lack of correlation between guard cell size and DNA content, lack of arabinans in cell walls, and perpetually open pores are consistent with the inactivity of hornwort stomata. Stomata are expendable in hornworts, as they have been lost twice in derived taxa. Guard cells and epidermal cells of hornworts show striking similarities with the earliest plant fossils. Our findings identify an architecture and fate of stomata in hornworts that is ancient and common to plants without sporophytic leaves.</p>

A <i>β</i>-Ketoacyl-CoA Synthase Is Involved in Rice Leaf Cuticular Wax Synthesis and Requires a CER2-LIKE Protein as a Cofactor
<p>Cuticular waxes are complex mixtures of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, forming a natural barrier on aerial surfaces of terrestrial plants against biotic and abiotic stresses. In VLCFA biosynthesis, β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) is the key enzyme, catalyzing the first reaction in fatty acid elongation and determining substrate specificity. We isolated a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) <i>wax crystal-sparse leaf 4</i> (<i>WSL4</i>) gene using a map-based cloning strategy. <i>WSL4</i> is predicted to encode a KCS, a homolog of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) CER6. Complementation of the mutant <i>wsl4-1</i> with <i>WSL4</i> genomic DNA rescued the cuticular wax-deficient phenotype, confirming the function of <i>WSL4</i>. The load of wax components longer than 30 carbons (C30) and C28 were reduced markedly in <i>wsl4-1</i> and <i>wsl4-2</i> mutants, respectively. Overexpression of <i>WSL4</i> increased the cuticular wax load in rice leaves. We further isolated a cofactor of WSL4, OsCER2, a homolog of Arabidopsis CER2, by coimmunoprecipitation and confirmed their physical interaction by split-ubiquitin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> two-hybrid experiments. Expression of <i>WSL4</i> alone in <i>elo3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> cells resulted in increased C24 but did not produce VLCFAs of greater length, whereas expressing <i>OsCER2</i> alone showed no effect. Coexpression of <i>WSL4</i> and <i>OsCER2</i> in <i>elo3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> cells yielded fatty acids up to C30. OsCER2 with a mutated HxxxD motif (H172E, D176A, and D176H) interrupted its interaction with WSL4 and failed to elongate VLCFAs past C24 when expressed with WSL4 in <i>elo3</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> cells. These results demonstrated that WSL4 was involved in VLCFA elongation beyond C22 and that elongation beyond C24 required the participation of OsCER2.</p>

Heterochronic Meiotic Misexpression in an Interspecific Yeast Hybrid
<p>Regulatory changes rapidly accumulate between species, and interspecific hybrids often misexpress genes. Hybrid misexpression, expression levels outside the range of both parental species, can result from <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-acting regulatory changes that interact abnormally in hybrids. Thus, misexpressed genes may contribute to hybrid sterility. However, in the context of a whole organism, misexpression may not result directly from <i>cis–trans</i> interactions but rather indirectly from differences between hybrid and parental abundance of cell types. Here we eliminate the confounding effects of cell types by examining gene expression in a sterile interspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> hybrid during meiosis. We investigated gene expression of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>s <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, <i>S. paradoxus</i>, and their hybrid at multiple meiotic stages. Although the hybrid and parents exhibit similar changes in expression levels across meiosis, the hybrid meiotic program occurs earlier than either parent. The timing change produces a heterochronic pattern of misexpression during midmeiosis. Coincident with the timing of misexpression, we find a transition from predominantly <i>trans</i>-acting to <i>cis-</i>acting expression divergence and an increase in the number of opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes. However, we find no direct relationship between opposing <i>cis–trans</i> changes and misexpression. Contrary to the notion that <i>cis–trans</i> interactions cause misexpression, a heterochronic shift in the normal meiotic gene expression program produces patterns of misexpression in an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> hybrid. Our results imply that temporal dynamics of single cell types is important to understanding hybrid misexpression and its relationship to <i>cis–trans</i> interactions.</p>

Phase separation of a yeast prion protein promotes cellular fitness
<p>Despite the important role of prion domains in neurodegenerative disease, their physiological function has remained enigmatic. Previous work with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> prions has defined prion domains as sequences that form self-propagating aggregates. Here, we uncovered an unexpected function of the canonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> prion protein Sup35. In stressed conditions, Sup35 formed protective gels via pH-regulated liquid-like phase separation followed by gelation. Phase separation was mediated by the N-terminal prion domain and regulated by the adjacent pH sensor domain. Phase separation promoted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> cell survival by rescuing the essential Sup35 translation factor from stress-induced damage. Thus, prion-like domains represent conserved environmental stress sensors that facilitate rapid adaptation in unstable environments by modifying protein phase behavior.</p>

Sterilizing immunity in the lung relies on targeting fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death
<p>Humans inhale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong> conidia daily and typically experience lifelong asymptomatic clearance. Conidial germination into tissue-invasive hyphae can occur in individuals with defects in myeloid function, although the mechanism of myeloid cell–mediated immune surveillance remains unclear. By monitoring fungal physiology in vivo, we demonstrate that lung neutrophils trigger programmed cell death with apoptosis-like features in <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> conidia, the most prevalent human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mold</span></strong> pathogen. An antiapoptotic protein, AfBIR1, opposes this process by inhibiting fungal caspase activation and DNA fragmentation in the murine lung. Genetic and pharmacologic studies indicate that AfBIR1 expression and activity underlie conidial susceptibility to NADPH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase-dependent killing and, in turn, host susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis. Immune surveillance exploits a fungal apoptosis-like programmed cell death pathway to maintain sterilizing immunity in the lung.</p>

SynXII was assembled using a two-step method, specified by successive megachunk integration and meiotic recombination-mediated assembly, producing a functional chromosome in <i>S. cerevisiae.</i> Minor growth defect “bugs” detected in synXII, caused by deletion of tRNA genes, were rescued by introducing an ectopic copy of a single tRNA gene. The ribosomal gene cluster (rDNA) on synXII was left intact during the assembly process and subsequently replaced by a modified rDNA unit used to regenerate rDNA at three distinct chromosomal locations. The signature sequences within rDNA, which can be used to determine species identity, were swapped to generate a <i>Saccharomyces</i> synXII strain that would be identified as <i>Saccharomyces bayanus</i> by standard DNA barcoding procedures.</p>

Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carriers Prevent Cadmium Toxicity by Sustaining the TCA Cycle and Glutathione Synthesis
<p>Cadmium (Cd) is a major heavy metal pollutant, and Cd toxicity is a serious cause of abiotic stress in the environment. Plants protect themselves against Cd stress through a variety of pathways. In a recent study, we found that mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (MPCs) are involved in Cd tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Following the identification of MPCs in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) in 2012, most studies have focused on the function of MPCs in animals, as a possible approach to reduce the risk of cancer developing. The results of this study show that AtMPC protein complexes are required for Cd tolerance and prevention of Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis. AtMPC complexes are composed of two elements, AtMPC1 and AtMPC2 (AtNRGA1 or AtMPC3). When the formation of AtMPCs was interrupted by the loss of <i>AtMPC1</i>, glutamate could supplement the synthesis of acetyl-coenzyme A and sustain the TCA cycle. With the up-regulation of glutathione synthesis following exposure to Cd stress, the supplementary pathway could not efficiently drive the tricarboxylic acid cycle without AtMPC. The ATP content decreased concomitantly with the deletion of tricarboxylic acid activity, which led to Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis. More importantly, ScMPCs were also required for Cd tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>. Our results suggest that the mechanism of Cd tolerance may be similar in other species.</p>

High-CO<sub>2</sub>/Hypoxia-Responsive Transcription Factors DkERF24 and DkWRKY1 Interact and Activate <i>DkPDC2</i> Promoter
<p>Identification and functional characterization of hypoxia-responsive transcription factors is important for understanding plant responses to natural anaerobic environments and during storage and transport of fresh horticultural products. In this study, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> one-hybrid library screening using the persimmon (<i>Diospyros kaki</i>) pyruvate decarboxylase (<i>DkPDC2</i>) promoter identified three ethylene response factor (ERF) genes (<i>DkERF23</i>/<i>DkERF24</i>/<i>DkERF25</i>) and four WRKY transcription factor genes (<i>DkWRKY/DdkWRKY5</i>/<i>DkWRKY6</i>/<i>DkWRKY7</i>) that were differentially expressed in response to high CO<sub>2</sub> (95%, with 4% N<sub>2</sub> and 1% oxygen) and high N<sub>2</sub> (99% N<sub>2</sub> and 1% oxygen). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> one-hybrid assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that DkERF23, DkERF24, DkERF25, DkWRKY6, and DkWRKY7 could directly bind to the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. Dual-luciferase assays confirmed that these transcription factors were capable of transactivating the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. DkERF24 and DkWRKY1 in combination synergistically transactivated the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed protein–protein interaction between DkERF24 and DkWRKY1. Transient overexpression of <i>DkERF24</i> and <i>DkWRKY1</i> separately and in combination in persimmon fruit discs was effective in maintaining insolubilization of tannins, concomitantly with the accumulation of DkPDC2 transcripts. Studies with Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) homologs <i>AtERF1</i> and <i>AtWRKY53</i> indicated that similar protein–protein interactions and synergistic regulatory effects also occur with the <i>DkPDC2</i> promoter. We propose that an ERF and WRKY transcription factor complex contributes to responses to hypoxia in both persimmon fruit and Arabidopsis, and the possibility that this is a general plant response requires further investigation.</p>

Protein Phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β Protect Centromeric Cohesion during Meiosis I
<p>During meiosis, the stepwise release of sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for the equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells, enabling generation of fertile gametophytes. However, the molecular mechanism that protects centromeric cohesion from release at meiosis I is unclear in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Here, we report that the protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunits B'α and B'β participate in the control of sister chromatid separation. The double mutant <i>b'αβ</i> exhibited severe male and female sterility, caused by the lack of a nucleus or presence of an abnormal nucleus in mature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es and embryo sacs. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining revealed unequal amounts of DNA in the mononuclear <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es. Transverse sections of the anthers revealed unevenly sized tetrads with or without a nucleus, suggesting a defect in meiocyte meiosis. An analysis of chromosome spreads showed that the sister chromatids separated prematurely at anaphase I in <i>b'αβ</i>. Immunoblotting showed that AtRECOMBINATION DEFECTIVE8 (AtREC8), a key member of the cohesin complex, was hyperphosphorylated in <i>b'αβ</i> anthers and pistils during meiosis but hypophosphorylated in the wild type. Furthermore, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that B'α and B'β interact specifically with AtREC8, AtSHUGOSHIN1 (AtSGO1), AtSGO2, and PATRONUS1. Given that B'α was reported to localize to the centromere in meiotic cells, we propose that protein phosphatase 2A B'α and B'β are recruited by AtSGO1/2 and PATRONUS1 to dephosphorylate AtREC8 at the site of centromere cohesion to shield it from cleavage until anaphase II, contributing to the balanced separation of sister chromatids at meiosis.</p>

The Wheat <i>Lr67</i> Gene from the Sugar Transport Protein 13 Family Confers Multipathogen Resistance in Barley
<p>Fungal pathogens are a major constraint to global crop production; hence, plant genes encoding pathogen resistance are important tools for combating disease. A few resistance genes identified to date provide partial, durable resistance to multiple pathogens and the wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and resistant alleles – G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The barley ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> as a high affinity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by ∼ 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> was reduced when coexpressed with <i>Lr67res</i>. Stable transgenic <i>Lr67res</i> barley lines exhibited seedling resistance to the barley-specific pathogens <i>Puccinia hordei</i> and <i>Blumeria graminis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i>, which cause leaf rust and powdery mildew, respectively. Barley plants expressing <i>Lr67res</i> exhibited early senescence and higher pathogenesis-related (<i>PR</i>) gene expression. Unlike previous observations implicating flavonoids in the resistance of transgenic sorghum (<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>) expressing <i>Lr34res</i>, another wheat multipathogen resistance gene, barley flavonoids are unlikely to have a role in Lr67res-mediated resistance. Similar to observations made in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>, Lr67res reduced Glc uptake <i>in planta</i>. These results confirm that the pathway by which <i>Lr67res</i> confers resistance to fungal pathogens is conserved between wheat and barley.</p>

An ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR-MYB Transcription Complex Regulates Furaneol Biosynthesis by Activating <i>QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE</i> Expression in Strawberry
<p>4-Hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone is a major contributor to the aroma of strawberry (<i>Fragaria</i> × <i>ananassa</i>) fruit, and the last step in its biosynthesis is catalyzed by strawberry quinone oxidoreductase (FaQR). Here, an ethylene response factor (FaERF#9) was characterized as a positive regulator of the <i>FaQR</i> promoter. Linear regression analysis indicated that <i>FaERF#9</i> transcript levels were correlated significantly with both <i>FaQR</i> transcripts and furanone content in different strawberry cultivars. Transient overexpression of <i>FaERF#9</i> in strawberry fruit significantly increased <i>FaQR</i> expression and furaneol production. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> one-hybrid assays, however, indicated that FaERF#9 by itself did not bind to the <i>FaQR</i> promoter. An MYB transcription factor (FaMYB98) identified in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> one-hybrid screening of the strawberry cDNA library was capable of both binding to the promoter and activating the transcription of <i>FaQR</i> by ∼5.6-fold. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation confirmed a direct protein-protein interaction between FaERF#9 and FaMYB98, and in combination, they activated the <i>FaQR</i> promoter 14-fold in transactivation assays. These results indicate that an ERF-MYB complex containing FaERF#9 and FaMYB98 activates the <i>FaQR</i> promoter and up-regulates 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone biosynthesis in strawberry.</p>

The Potato MAP3K StVIK Is Required for the <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> RXLR Effector Pi17316 to Promote Disease
<p>Plant pathogens deliver effectors to manipulate processes in their hosts, creating a suitable environment for invasion and proliferation. Yet, little is known about the host proteins that are targeted by effectors from filamentous pathogens. Here, we show that stable transgenic expression in potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>) and transient expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> of the arginine-any amino acid-leucine-arginine effector Pi17316 enhances leaf colonization by the late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blight</span></strong> pathogen <i>Phytophthora infestans</i>. Expression of Pi17316 also attenuates cell death triggered by the pathogen-associated molecular pattern Infestin1 (INF1), indicating that the effector suppresses pattern-triggered immunity. However, this effector does not attenuate cell death triggered by a range of resistance proteins, showing that it specifically suppresses INF1-triggered cell death (ICD). In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> two-hybrid assays, Pi17316 interacts directly with the potato ortholog of VASCULAR HIGHWAY1-interacting kinase (StVIK), encoding a predicted MEK kinase (MAP3K). Interaction in planta was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and occurs at the plant plasma membrane. Virus-induced gene silencing of <i>VIK</i> in <i>N. benthamiana</i> attenuated <i>P. infestans</i> colonization, whereas transient overexpression of <i>StVIK</i> enhanced colonization, indicating that this host protein acts as a susceptibility factor. Moreover, <i>VIK</i> overexpression specifically attenuated ICD, indicating that it is a negative regulator of immunity. The abilities of Pi17316 to enhance <i>P. infestans</i> colonization or suppress ICD were compromised significantly in <i>NbVIK</i>-silenced plants, demonstrating that the effector activity of Pi17316 is mediated by this MAP3K. Thus, StVIK is exploited by <i>P. infestans</i> as a susceptibility factor to promote late <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">blight</span></strong> disease.</p>

The GET System Inserts the Tail-Anchored Protein, SYP72, into Endoplasmic Reticulum Membranes
<p>The Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) genome encodes homologs of the Guided Entry of Tail (GET)-anchored protein system for the posttranslational insertion of tail-anchored (TA) proteins into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>, TA proteins are loaded onto the cytosolic targeting factor Get3 and are then delivered to the membrane-associated Get1/2 complex for insertion into ER membranes. The role of the GET system in Arabidopsis was investigated by monitoring the membrane insertion of a tail-anchored protein, SYP72, a syntaxin. SYP72 bound to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> Get3 in vitro, forming a Get3-SYP72 fusion complex that could be inserted into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> GET1/2-containing proteoliposomes. The Arabidopsis GET system functioned in vivo to insert TA proteins into ER membranes as demonstrated by the fact that the YFP-tagged SYP72 localized to the ER in wild-type plants but accumulated as cytoplasmic inclusions in <i>get1</i>, <i>get3</i>, or <i>get4</i> mutants. The GET mutants <i>get1</i> and <i>get3</i> were less tolerant of ER stress agents and showed symptoms of ER stress even under unstressed conditions. Hence, the GET system is responsible for the insertion of TA proteins into the ER in Arabidopsis, and mutants with GET dysfunctions are more susceptible to ER stress.</p>

“Perfect” designer chromosome V and behavior of a ring derivative
<p>Perfect matching of an assembled physical sequence to a specified designed sequence is crucial to verify design principles in genome synthesis. We designed and de novo synthesized 536,024–base pair chromosome synV in the “Build-A-Genome China” course. We corrected an initial isolate of synV to perfectly match the designed sequence using integrative cotransformation and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)–mediated editing in 22 steps; synV strains exhibit high fitness under a variety of culture conditions, compared with that of wild-type V strains. A ring synV derivative was constructed, which is fully functional in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> under all conditions tested and exhibits lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spore</span></strong> viability during meiosis. Ring synV chromosome can extends Sc2.0 design principles and provides a model with which to study genomic rearrangement, ring chromosome evolution, and human ring chromosome disorders.</p>

An N-end rule pathway that recognizes proline and destroys gluconeogenic enzymes
<p>Cells synthesize glucose if deprived of it, and destroy gluconeogenic enzymes upon return to glucose-replete conditions. We found that the Gid4 subunit of the ubiquitin ligase GID in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> targeted the gluconeogenic enzymes Fbp1, Icl1, and Mdh2 for degradation. Gid4 recognized the N-terminal proline (Pro) residue and the ~5-residue-long adjacent sequence motifs. Pck1, the fourth gluconeogenic enzyme, contains Pro at position 2; Gid4 directly or indirectly recognized Pro at position 2 of Pck1, contributing to its targeting. These and related results identified Gid4 as the recognition component of the GID-based proteolytic system termed the Pro/N-end rule pathway. Substrates of this pathway include gluconeogenic enzymes that bear either the N-terminal Pro residue or a Pro at position 2, together with adjacent sequence motifs.</p>

Architecture of the yeast small subunit processome

Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> SSU processome at 5.1-angstrom resolution.

The strategic placement of a molecular motor at the center of the particle further suggests a mechanism for mediating conformational changes within this giant particle.

Systems-level analysis of mechanisms regulating yeast metabolic flux
<p>Cellular metabolic fluxes are determined by enzyme activities and metabolite abundances. Biochemical approaches reveal the impact of specific substrates or regulators on enzyme kinetics but do not capture the extent to which metabolite and enzyme concentrations vary across physiological states and, therefore, how cellular reactions are regulated. We measured enzyme and metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes across 25 steady-state <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> cultures. We then assessed the extent to which flux can be explained by a Michaelis-Menten relationship between enzyme, substrate, product, and potential regulator concentrations. This revealed three previously unrecognized instances of cross-pathway regulation, which we biochemically verified. One of these involved inhibition of pyruvate kinase by citrate, which accumulated and thereby curtailed glycolytic outflow in nitrogen-limited <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>. Overall, substrate concentrations were the strongest driver of the net rates of cellular metabolic reactions, with metabolite concentrations collectively having more than double the physiological impact of enzymes.</p>

The AAA-ATPase MIDASIN 1 Functions in Ribosome Biogenesis and Is Essential for Embryo and Root Development
<p>Ribosome biogenesis is an orchestrated process that relies on many assembly factors. The AAA-ATPase Midasin 1 (Mdn1) functions as a ribosome assembly factor in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>), but the roles of MDN1 in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) are poorly understood. Here, we showed that the Arabidopsis null mutant of <i>MDN1</i> is embryo-lethal. Using the weak mutant <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i>, which maintains viability, we found that MDN1 is critical for the regular pattern of auxin maxima in the globular embryo and functions in root meristem maintenance. By detecting the subcellular distribution of ribosome proteins, we noted that <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> impairs nuclear export of the pre-60S ribosomal particle. The processing of ribosomal precusor RNAs, including 35S, 27SB, and 20S, is also affected in this mutant. MDN1 physically interacts with PESCADILLO2 (PES2), an essential assembly factor of the 60S ribosome, and the observed mislocalization of PES2 in <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> further implied that MDN1 plays an indispensable role in 60S ribosome biogenesis. Therefore, the observed hypersensitivity of <i>mdn1</i>-<i>1</i> to a eukaryotic translation inhibitor and high-sugar conditions might be associated with the defect in ribosome biogenesis. Overall, this work establishes a role of Arabidopsis MDN1 in ribosome biogenesis, which agrees with its roles in embryogenesis and root development.</p>

SlHY5 Integrates Temperature, Light, and Hormone Signaling to Balance Plant Growth and Cold Tolerance
<p>During the transition from warm to cool seasons, plants experience decreased temperatures, shortened days, and decreased red/far-red (R/FR) ratios of light. The mechanism by which plants integrate these environmental cues to maintain plant growth and adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we report that low temperature induced the transcription of <i>PHYTOCHROME A</i> and accumulation of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (SlHY5, a basic Leu zipper transcription factor) in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants, especially under short day conditions with low R/FR light ratios. Reverse genetic approaches and physiological analyses revealed that silencing of <i>SlHY5</i> increased cold susceptibility in tomato plants, whereas overexpression of <i>SlHY5</i> enhanced cold tolerance. SlHY5 directly bound to and activated the transcription of genes encoding a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gibberellin</span></strong>-inactivation enzyme, namely <i><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gibberellin</span></strong>2-OXIDASE4</i>, and an abscisic acid biosynthetic enzyme, namely <i>9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE6</i> (<i>SlNCED6</i>). Thus, phytochrome A-dependent SlHY5 accumulation resulted in an increased abscisic acid/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gibberellin</span></strong> ratio, which was accompanied by growth cessation and induction of cold response. Furthermore, silencing of <i>SlNCED6</i> compromises short day- and low R/FR-induced tomato resistance to cold stress. These findings provide insight into the molecular genetic mechanisms by which plants integrate environmental stimuli with hormones to coordinate their growth with impending cold temperatures. Moreover, this work reveals a molecular mechanism that plants have evolved for growth and survival in response to seasonal changes.</p>

OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation, and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes
<p>Plant roots rely on inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) transporters to acquire soluble Pi from soil solutions that exists at micromolar levels in natural ecosystems. Here, we functionally characterized a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) Pi transporter, Os Phosphate Transporter-1;3 (OsPHT1;3), that mediates Pi uptake, translocation, and remobilization. <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was directly regulated by Os Phosphate Starvation Response-2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades. OsPHT1;3 was able to complement a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> mutant strain defective in five Pi transporters and mediate Pi influx in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. Overexpression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots. However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members that facilitate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation only when external Pi concentration was below 5 μ<sc>m</sc>. Moreover, in basal nodes, the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was restricted to the phloem of regular vascular bundles and enlarged vascular bundles. An isotope labeling experiment with <sup>32</sup>P showed that <i>ospht1</i>;<i>3</i> mutant lines were impaired in remobilization of Pi from source to sink leaves. Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>2</i> and several other <i>OsPHT1</i> genes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated a physical interaction between OsPHT1;3 and OsPHT1;2. Taken together, our results indicate that OsPHT1;3 acts as a crucial factor for Pi acquisition, root-to-shoot Pi translocation, and redistribution of phosphorus in plants growing in environments with extremely low Pi levels.</p>

Inhibition of TOR Represses Nutrient Consumption, Which Improves Greening after Extended Periods of Etiolation
<p>Upon illumination, etiolated seedlings experience a transition from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic growth. During this process, the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway provides chlorophyll for photosynthesis. This pathway has to be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of photoreactive metabolites and to provide stoichiometric amounts of chlorophyll for its incorporation into photosynthetic protein complexes. Therefore, plants have evolved regulatory mechanisms to synchronize the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and chlorophyll-binding proteins. Two phytochrome-interacting factors (PIF1 and PIF3) and the DELLA proteins, which are controlled by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gibberellin</span></strong> pathway, are key regulators of this process. Here, we show that impairment of TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) activity in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), either by mutation of the TOR complex component <i>RAPTOR1B</i> or by treatment with TOR inhibitors, leads to a significantly reduced accumulation of the photoreactive chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide in darkness but an increased greening rate of etiolated seedlings after exposure to light. Detailed profiling of metabolic, transcriptomic, and physiological parameters revealed that the TOR-repressed lines not only grow slower, they grow in a nutrient-saving mode, which allows them to resist longer periods of low nutrient availability. Our results also indicated that <i>RAPTOR1B</i> acts upstream of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gibberellin</span></strong>-DELLA pathway and its mutation complements the repressed greening phenotype of <i>pif1</i> and <i>pif3</i> after etiolation.</p>

OsDER1 Is an ER-Associated Protein Degradation Factor That Responds to ER Stress
<p>Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) plays an important role in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control. To date, little is known about the retrotranslocation machinery in the plant ERAD pathway. We obtained a DERLIN-like protein (OsDER1) through a SWATH-based quantitative proteomic analysis of ER membrane proteins extracted from ER-stressed rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) seeds. OsDER1, a homolog of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> and mammal DER1, is localized in the ER and accumulates significantly under ER stress. Overexpression or suppression of OsDER1 in rice leads to activation of the unfolded protein response and hypersensitivity to ER stress, and suppression results in floury, shrunken seeds. In addition, the expression levels of polyubiquitinated proteins increased markedly in <i>OsDER1</i> overexpression or suppression transgenic rice. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that OsDER1 interacted with OsHRD1, OsHRD3, and OsCDC48, the essential components of the canonical ERAD pathway. Furthermore, OsDER1 associated with the signal peptide peptidase, a homolog of a component of the alternative ERAD pathway identified recently in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> and mammals.

Arabidopsis <i>VAC14</i> Is Critical for Pollen Development through Mediating Vacuolar Organization

Mutations in <i>FAB1A</i> to <i>FAB1D</i>, the genes encoding phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>]-converting kinases, are male gametophyte lethal in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) due to defective vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I, suggesting a key role of the phospholipid in dynamic vacuolar organization. However, other genetic components that regulate the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> and its involvement in pollen germination and tube growth are unknown. Here, we identified and characterized Arabidopsis VAC14, a homolog of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> and metazoan VAC14s that are crucial for the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>. <i>VAC14</i> is constitutively expressed and highly present in developing pollen.

Ultrastructural studies showed that vacuolar fission after pollen mitosis I was compromised in <i>vac14</i> mutant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es, which led to pollen abortion. We further showed that inhibiting the production of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> or exogenous application of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> mimicked or rescued the pollen developmental defect of the <i>vac14</i> mutant, respectively. Genetic interference and pharmacological approaches suggested a role of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> in pollen germination and tube growth.

The Tomato Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase SlMPK1 Is as a Negative Regulator of the High-Temperature Stress Response
<p>High-temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits plant growth and development. MAPK cascades play key roles in plant growth and stress signaling, but their involvement in the HT stress response is poorly understood. Here, we describe a 47-kD MBP-phosphorylated protein (p47-MBPK) activated in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) leaves under HT and identify it as SlMPK1 by tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Silencing of <i>SlMPK1</i> in transgenic tomato plants resulted in enhanced tolerance to HT, while overexpression resulted in reduced tolerance. Proteomic analysis identified a set of proteins involved in antioxidant defense that are significantly more abundant in RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants than nontransgenic plants under HT stress. RNA interference-<i>SlMPK1</i> plants also showed changes in membrane lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> two-hybrid screening, we identified a serine-proline-rich protein homolog, SlSPRH1, which interacts with SlMPK1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>, in plant cells, and in vitro. We demonstrate that SlMPK1 can directly phosphorylate SlSPRH1. Furthermore, the serine residue serine-44 of SlSPRH1 is a crucial phosphorylation site in the SlMPK1-mediated antioxidant defense mechanism activated during HT stress. We also demonstrate that heterologous expression of <i>SlSPRH1</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) led to a decrease in thermotolerance and lower antioxidant capacity. Taken together, our results suggest that SlMPK1 is a negative regulator of thermotolerance in tomato plants. SlMPK1 acts by regulating antioxidant defense, and its substrate SlSPRH1 is involved in this pathway.</p>

The OsFBK1 E3 Ligase Subunit Affects Anther and Root Secondary Cell Wall Thickenings by Mediating Turnover of a Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductase
<p>Regulated proteolysis by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system challenges transcription and phosphorylation in magnitude and is one of the most important regulatory mechanisms in plants. This article describes the characterization of a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) auxin-responsive Kelch-domain-containing F-box protein, OsFBK1, found to be a component of an SCF E3 ligase by interaction studies in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>. Rice transgenics of <i>OsFBK1</i> displayed variations in anther and root secondary cell wall content; it could be corroborated by electron/confocal microscopy and lignification studies, with no apparent changes in auxin content/signaling pathway. The presence of U-shaped secondary wall thickenings (or lignin) in the anthers were remarkably less pronounced in plants overexpressing <i>OsFBK1</i> as compared to wild-type and knockdown transgenics. The roots of the transgenics also displayed differential accumulation of lignin. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> two-hybrid anther library screening identified an OsCCR that is a homolog of the well-studied Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) IRX4; OsFBK1-OsCCR interaction was confirmed by fluorescence and immunoprecipitation studies. Degradation of OsCCR mediated by SCF<sup>OsFBK1</sup> and the 26S proteasome pathway was validated by cell-free experiments in the absence of auxin, indicating that the phenotype observed is due to the direct interaction between OsFBK1 and OsCCR. Interestingly, the <i>OsCCR</i> knockdown transgenics also displayed a decrease in root and anther lignin depositions, suggesting that OsFBK1 plays a role in the development of rice anthers and roots by regulating the cellular levels of a key enzyme controlling lignification.</p>

Sugar Transporter STP7 Specificity for <sc>l</sc>-Arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-Xylose Contrasts with the Typical Hexose Transporters STP8 and STP12
<p>The controlled distribution of sugars between assimilate-exporting source tissues and sugar-consuming sink tissues is a key element for plant growth and development. Monosaccharide transporters of the SUGAR TRANSPORT PROTEIN (STP) family contribute to the uptake of sugars into sink cells. Here, we report on the characterization of STP7, STP8, and STP12, three previously uncharacterized members of this family in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Heterologous expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) revealed that STP8 and STP12 catalyze the high-affinity proton-dependent uptake of glucose and also accept galactose and mannose. STP12 additionally transports xylose. <i>STP8</i> and <i>STP12</i> are highly expressed in reproductive organs, where their protein products might contribute to sugar uptake into the pollen tube and the embryo sac. <i>stp8.1</i> and <i>stp12.1</i> T-DNA insertion lines developed normally, which may point toward functional redundancy with other STPs. In contrast to all other STPs, STP7 does not transport hexoses but is specific for the pentoses <sc>l</sc>-arabinose and <sc>d</sc>-xylose. <i>STP7-</i>promoter-reporter gene plants showed an expression of <i>STP7</i> especially in tissues with high cell wall turnover, indicating that STP7 might contribute to the uptake and recycling of cell wall sugars. Uptake analyses with radioactive <sc>l</sc>-arabinose revealed that 11 other STPs are able to transport <sc>l</sc>-arabinose with high affinity. Hence, functional redundancy might explain the missing-mutant phenotype of two <i>stp7</i> T-DNA insertion lines. Together, these data complete the characterization of the STP family and present the STPs as new <sc>l</sc>-arabinose transporters for potential biotechnological applications.</p>

Plant Temperature Acclimation and Growth Rely on Cytosolic Ribosome Biogenesis Factor Homologs
<p>Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) REI1-LIKE (REIL) proteins, REIL1 and REIL2, are homologs of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> ribosome biogenesis factor that participates in late cytoplasmic 60S ribosomal subunit maturation. Here, we report that the inhibited growth of the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant at 10°C can be rescued by the expression of amino-terminal FLUORESCENT PROTEIN (FP)-REIL fusions driven by the <i>UBIQUITIN10</i> promoter, allowing the analysis of REIL function in planta. Arabidopsis REIL1 appears to be functionally conserved, based on the cytosolic localization of FP-REIL1 and the interaction of native REIL1 with the 60S subunit in wild-type plants. In contrast to its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> homologs, REIL1 also was present in translating ribosome fractions. Systems analysis revealed that wild-type Arabidopsis remodels the cytosolic translation machinery when grown at 10°C by accumulating cytosolic ribosome subunits and inducing the expression of cytosolic ribosomal RNA, ribosomal genes, ribosome biogenesis factors, and translation initiation or elongation factors. In the <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> mutant, all processes associated with inhibited growth were delayed, although the plants maintained cellular integrity or acquired freezing tolerance. REIL proteins also were implicated in plant-specific processes: nonacclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> exhibited cold-acclimation responses, including activation of the DREB/CBF regulon. In addition, acclimated <i>reil1-1 reil2-1</i> plants failed to activate <i>FLOWERING LOCUS T</i> expression in mature leaves. Therefore, in the wild type, REIL function may contribute to temperature perception by suppressing premature cold responses during growth at nonstressful temperatures. In conclusion, we suggest that Arabidopsis REIL proteins influence cold-induced plant ribosome remodeling and enhance the accumulation of cytosolic ribosome subunits after cold shift either by de novo synthesis or by recycling them from the translating ribosome fraction.</p>

Wheat Vacuolar Iron Transporter TaVIT2 Transports Fe and Mn and Is Effective for Biofortification
<p>Increasing the intrinsic nutritional quality of crops, known as biofortification, is viewed as a sustainable approach to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies. In particular, iron deficiency anemia is a major global health issue, but the iron content of staple crops such as wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) is difficult to change because of genetic complexity and homeostasis mechanisms. To identify target genes for the biofortification of wheat, we functionally characterized homologs of the <i>VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER</i> (<i>VIT</i>). The wheat genome contains two <i>VIT</i> paralogs, <i>TaVIT1</i> and <i>TaVIT2</i>, which have different expression patterns but are both low in the endosperm. TaVIT2, but not TaVIT1, was able to rescue the growth of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) mutant defective in vacuolar iron transport. TaVIT2 also complemented a manganese transporter mutant but not a vacuolar zinc transporter mutant. By overexpressing <i>TaVIT2</i> under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, we achieved a greater than 2-fold increase in iron in white flour fractions, exceeding minimum legal fortification levels in countries such as the United Kingdom. The antinutrient phytate was not increased and the iron in the white flour fraction was bioavailable in vitro, suggesting that food products made from the biofortified flour could contribute to improved iron nutrition. The single-gene approach impacted minimally on plant growth and also was effective in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). Our results show that by enhancing vacuolar iron transport in the endosperm, this essential micronutrient accumulated in this tissue, bypassing existing homeostatic mechanisms.</p>

Analysis of the ZAR1 Immune Complex Reveals Determinants for Immunity and Molecular Interactions<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plants depend on innate immunity to prevent disease. Plant pathogenic bacteria, like <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and <i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>, use the type III secretion system as a molecular syringe to inject type III secreted effector (T3SE) proteins in plants. The primary function of most T3SEs is to suppress immunity; however, the plant can evolve nucleotide-binding domain-leucine-rich repeat domain-containing proteins to recognize specific T3SEs. The AtZAR1 NLR induces strong defense responses against <i>P. syringae</i> and <i>X. campestris</i>. The <i>P. syringae</i> T3SE HopZ1a is an acetyltransferase that acetylates the pseudokinase AtZED1 and triggers recognition by AtZAR1. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that lead to AtZAR1-induced immunity in response to HopZ1a. We established a transient expression system in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> to study detailed interactions among HopZ1a, AtZED1, and AtZAR1. We show that the AtZAR1 immune pathway is conserved in <i>N. benthamiana</i> and identify AtZAR1 domains, and residues in AtZAR1 and AtZED1, that are important for immunity and protein-protein interactions in planta and in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>). We show that the coiled-coil domain of AtZAR1 oligomerizes, and this domain acts as a signal to induce immunity. This detailed analysis of the AtZAR1-AtZED1 protein complex provides a better understanding of the immune signaling hub controlled by AtZAR1.</p>

Suppressor of Overexpression of CO 1 Negatively Regulates Dark-Induced Leaf Degreening and Senescence by Directly Repressing Pheophytinase and Other Senescence-Associated Genes in Arabidopsis
<p>Although the biochemical pathway of chlorophyll (Chl) degradation has been largely elucidated, how Chl is rapidly yet coordinately degraded during leaf senescence remains elusive. Pheophytinase (PPH) is the enzyme for catalyzing the removal of the phytol group from pheophytin <i>a</i>, and <i>PPH</i> expression is significantly induced during leaf senescence. To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of <i>PPH</i>, we used a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) one-hybrid system to screen for its trans-regulators. SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 (SOC1), a key flowering pathway integrator, was initially identified as one of the putative trans-regulators of <i>PPH</i>. After dark treatment, leaves of an <i>SOC1</i> knockdown mutant (<i>soc1-6</i>) showed an accelerated yellowing phenotype, whereas those of <i>SOC1</i>-overexpressing lines exhibited a partial stay-green phenotype. <i>SOC1</i> and <i>PPH</i> expression showed a negative correlation during leaf senescence. Substantially, SOC1 protein could bind specifically to the CArG box of the <i>PPH</i> promoter in vitro and in vivo, and overexpression of <i>SOC1</i> significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the <i>PPH</i> promoter in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) protoplasts. Importantly, <i>soc1-6 pph-1</i> (a <i>PPH</i> knockout mutant) double mutant displayed a stay-green phenotype similar to that of <i>pph-1</i> during dark treatment. These results demonstrated that SOC1 inhibits Chl degradation via negatively regulating <i>PPH</i> expression. In addition, measurement of the Chl content and the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II of <i>soc1-6</i> and <i>SOC1-OE</i> leaves after dark treatment suggested that SOC1 also negatively regulates the general senescence process. Seven <i>SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED GENES</i> (<i>SAGs</i>) were thereafter identified as its potential target genes, and <i>NONYELLOWING1</i> and <i>SAG113</i> were experimentally confirmed. Together, we reveal that SOC1 represses dark-induced leaf Chl degradation and senescence in general in Arabidopsis.</p>

Sucrose Transporter Localization and Function in Phloem Unloading in Developing Stems
<p>How sucrose transporters (SUTs) regulate phloem unloading in monocot stems is poorly understood and particularly so for species storing high Suc concentrations. To this end, <i>Sorghum bicolor</i> SUTs SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 were characterized by determining their transport properties heterologously expressed in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> or <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, and their in planta cellular and subcellular localization. The plasma membrane-localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 exhibited a strong selectivity for Suc and high Suc affinities in <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes at pH 5—SbSUT1, 6.3 ± 0.7 m<sc>m,</sc> and SbSUT5, 2.4 ± 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> Suc. The Suc affinity of SbSUT1 was dependent on membrane potential and pH. In contrast, SbSUT5 Suc affinity was independent of membrane potential and pH but supported high transport rates at neutral pH. Suc transport by the tonoplast localized SbSUT4 could not be detected using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> or <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. Across internode development, SUTs, other than SbSUT4, were immunolocalized to sieve elements, while for elongating and recently elongated internodes, SUTs also were detected in storage parenchyma cells. We conclude that apoplasmic Suc unloading from de-energized protophloem sieve elements in meristematic zones may be mediated by reversal of SbSUT1 and/or by uniporting SWEETs. Storage parenchyma localized SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 may accumulate Suc from the stem apoplasms of elongating and recently elongated internodes, whereas SbSUT4 may function to release Suc from vacuoles. Transiting from an apoplasmic to symplasmic unloading pathway as the stem matures, SbSUT1 and SbSUT5 increasingly function in Suc retrieval into metaphloem sieve elements to maintain a high turgor to drive symplasmic unloading by bulk flow.</p>

Resolvase OsGEN1 Mediates DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Yen1/GEN1 are canonical Holliday junction resolvases that belong to the RAD2/XPG family. In eukaryotes, such as budding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>, mice, worms, and humans, Yen1/GEN1 work together with Mus81-Mms4/MUS81-EME1 and Slx1-Slx4/SLX1-SLX4 in DNA repair by homologous recombination to maintain genome stability. In plants, the biological function of Yen1/GEN1 remains largely unclear. In this study, we characterized the loss of function mutants of <i>OsGEN1</i> and <i>OsSEND1</i>, a pair of paralogs of Yen1/GEN1 in rice (<i>Oryza</i> <i>sativa</i>). We first investigated the role of <i>OsGEN1</i> during meiosis and found a reduction in chiasma frequency by ∼6% in <i>osgen1</i> mutants, compared to the wild type, suggesting a possible involvement of OsGEN1 in the formation of crossovers. Postmeiosis, OsGEN1 foci were detected in wild-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>e nuclei, but not in the <i>osgen1</i> mutant concomitant with an increase in double-strand breaks. Persistent double-strand breaks led to programmed cell death of the male gametes and complete male sterility. In contrast, depletion of <i>OsSEND1</i> had no effects on plant development and did not enhance <i>osgen1</i> defects. Our results indicate that OsGEN1 is essential for homologous recombinational DNA repair at two stages of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>ogenesis in rice.</p>

A Palmitic Acid Elongase Affects Eicosapentaenoic Acid and Plastidial Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol Levels in Nannochloropsis
<p><i>Nannochloropsis</i> species are oleaginous eukaryotes containing a plastid limited by four membranes, deriving from a secondary endosymbiosis. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, thylakoid lipids, including monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. Fatty acids are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The production of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown process. We identified seven elongases and five desaturases possibly involved in EPA production in <i>Nannochloropsis gaditana</i>. Among the six heterokont-specific saturated FA elongases possibly acting upstream in this pathway, we characterized the highly expressed isoform <i>Δ0-ELO1</i>. Heterologous expression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) showed that NgΔ0-ELO1 could elongate palmitic acid. <i>Nannochloropsis</i> Δ0-elo1 mutants exhibited a reduced EPA level and a specific decrease in MGDG. In NgΔ0-elo1 lines, the impairment of photosynthesis is consistent with a role of EPA-rich MGDG in nonphotochemical quenching control, possibly providing an appropriate MGDG platform for the xanthophyll cycle. Concomitantly with MGDG decrease, the level of triacylglycerol (TAG) containing medium chain FAs increased. In <i>Nannochloropsis</i>, part of EPA used for MGDG production is therefore biosynthesized by a channeled process initiated at the elongation step of palmitic acid by Δ0-ELO1, thus acting as a committing enzyme for galactolipid production. Based on the MGDG/TAG balance controlled by Δ0-ELO1, this study also provides novel prospects for the engineering of oleaginous microalgae for biotechnological applications.</p>

KNS4/UPEX1: A Type II Arabinogalactan <i>β</i>-(1,3)-Galactosyltransferase Required for Pollen Exine Development
<p>Pollen exine is essential for protection from the environment of the male gametes of seed-producing plants, but its assembly and composition remain poorly understood. We previously characterized Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis</i> <i>thaliana</i>) mutants with abnormal pollen exine structure and morphology that we named <i>kaonashi</i> (<i>kns</i>). Here we describe the identification of the causal gene of <i>kns4</i> that was found to be a member of the CAZy glycosyltransferase 31 gene family, identical to <i>UNEVEN PATTERN OF EXINE1</i>, and the biochemical characterization of the encoded protein. The characteristic exine phenotype in the <i>kns4</i> mutant is related to an abnormality of the primexine matrix laid on the surface of developing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es. Using light microscopy with a combination of type II arabinogalactan (AG) antibodies and staining with the arabinogalactan-protein (AGP)-specific β-Glc Yariv reagent, we show that the levels of AGPs in the <i>kns4</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>e primexine are considerably diminished, and their location differs from that of wild type, as does the distribution of pectin labeling. Furthermore, <i>kns4</i> mutants exhibit reduced fertility as indicated by shorter fruit lengths and lower seed set compared to the wild type, confirming that KNS4 is critical for pollen viability and development. KNS4 was heterologously expressed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, and was shown to possess β-(1,3)-galactosyltransferase activity responsible for the synthesis of AG glycans that are present on both AGPs and/or the pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan I. These data demonstrate that defects in AGP/pectic glycans, caused by disruption of <i>KNS4</i> function, impact pollen development and viability in Arabidopsis.</p>

A Universal Stress Protein Involved in Oxidative Stress Is a Phosphorylation Target for Protein Kinase CIPK6
<p>Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) decode calcium signals upon interaction with the calcium sensors calcineurin B like proteins into phosphorylation events that result into adaptation to environmental stresses. Few phosphorylation targets of CIPKs are known and therefore the molecular mechanisms underlying their downstream output responses are not fully understood. Tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) Cipk6 regulates immune and susceptible Programmed cell death in immunity transforming Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals into reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. To investigate SlCipk6-induced molecular mechanisms and identify putative substrates, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> two-hybrid approach was carried on and a protein was identified that contained a Universal stress protein (Usp) domain present in bacteria, protozoa and plants, which we named “SlRd2”. SlRd2 was an ATP-binding protein that formed homodimers in planta. SlCipk6 and SlRd2 interacted using coimmunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves and the complex localized in the cytosol. SlCipk6 phosphorylated SlRd2 in vitro, thus defining, to our knowledge, a novel target for CIPKs. Heterologous SlRd2 overexpression in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> conferred resistance to highly toxic LiCl, whereas SlRd2 expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> <i>UspA</i> mutant restored bacterial viability in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Finally, transient expression of SlCipk6 in transgenic <i>N</i>. <i>benthamiana</i> SlRd2 overexpressors resulted in reduced ROS accumulation as compared to wild-type plants. Taken together, our results establish that SlRd2, a tomato UspA, is, to our knowledge, a novel interactor and phosphorylation target of a member of the CIPK family, SlCipk6, and functionally regulates SlCipk6-mediated ROS generation.</p>

Substituted Phthalimide AC94377 Is a Selective Agonist of the Gibberellin Receptor GID1
<p>Gibberellin (GA) is a major plant hormone that regulates plant growth and development and is widely used as a plant growth regulator in agricultural production. There is an increasing demand for function-limited GA mimics due to the limitations on the agronomical application of GA to crops, including GA’s high cost of producing and its leading to the crops’ lodging. AC94377, a substituted phthalimide, is a chemical that mimics the growth-regulating activity of GAs in various plants, despite its structural difference. Although AC94377 is widely studied in many weeds and crops, its mode of action as a GA mimic is largely unknown. In this study, we confirmed that AC94377 displays GA-like activities in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and demonstrated that AC94377 binds to the Arabidopsis GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) receptor (AtGID1), forms the AtGID1-AC94377-DELLA complex, and induces the degradation of DELLA protein. Our results also indicated that AC94377 is selective for a specific subtype among three AtGID1s and that the selectivity of AC94377 is attributable to a single residue at the entrance to the hydrophobic pocket of GID1. We conclude that AC94377 is a GID1 agonist with selectivity for a specific subtype of GID1, which could be further developed and used as a function-limited regulator of plant growth in both basic study and agriculture.</p>

A Rice Ca<sup>2+</sup> Binding Protein Is Required for Tapetum Function and Pollen Formation
<p>In flowering plants, successful male reproduction requires the sophisticated interaction between somatic anther wall layers and reproductive cells. Timely degradation of the innermost tissue of the anther wall layer, the tapetal layer, is critical for pollen development. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a well-known stimulus for plant development, but whether it plays a role in affecting male reproduction remains elusive. Here we report a role of Defective in Exine Formation 1 (OsDEX1) in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>), a Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, in regulating rice tapetal cell degradation and pollen formation. In <i>osdex1</i> anthers, tapetal cell degeneration is delayed and degradation of the callose wall surrounding the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es is compromised, leading to aborted pollen formation and complete male sterility. <i>OsDEX1</i> is expressed in tapetal cells and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">microspor</span></strong>es during early anther development. Recombinant OsDEX1 is able to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in vitro, and <i>osdex1</i> exhibited disturbed Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in tapetal cells. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that OsDEX1 may have a conserved function in binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> in flowering plants, and genetic complementation of pollen wall defects of an Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>dex1</i> mutant confirmed its evolutionary conservation in pollen development. Collectively, these findings suggest that OsDEX1 plays a fundamental role in the development of tapetal cells and pollen formation, possibly via modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis during pollen development.</p>

Fitness Trade-Offs Lead to Suppressor Tolerance in Yeast
<p>Genetic variation among individuals within a population provides the raw material for phenotypic diversity upon which natural selection operates. Some given variants can act on multiple standing genomic variations simultaneously and release previously inaccessible phenotypes, leading to increased adaptive potential upon challenging environments. Previously, we identified such a variant related to a tRNA nonsense suppressor in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>. When introduced into other genetic backgrounds, the suppressor led to an increased population phenotypic variance on various culture conditions, conferring background and environment specific selective advantages. Nonetheless, most isolates are intolerant to the suppressor on rich media due to a severe fitness cost. Here, we found that the tolerance to suppressor is related to a surprising level of fitness outburst, showing a trade-off effect to accommodate the cost of carrying the suppressor. To dissect the genetic basis of such trade-offs, we crossed strains with contrasting tolerance levels on rich media, and analyzed the fitness distribution patterns in the offspring. Combining quantitative tetrad analysis and bulk segregant analysis, we identified two genes, namely <i>MKT1</i> and <i>RGA1</i>, involved in suppressor tolerance. We showed that alleles from the tolerant parent for both genes conferred a significant gain of fitness, which increased the suppressor tolerance. Our results present a detailed dissection of suppressor tolerance in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> and provide insights into the molecular basis of trade-offs between fitness and evolutionary potential.</p>

The Genotype–Phenotype Map of Yeast Complex Traits: Basic Parameters and the Role of Natural Selection
<p>Most phenotypic traits are controlled by many genes, but a global picture of the genotype–phenotype map (GPM) is lacking. For example, in no species do we know generally how many genes affect a trait and how large these effects are. It is also unclear to what extent GPMs are shaped by natural selection. Here we address these fundamental questions using the reverse genetic data of 220 morphological traits in 4,718 budding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> strains, each of which lacks a nonessential gene. We show that 1) the proportion of genes affecting a trait varies from <1% to >30%, averaging 6%, 2) most traits are impacted by many more small-effect genes than large-effect genes, and 3) the mean effect of all nonessential genes on a trait decreases precipitously as the estimated importance of the trait to fitness increases. An analysis of 3,116 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> gene expression traits in 754 gene-deletion strains reveals a similar pattern. These findings illustrate the power of genome-wide reverse genetics in genotype–phenotype mapping, uncover an enormous range of genetic complexity of phenotypic traits, and suggest that the GPM of cellular organisms has been shaped by natural selection for mutational robustness.</p>

The Repertoires of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes in Eukaryotic Genomes
<p>Reversible protein ubiquitination regulates virtually all known cellular activities. Here, we present a quantitatively evaluated and broadly applicable method to predict eukaryotic ubiquitinating enzymes (UBE) and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) and its application to 50 distinct genomes belonging to four of the five major phylogenetic supergroups of eukaryotes: unikonts (including metazoans, fungi, choanozoa, and amoebozoa), excavates, chromalveolates, and plants. Our method relies on a collection of profile hidden Markov models, and we demonstrate its superior performance (coverage and classification accuracy >99%) by identifying approximately 25% and approximately 35% additional UBE and DUB genes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong> and human, which had not been reported before. In <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">yeast</span></strong>, we predict 85 UBE and 24 DUB genes, for 814 UBE and 107 DUB genes in the human genome. Most UBE and DUB families are present in all eukaryotic lineages, with plants and animals harboring massively enlarged repertoires of ubiquitin ligases. Unicellular organisms, on the other hand, typically harbor less than 300 UBEs and less than 40 DUBs per genome. Ninety-one UBE/DUB genes are orthologous across all four eukaryotic supergroups, and these likely represent a primordial core of enzymes of the ubiquitination system probably dating back to the first eukaryotes approximately 2 billion years ago. Our genome-wide predictions are available through the Database of Ubiquitinating and Deubiquitinating Enzymes (<ext-link>www.DUDE-db.org</ext-link>), where users can also perform advanced sequence and phylogenetic analyses and submit their own predictions.</p>

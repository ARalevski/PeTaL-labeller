Electrical suppression of all nonradiative recombination pathways in monolayer semiconductors
<p>Defects in conventional semiconductors substantially lower the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoluminesc</span></strong>ence (PL) quantum yield (QY), a key metric of optoelectronic performance that directly dictates the maximum device efficiency. Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>, often exhibit low PL QY for as-processed samples, which has typically been attributed to a large native defect density. We show that the PL QY of as-processed MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub> monolayers reaches near-unity when they are made intrinsic through electrostatic doping, without any chemical passivation. Surprisingly, neutral exciton recombination is entirely radiative even in the presence of a high native defect density. This finding enables TMDC monolayers for optoelectronic device applications as the stringent requirement of low defect density is eased.</p>

Eliminating nonradiative decay in Cu(I) emitters: >99% quantum efficiency and microsecond lifetime
<p>Luminescent complexes of heavy metals such as iridium, platinum, and ruthenium play an important role in photocatalysis and energy conversion applications as well as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Achieving comparable performance from more–earth-abundant copper requires overcoming the weak spin-orbit coupling of the light metal as well as limiting the high reorganization energies typical in copper(I) [Cu(I)] complexes. Here we report that two-coordinate Cu(I) complexes with redox active ligands in coplanar conformation manifest suppressed nonradiative decay, reduced structural reorganization, and sufficient orbital overlap for efficient charge transfer. We achieve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoluminesc</span></strong>ence efficiencies >99% and microsecond lifetimes, which lead to an efficient blue-emitting OLED. Photophysical analysis and simulations reveal a temperature-dependent interplay between emissive singlet and triplet charge-transfer states and amide-localized triplet states.</p>

Controlled crack propagation for atomic precision handling of wafer-scale two-dimensional materials
<p>Although flakes of two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures at the micrometer scale can be formed with adhesive-tape exfoliation methods, isolation of 2D flakes into monolayers is extremely time consuming because it is a trial-and-error process. Controlling the number of 2D layers through direct growth also presents difficulty because of the high nucleation barrier on 2D materials. We demonstrate a layer-resolved 2D material splitting technique that permits high-throughput production of multiple monolayers of wafer-scale (5-centimeter diameter) 2D materials by splitting single stacks of thick 2D materials grown on a single wafer. Wafer-scale uniformity of hexagonal boron nitride, tungsten disulfide, tungsten diselenide, molybdenum disulfide, and molybdenum diselenide monolayers was verified by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoluminesc</span></strong>ence response and by substantial retention of electronic conductivity. We fabricated wafer-scale van der Waals heterostructures, including field-effect transistors, with single-atom thickness resolution.</p>

Coherent, atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenide superlattices with engineered strain
<p>Epitaxy forms the basis of modern electronics and optoelectronics. We report coherent atomically thin superlattices in which different transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers—despite large lattice mismatches—are repeated and laterally integrated without dislocations within the monolayer plane. Grown by an omnidirectional epitaxy, these superlattices display fully matched lattice constants across heterointerfaces while maintaining an isotropic lattice structure and triangular symmetry. This strong epitaxial strain is precisely engineered via the nanoscale supercell dimensions, thereby enabling broad tuning of the optical properties and producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoluminesc</span></strong>ence peak shifts as large as 250 millielectron volts. We present theoretical models to explain this coherent growth and the energetic interplay governing the ripple formation in these strained monolayers. Such coherent superlattices provide building blocks with targeted functionalities at the atomically thin limit.</p>

Robust epitaxial growth of two-dimensional heterostructures, multiheterostructures, and superlattices
<p>We report a general synthetic strategy for highly robust growth of diverse lateral heterostructures, multiheterostructures, and superlattices from two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals. A reverse flow during the temperature-swing stage in the sequential vapor deposition growth process allowed us to cool the existing 2D crystals to prevent undesired thermal degradation and uncontrolled homogeneous nucleation, thus enabling highly robust block-by-block epitaxial growth. Raman and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">photoluminesc</span></strong>ence mapping studies showed that a wide range of 2D heterostructures (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>-MoSe<sub>2</sub>), multiheterostructures (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-MoS<sub>2</sub> and WS<sub>2</sub>-MoSe<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>), and superlattices (such as WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub>) were readily prepared with precisely controlled spatial modulation. Transmission electron microscope studies showed clear chemical modulation with atomically sharp interfaces. Electrical transport studies of WSe<sub>2</sub>-WS<sub>2</sub> lateral junctions showed well-defined diode characteristics with a rectification ratio up to 10<sup>5</sup>.</p>

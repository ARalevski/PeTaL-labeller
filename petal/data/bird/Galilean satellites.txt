Impact craters on Pluto and Charon indicate a deficit of small Kuiper belt objects
<p>The flyby of Pluto and Charon by the New Horizons spacecraft provided high-resolut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n images of cratered surfaces embedded in the Kuiper belt, an extensive reg<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n of bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. Impact craters on Pluto and Charon were formed by collis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns with other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) with diameters from ~40 kilometers to ~300 meters, smaller than most KBOs observed directly by telescopes. We find a relative paucity of small craters ≲13 kilometers in diameter, which cannot be explained solely by geological resurfacing. This implies a deficit of small KBOs (≲1 to 2 kilometers in diameter). Some surfaces on Pluto and Charon are likely ≳4 bill<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n years old, thus their crater records provide informat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n on the size-frequency distribut<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n of KBOs in the early Solar System.</p>

Juno observations of spot structures and a split tail in Io-induced aurorae on Jupiter
<p>Jupiter’s aurorae are produced in its upper atmosphere when incoming high-energy electrons precipitate along the planet’s magnetic field lines. A northern and a southern main auroral oval are visible, surrounded by small emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n features associated with the Galilean moons. We present infrared observat<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>ns, obtained with the Juno spacecraft, showing that in the case of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>, this emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n exhibits a swirling pattern that is similar in appearance to a von Kéèèárméèèáán vortex street. Well downstream of the main auroral spots, the extended tail is split in two. Both of Ganymede’s footprints also appear as a pair of emiss<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n features, which may provide a remote measure of Ganymede’s magnetosphere. These features suggest that the magnetohydrodynamic interact<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>n between Jupiter and its moon is more complex than prev<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">io</span></strong>usly anticipated.</p>

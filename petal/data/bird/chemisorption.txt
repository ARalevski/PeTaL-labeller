A general synthesis approach for supported bimetallic nanoparticles via surface inorganometallic chemistry
<p>The synthesis of ultrasmall supported bimetallic nanoparticles (between 1 and 3 nanometers in diameter) with well-defined stoichiometry and intimacy between constituent metals remains a substantial challenge. We synthesized 10 different supported bimetallic nanoparticles via surface inorganometallic chemistry by decomposing and reducing surface-adsorbed heterometallic double complex salts, which are readily obtained upon sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adsorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion of target cations and anions on a silica substrate. For example, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adsorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion of tetraamminepalladium(II) [Pd(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub><sup>2+</sup>] followed by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adsorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion of tetrachloroplatinate [PtCl<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>] was used to form palladium-platinum (Pd-Pt) nanoparticles. These supported bimetallic nanoparticles show enhanced catalytic performance in acetylene selective hydrogenation, which clearly demonstrates a synergistic effect between constituent metals.</p>

Clinic Blood Pressure Underestimates Ambulatory Blood Pressure in an Untreated Employer-Based US Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) is consistently superior to clinic blood pressure (CBP) as a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk. A common perception is that ABP is usually lower than CBP. The relationship of the CBP minus ABP difference to age has not been examined in the United States.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Between 2005 and 2012, 888 healthy, employed, middle-aged (mean±SD age, 45±10.4 years) individuals (59% female, 7.4% black, 12% Hispanic) with screening BP <160/105 mm Hg and not taking antihypertensive medication completed 3 separate clinic BP assessments and a 24-hour ABP recording for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mask</span></strong>ed Hypertension Study. The distributions of CBP, mean awake ABP (aABP), and the CBP−aABP difference in the full sample and by demographic characteristics were compared. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing was used to model the relationship of the BP measures to age and body mass index. The prevalence of discrepancies in ABP- versus CBP-defined hypertension status—white-coat hypertension and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mask</span></strong>ed hypertension—were also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Average systolic/diastolic aABP (123.0/77.4±10.3/7.4 mm Hg) was significantly higher than the average of 9 CBP readings over 3 visits (116.0/75.4±11.6/7.7 mm Hg). aABP exceeded CBP by >10 mm Hg much more frequently than CBP exceeded aABP. The difference (aABP>CBP) was most pronounced in young adults and those with normal body mass index. The systolic difference progressively diminished, but did not disappear, at older ages and higher body mass indexes. The diastolic difference vanished around age 65 and reversed (CBP>aABP) for body mass index >32.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Whereas 5.3% of participants were hypertensive by CBP, 19.2% were hypertensive by aABP; 15.7% of those with nonelevated CBP had <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mask</span></strong>ed hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Contrary to a widely held belief, based primarily on cohort studies of patients with elevated CBP, ABP is not usually lower than CBP, at least not among healthy, employed individuals. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of otherwise healthy individuals with nonelevated CBP have <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mask</span></strong>ed hypertension. Demonstrated CBP−aABP gradients, if confirmed in representative samples (eg, NHANES [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey]), could provide guidance for primary care physicians as to when, for a given CBP, 24-hour ABP would be useful to identify or rule out <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mask</span></strong>ed hypertension.</p></sec>

Atomically dispersed Fe<sup>3+</sup> sites catalyze efficient CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction to CO
<p>Currently, the most active electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO are gold-based nanomaterials, whereas non–precious metal catalysts have shown low to modest activity. Here, we report a catalyst of dispersed single-atom iron sites that produces CO at an overpotential as low as 80 millivolts. Partial current density reaches 94 milliamperes per square centimeter at an overpotential of 340 millivolts. Operando x-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed the active sites to be discrete Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions, coordinated to pyrrolic nitrogen (N) atoms of the N-doped carbon support, that maintain their +3 oxidation state during electrocatalysis, probably through electronic coupling to the conductive carbon support. Electrochemical data suggest that the Fe<sup>3+</sup> sites derive their superior activity from faster CO<sub>2</sub> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adsorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion and weaker CO absorption than that of conventional Fe<sup>2+</sup> sites.</p>

Design and control of gas diffusion process in a nanoporous soft crystal
<p>Design of the gas-diffusion process in a porous material is challenging because a contracted pore aperture is a prerequisite, whereas the channel traffic of guest molecules is regulated by the flexible and dynamic motions of nanochannels. Here, we present the rational design of a diffusion-regulatory system in a porous coordination polymer (PCP) in which flip-flop molecular motions within the framework structure provide kinetic gate functions that enable efficient gas separation and storage. The PCP shows substantial temperature-responsive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adsorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion in which the adsorbate molecules are differentiated by each gate-admission temperature, facilitating kinetics-based gas separations of oxygen/argon and ethylene/ethane with high selectivities of ~350 and ~75, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the long-lasting physical encapsulation of ethylene at ambient conditions, owing to strongly impeded diffusion in distinctive nanochannels.</p>

Ethane/ethylene separation in a metal-organic framework with iron-peroxo sites
<p>The separation of ethane from its corresponding ethylene is an important, challenging, and energy-intensive process in the chemical industry. Here we report a microporous metal-organic framework, iron(III) peroxide 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate [Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) (dobdc<sup>4−</sup>: 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)], with iron (Fe)–peroxo sites for the preferential binding of ethane over ethylene and thus highly selective separation of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Neutron powder diffraction studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate the key role of Fe-peroxo sites for the recognition of ethane. The high performance of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for the ethane/ethylene separation has been validated by gas sorption isotherms, ideal adsorbed solution theory calculations, and simulated and experimental breakthrough curves. Through a fixed-bed column packed with this porous material, polymer-grade ethylene (99.99% pure) can be straightforwardly produced from ethane/ethylene mixtures during the first <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adsorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion cycle, demonstrating the potential of Fe<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>)(dobdc) for this important industrial separation with a low energy cost under ambient conditions.</p>

Destabilizing mutations encode nongenetic variation that drives evolutionary innovation
<p>Evolutionary innovations are often achieved by repurposing existing genes to perform new functions; however, the mechanisms enabling the transition from old to new remain controversial. We identified mutations in bacteriophage λ’s host-recognition gene <i>J</i> that confer enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adsorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion to λ’s native receptor, LamB, and the ability to access a new receptor, OmpF. The mutations destabilize λ particles and cause conformational bistability of J, which yields progeny of multiple phenotypic forms, each proficient at different receptors. This work provides an example of how nongenetic protein variation can catalyze an evolutionary innovation. We propose that cases where a single genotype can manifest as multiple phenotypes may be more common than previously expected and offer a general mechanism for evolutionary innovation.</p>

We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, the catalytic role played by single metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adatom</span></strong>s during the technologically relevant process of graphene growth on nickel (Ni). The catalytic action of individual Ni atoms at the edges of a growing graphene flake was directly captured by scanning tunneling microscopy imaging at the millisecond time scale, while force field molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations rationalize the experimental observations. Our results unveil the mechanism governing the activity of a single-atom catalyst at work.</p>

Control of zeolite framework flexibility and pore topology for separation of ethane and ethylene
<p>The discovery of new materials for separating ethylene from ethane by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adsorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion, instead of using cryogenic distillation, is a key milestone for molecular separations because of the multiple and widely extended uses of these molecules in industry. This technique has the potential to provide tremendous energy savings when compared with the currently used cryogenic distillation process for ethylene produced through steam cracking. Here we describe the synthesis and structural determination of a flexible pure silica zeolite (ITQ-55). This material can kinetically separate ethylene from ethane with an unprecedented selectivity of ~100, owing to its distinctive pore topology with large heart-shaped cages and framework flexibility. Control of such properties extends the boundaries for applicability of zeolites to challenging separations.</p>

Controlling guest conformation for efficient purification of butadiene
<p>Conventional adsorbents preferentially adsorb the small, high-polarity, and unsaturated 1,3-butadiene molecule over the other C<sub>4</sub> hydrocarbons from which it must be separated. We show from single-crystal x-ray diffraction and computational simulation that a hydrophilic metal-organic framework, [Zn<sub>2</sub>(btm)<sub>2</sub>], where H<sub>2</sub>btm is bis(5-methyl-1<i>H</i>-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)methane, has quasi-discrete pores that can induce conformational changes in the flexible guest molecules, weakening 1,3-butadiene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adsorpt</span></strong></span></strong>ion through a large bending energy penalty. In a breakthrough operation at ambient temperature and pressure, this guest conformation–controlling adsorbent eluted 1,3-butadiene first, then butane, butene, and isobutene. Thus, 1,3-butadiene can be efficiently purified (≥99.5%) while avoiding high-temperature conditions that can lead to its undesirable polymerization.</p>

Wafer-scale single-crystal hexagonal boron nitride film via self-collimated grain formation
<p>Although polycrystalline hexagonal boron nitride (PC-hBN) has been realized, defects and grain boundaries still cause charge scatterings and trap sites, impeding high-performance electronics. Here, we report a method of synthesizing wafer-scale single-crystalline hBN (SC-hBN) monolayer films by chemical vapor deposition. The limited solubility of boron (B) and nitrogen (N) atoms in liquid gold promotes high diffusion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">adatom</span></strong>s on the surface of liquid at high temperature to provoke the circular hBN grains. These further evolve into closely packed unimodal grains by means of self-collimation of B and N edges inherited by electrostatic interaction between grains, eventually forming an SC-hBN film on a wafer scale. This SC-hBN film also allows for the synthesis of wafer-scale graphene/hBN heterostructure and single-crystalline tungsten disulfide.</p>

Fusion oncogenes—genetic musical chairs
<p>The cytogenetic definitions of many cancers predate the genome sequencing era. Indeed, some classes of cancers (largely subtypes of sarcomas, lymphomas, and leukemias) have long been defined by simple and distinct patterns of chromosomal changes, or karyotypes, that, in many cases, feature a single pathognomonic somatic translocation of two genomic regions that creates a fusion oncogene (for example, the Philadelphia chromosome translocation in chronic myelogenous leukemia results in the <i>BCR-ABL1</i> fusion oncogene) (<i>1</i>). Whereas many common cancers display genomic complexity consistent with multistep oncogenesis, such as carcinomas of breast and lung, cancers that are defined by translocations typically display simple karyotypes, suggesting that they were shaped by a single translocation. However, the cytogenetic simplicity of these cancers may <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mask</span></strong> more complex genomic events. On page 891 of this issue, Anderson <i>et al.</i> (<i>2</i>) report whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 50 Ewing sarcomas (EWSs), an aggressive sarcoma that is defined by fusion between the EWS RNA binding protein 1 (<i>EWSR1</i>) gene on chromosome 22 and an E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription factor gene, either <i>FLI1</i> at 11q24 or <i>ERG</i> at 21q11 (<i>3</i>). Anderson <i>et al.</i> show that ∼40% of <i>EWSR1-FLI1</i> fusions and all <i>EWSR1-ERG</i> fusions arise via a complex rearrangement pattern called chromoplexy, which was first identified in prostate cancer (<i>4</i>). They suggest that chromoplexy “bursts” may be early initiating events in Ewing sarcomagenesis and mark a more aggressive form of the disease.</p>

Scale-invariant magnetoresistance in a cuprate superconductor

Large gem diamonds from metallic liquid in Earth’s deep mantle

Here we report that large, exceptional gem diamonds like the Cullinan, Constellation, and Koh-i-Noor carry direct evidence of crystallization from a redox-sensitive metallic liquid phase in the deep mantle. These sublithospheric diamonds contain inclusions of solidified iron-nickel-carbon-sulfur melt, accompanied by a thin fluid layer of methane ± hydrogen, and sometimes majoritic garnet or former calcium silicate perovskite. The metal-dominated mineral assemblages and reduced volatiles in large gem diamonds indicate formation under metal-saturated conditions. We verify previous predictions that Earth has highly reducing deep mantle regions capable of precipitating a metallic iron phase that contains dissolved carbon and hydrogen.</p>

Spectroscopic snapshots of the proton-transfer mechanism in water

<i>PINOID</i> Is Required for Formation of the Stigma and Style in Rice
<p>The stigma is the entry point for sexual reproduction in plants, but the mechanisms underlying stigma development are largely unknown. Here, we disrupted putative auxin biosynthetic and signaling genes to evaluate their roles in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) development. Disruption of the rice <i>PINOID</i> (<i>OsPID</i>) gene completely eliminated the development of stigmas, and overexpression of <i>OsPID</i> led to overproliferation of stigmas, suggesting that <i>OsPID</i> is a key determinant for stigma development. Interestingly, <i>ospid</i> mutants did not display defects in flower initiation, nor did they develop any pin-like inflorescences, a characteristic phenotype observed in <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) and maize (<i>Zea mays</i>). We constructed double mutants of <i>OsPID</i> and its closest homolog, <i>OsPIDb</i>, yet the double mutants still did not develop any pin-like inflorescences, indicating that either <i>ospid</i> is compensated by additional homologous genes or <i>OsPID</i> has different functions in rice compared with <i>PID</i> in other organisms. We then knocked out one of the <i>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS</i> (<i>NPY</i>) genes, which cause the formation of pin-like inflorescences in Arabidopsis when compromised, in the <i>ospid</i> background. The <i>ospid osnpy2</i> double mutants developed pin-like inflorescences, which were phenotypically similar to <i>pid</i> mutants in Arabidopsis and maize, demonstrating that the roles of <i>OsPID</i> in inflorescence development are likely <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mask</span></strong>ed by redundant partners. This work identified a key determinant for stigma development in rice and revealed a complex picture of the <i>PID</i> gene in rice development. Furthermore, the stigma-less <i>ospid</i> mutants are potentially useful in producing hybrid rice.</p>

Genetics of Variable Disease Expression Conferred by Inverse Gene-For-Gene Interactions in the Wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> Pathosystem
<p>The wheat-<i>Parastagonospora nodorum</i> pathosystem involves the recognition of pathogen-secreted necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding wheat NE sensitivity genes. This inverse gene-for-gene recognition leads to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility and ultimately septoria nodorum blotch disease. Here, we used multiple pathogen isolates to individually evaluate the effects of the host gene-NE interactions <i>Tan spot necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum ToxinA (<i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA), <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin1 (<i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1), and <i>Stagonospora nodorum necrosis3-B genome homeolog1</i>-Stagonospora nodorum Toxin3 (<i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3), alone and in various combinations, to determine the relative importance of these interactions in causing disease. Genetic analysis of a recombinant inbred wheat population inoculated separately with three <i>P. nodorum</i> isolates, all of which produce all three NEs, indicated that the <i>Tsn1</i>-SnToxA and <i>Snn3-B1</i>-SnTox3 interactions contributed to disease caused by all four isolates, but their effects varied and ranged from epistatic to additive. The <i>Snn1</i>-SnTox1 interaction was associated with increased disease for one isolate, but for other isolates, there was evidence that this interaction inhibited the expression of other host gene-NE interactions. RNA sequencing analysis in planta showed that <i>SnTox1</i> was differentially expressed between these three isolates after infection. Further analysis of NE gene-knockout isolates showed that the effect of some interactions could be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mask</span></strong>ed or inhibited by other compatible interactions, and the regulation of this occurs at the level of NE gene transcription. Collectively, these results show that the inverse gene-for-gene interactions leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility in the wheat-<i>P. nodorum</i> pathosystem vary in their effects depending on the genetic backgrounds of the pathogen and host, and interplay among the interactions is complex and intricately regulated.</p>

The Distinct Roles of Class I and II RPD3-Like Histone Deacetylases in Salinity Stress Response
<p>Histone acetylation is an essential process in the epigenetic regulation of diverse biological processes, including environmental stress responses in plants. Previously, our research group identified a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (HDI) that confers salt tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). In this study, we demonstrate that class I HDAC (HDA19) and class II HDACs (HDA5/14/15/18) control responses to salt stress through different pathways. The screening of 12 different selective HDIs indicated that seven newly reported HDIs enhance salt tolerance. Genetic analysis, based on a pharmacological study, identified which HDACs function in salinity stress tolerance. In the wild-type Columbia-0 background, <i>hda19</i> plants exhibit tolerance to high-salinity stress, while <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants exhibit hypersensitivity to salt stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the effect of <i>HDA19</i> deficiency on the response to salinity stress is distinct from that of <i>HDA5/14/15/18</i> deficiencies. In <i>hda19</i> plants, the expression levels of stress tolerance-related genes, late embryogenesis abundant proteins that prevent protein aggregation and positive regulators such as ABI5 and NAC019 in abscisic acid signaling, were induced strongly relative to the wild type. Neither of these elements was up-regulated in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants. The mutagenesis of HDA19 by genome editing in the <i>hda5/14/15/18</i> plants enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting that suppression of HDA19 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mask</span></strong>s the phenotype caused by the suppression of class II HDACs in the salinity stress response. Collectively, our results demonstrate that HDIs that inhibit class I HDACs allow the rescue of plants from salinity stress regardless of their selectivity, and they provide insight into the hierarchal regulation of environmental stress responses through HDAC isoforms.</p>

Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and metabolism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the rotation of the planet. Photosynthesis is a key metabolic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of photosynthesis, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from photosynthesis also feeds back to regulate the circadian oscillator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian oscillator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by stabilizing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian oscillator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the stability of circadian oscillator proteins and can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mask</span></strong> the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce oscillations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mask</span></strong> the effects of oscillatory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, oscillations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The oscillations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all oscillations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the oscillations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Cyclooxygenase-2 in Endothelial and Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells Restrains Atherogenesis in Hyperlipidemic Mice
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>Placebo-controlled trials of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs selective for inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) reveal an emergent cardiovascular hazard in patients selected for low risk of heart disease. Postnatal global deletion of COX-2 accelerates atherogenesis in hyperlipidemic mice, a process delayed by selective enzyme deletion in macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>In the present study, selective depletion of COX-2 in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells depressed biosynthesis of prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub> and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>, elevated blood pressure, and accelerated atherogenesis in Ldlr knockout mice. Deletion of COX-2 in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells coincided with an increase in COX-2 expression in lesional macrophages and increased biosynthesis of thromboxane. Increased accumulation of less organized intimal collagen, laminin, α-smooth muscle actin, and matrix-rich fibrosis was also apparent in lesions of the mutants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>Although atherogenesis is accelerated in global COX-2 knockouts, consistent with evidence of risk transformation during chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">mask</span></strong>s the contrasting effects of enzyme depletion in macrophages versus vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Targeting delivery of COX-2 inhibitors to macrophages may conserve their efficacy while limiting cardiovascular risk.</p></sec>

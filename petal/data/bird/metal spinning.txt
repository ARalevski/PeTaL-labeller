Revealing hidden spin-momentum locking in a high-temperature cuprate superconductor
<p>Cuprate superconductors have long been thought of as having strong electronic correlations but negligible <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-orbit coupling. Using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we discovered that one of the most studied cuprate superconductors, Bi2212, has a nontrivial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> texture with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-momentum locking that circles the Brillouin zone center and a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-layer locking that allows states of opposite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> to be localized in different parts of the unit cell. Our findings pose challenges for the vast majority of models of cuprates, such as the Hubbard model and its variants, where <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-orbit interaction has been mostly neglected, and open the intriguing question of how the high-temperature superconducting state emerges in the presence of this nontrivial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> texture.</p>

Control and local measurement of the spin chemical potential in a magnetic insulator
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> chemical potential characterizes the tendency of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>s to diffuse. Probing this quantity could provide insight into materials such as magnetic insulators and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> liquids and aid optimization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>tronic devices. Here we introduce single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> magnetometry as a generic platform for nonperturbative, nanoscale characterization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> chemical potentials. We experimentally realize this platform using diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers and use it to investigate magnons in a magnetic insulator, finding that the magnon chemical potential can be controlled by driving the system’s ferromagnetic resonance. We introduce a symmetry-based two-fluid theory describing the underlying magnon processes, measure the local thermomagnonic torque, and illustrate the detection sensitivity using electrically controlled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> injection. Our results pave the way for nanoscale control and imaging of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> transport in mesoscopic systems.</p>

A coherent Ising machine for 2000-node optimization problems
<p>The analysis and optimization of complex systems can be reduced to mathematical problems collectively known as combinatorial optimization. Many such problems can be mapped onto ground-state search problems of the Ising model, and various artificial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> systems are now emerging as promising approaches. However, physical Ising machines have suffered from limited numbers of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> couplings because of implementations based on localized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>s, resulting in severe scalability problems.

Using a measurement and feedback scheme, we coupled time-multiplexed degenerate optical parametric oscillators to implement maximum cut problems on arbitrary graph topologies with up to 2000 nodes. Our coherent Ising machine outperformed simulated annealing in terms of accuracy and computation time for a 2000-node complete graph.</p>

Magneto-Seebeck tunneling on the atomic scale
<p>The tunneling of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-polarized electrons across a magnetic tunnel junction driven by a temperature gradient is a fundamental process for the thermal control of electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> transport. We experimentally investigated the atomic-scale details of this magneto-Seebeck tunneling by placing a magnetic probe tip in close proximity to a magnetic sample at cryogenic temperature, with a vacuum as the tunneling barrier. Heating the tip and measuring the thermopower of the junction while scanning across the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> texture of the sample lead to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-resolved Seebeck coefficients that can be mapped at atomic-scale lateral resolution. We propose a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> detector for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>tronics applications that is driven solely by waste heat, using magneto-Seebeck tunneling to convert <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> information into a voltage that can be used for further data processing.</p>

Strong spin-photon coupling in silicon
<p>Long coherence times of single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>s in silicon quantum dots make these systems highly attractive for quantum computation, but how to scale up <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> qubit systems remains an open question. As a first step to address this issue, we demonstrate the strong coupling of a single electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> and a single microwave photon. The electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave photon is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric field component of the cavity photon couples directly to the charge dipole of the electron in the double dot, and indirectly to the electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet. Our results provide a route to realizing large networks of quantum dot–based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> qubit registers.</p>

Spin transport in a Mott insulator of ultracold fermions
<p>Strongly correlated materials are expected to feature unconventional transport properties, such that charge, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>, and heat conduction are potentially independent probes of the dynamics. In contrast to charge transport, the measurement of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> transport in such materials is highly challenging. We observed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> conduction and diffusion in a system of ultracold fermionic atoms that realizes the half-filled Fermi-Hubbard model. For strong interactions, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> diffusion is driven by super-exchange and doublon-hole–assisted tunneling, and strongly violates the quantum limit of charge diffusion. The technique developed in this work can be extended to finite doping, which can shed light on the complex interplay between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> and charge in the Hubbard model.</p>

Imaging of pure spin-valley diffusion current in WS<sub>2</sub>-WSe<sub>2</sub> heterostructures
<p>Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials are promising for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>tronic and valleytronic applications because valley-polarized excitations can be generated and manipulated with circularly polarized photons and the valley and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> degrees of freedom are locked by strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-orbital interactions. In this study we demonstrate efficient generation of a pure and locked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-valley diffusion current in tungsten disulfide (WS<sub>2</sub>)–tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>) heterostructures without any driving electric field. We imaged the propagation of valley current in real time and space by pump-probe spectroscopy. The valley current in the heterostructures can live for more than 20 microseconds and propagate over 20 micrometers; both the lifetime and the diffusion length can be controlled through electrostatic gating. The high-efficiency and electric-field–free generation of a locked <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-valley current in TMDC heterostructures holds promise for applications in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> and valley devices.</p>

Disorder-induced optical transition from spin Hall to random Rashba effect
<p>Disordered structures give rise to intriguing phenomena owing to the complex nature of their interaction with light. We report on photonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-symmetry breaking and unexpected <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-optical transport phenomena arising from subwavelength-scale disordered geometric phase structure. Weak disorder induces a photonic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> Hall effect, observed via quantum weak measurements, whereas strong disorder leads to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-split modes in momentum space, a random optical Rashba effect. Study of the momentum space entropy reveals an optical transition upon reaching a critical point where the structure’s anisotropy axis vanishes. Incorporation of singular topology into the disordered structure demonstrates repulsive vortex interaction depending on the disorder strength. The photonic disordered geometric phase can serve as a platform for the study of different phenomena emerging from complex media involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-orbit coupling.</p>

Spin coating epitaxial films
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-coated films, such as photoresists for lithography or perovskite films for solar cells, are either amorphous or polycrystalline. We show that epitaxial films of inorganic materials such as cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>), lead(II) iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and sodium chloride (NaCl) can be deposited onto a variety of single-crystal and single-crystal–like substrates by simply <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> coating either solutions of the material or precursors to the material. The out-of-plane and in-plane orientations of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-coated films are determined by the substrate. The thin stagnant layer of supersaturated solution produced during <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> coating promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the material onto the single-crystal substrate over homogeneous nucleation in the bulk solution, and ordered anion adlayers may lower the activation energy for nucleation on the surface. The method can be used to produce functional materials such as inorganic semiconductors or to deposit water-soluble materials such as NaCl that can serve as growth templates.</p>

Hyperfine interaction of individual atoms on a surface

Two-dimensional sp<sup>2</sup> carbon–conjugated covalent organic frameworks

The C=C linkages topologically connect pyrene knots at regular intervals into a 2D lattice with π conjugations extended along both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions and develop an eclipsed layer framework rather than the more conventionally obtained disordered structures. The sp<sup>2</sup>c-COF is a semiconductor with a discrete band gap of 1.9 electron volts and can be chemically oxidized to enhance conductivity by 12 orders of magnitude.

Revealing hidden antiferromagnetic correlations in doped Hubbard chains via string correlators
<p>Topological phases, like the Haldane phase in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-1 chains, defy characterization through local order parameters.

Similar diluted magnetic correlations appear in doped one-dimensional lattice systems owing to the phenomenon of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-charge separation. Here we report on the direct observation of such hidden magnetic correlations via quantum gas microscopy of hole-doped ultracold Fermi-Hubbard chains.

Bismuthene on a SiC substrate: A candidate for a high-temperature quantum spin Hall material

Counter-propagating charge transport in the quantum Hall effect regime
<p>The quantum Hall effect, observed in a two-dimensional (2D) electron gas subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field, imposes a 1D-like chiral, downstream, transport of charge carriers along the sample edges. Although this picture remains valid for electrons and Laughlin’s fractional quasiparticles, it no longer holds for quasiparticles in the so-called hole-conjugate states. These states are expected, when disorder and interactions are weak, to harbor upstream charge modes. However, so far, charge currents were observed to flow exclusively downstream in the quantum Hall regime. Studying the canonical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-polarized and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-unpolarized <i>v</i> = 2/3 hole-like states in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures, we observed a significant upstream charge current at short propagation distances in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> unpolarized state.</p>

Separation of enantiomers by their enantiospecific interaction with achiral magnetic substrates
<p>It is commonly assumed that recognition and discrimination of chirality, both in nature and in artificial systems, depend solely on spatial effects. However, recent studies have suggested that charge redistribution in chiral molecules manifests an enantiospecific preference in electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> orientation. We therefore reasoned that the induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> polarization may affect enantiorecognition through exchange interactions. Here we show experimentally that the interaction of chiral molecules with a perpendicularly magnetized substrate is enantiospecific. Thus, one enantiomer adsorbs preferentially when the magnetic dipole is pointing up, whereas the other adsorbs faster for the opposite alignment of the magnetization. The interaction is not controlled by the magnetic field per se, but rather by the electron <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> orientations, and opens prospects for a distinct approach to enantiomeric separations.</p>

A single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory
<p>Single-photon switches and transistors generate strong photon-photon interactions that are essential for quantum circuits and networks. However, the deterministic control of an optical signal with a single photon requires strong interactions with a quantum memory, which has been challenging to achieve in a solid-state platform. We demonstrate a single-photon switch and transistor enabled by a solid-state quantum memory. Our device consists of a semiconductor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> qubit strongly coupled to a nanophotonic cavity. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> qubit enables a single 63-picosecond gate photon to switch a signal field containing up to an average of 27.7 photons before the internal state of the device resets. Our results show that semiconductor nanophotonic devices can produce strong and controlled photon-photon interactions that could enable high-bandwidth photonic quantum information processing.</p>

Giant tunneling magnetoresistance in spin-filter van der Waals heterostructures
<p>Magnetic multilayer devices that exploit magnetoresistance are the backbone of magnetic sensing and data storage technologies. Here, we report multiple-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-filter magnetic tunnel junctions (sf-MTJs) based on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures in which atomically thin chromium triiodide (CrI<sub>3</sub>) acts as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-filter tunnel barrier sandwiched between graphene contacts. We demonstrate tunneling magnetoresistance that is drastically enhanced with increasing CrI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness, reaching a record 19,000% for magnetic multilayer structures using four-layer sf-MTJs at low temperatures. Using magnetic circular dichroism measurements, we attribute these effects to the intrinsic layer-by-layer antiferromagnetic ordering of the atomically thin CrI<sub>3</sub>. Our work reveals the possibility to push magnetic information storage to the atomically thin limit and highlights CrI<sub>3</sub> as a superlative magnetic tunnel barrier for vdW heterostructure <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>tronic devices.</p>

Evidence for a quantum dipole liquid state in an organic quasi–two-dimensional material
<p>Mott insulators are commonly pictured with electrons localized on lattice sites, with their low-energy degrees of freedom involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>s only. Here, we observe emergent charge degrees of freedom in a molecule-based Mott insulator κ-(BEDT-TTF)<sub>2</sub>Hg(SCN)<sub>2</sub>Br, resulting in a quantum dipole liquid state. Electrons localized on molecular dimer lattice sites form electric dipoles that do not order at low temperatures and fluctuate with frequency detected experimentally in our Raman spectroscopy experiments. The heat capacity and Raman scattering response are consistent with a scenario in which the composite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> and electric dipole degrees of freedom remain fluctuating down to the lowest measured temperatures.</p>

Spatially distributed multipartite entanglement enables EPR steering of atomic clouds
<p>A key resource for distributed quantum-enhanced protocols is entanglement between spatially separated modes. However, the robust generation and detection of entanglement between spatially separated regions of an ultracold atomic system remain a challenge. We used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> mixing in a tightly confined Bose-Einstein condensate to generate an entangled state of indistinguishable particles in a single spatial mode. We show experimentally that this entanglement can be spatially distributed by self-similar expansion of the atomic cloud. We used spatially resolved <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> read-out to reveal a particularly strong form of quantum correlations known as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between distinct parts of the expanded cloud. Based on the strength of EPR steering, we constructed a witness, which confirmed genuine 5-partite entanglement.</p>

Spatial entanglement patterns and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in Bose-Einstein condensates
<p>Many-particle entanglement is a fundamental concept of quantum physics that still presents conceptual challenges. Although nonclassical states of atomic ensembles were used to enhance measurement precision in quantum metrology, the notion of entanglement in these systems was debated because the correlations among the indistinguishable atoms were witnessed by collective measurements only. Here, we use high-resolution imaging to directly measure the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> correlations between spatially separated parts of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-squeezed Bose-Einstein condensate. We observe entanglement that is strong enough for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering: We can predict measurement outcomes for noncommuting observables in one spatial region on the basis of corresponding measurements in another region with an inferred uncertainty product below the Heisenberg uncertainty bound. This method could be exploited for entanglement-enhanced imaging of electromagnetic field distributions and quantum information tasks.</p>

Observation of topological superconductivity on the surface of an iron-based superconductor
<p>Topological superconductors are predicted to host exotic Majorana states that obey non-Abelian statistics and can be used to implement a topological quantum computer. Most of the proposed topological superconductors are realized in difficult-to-fabricate heterostructures at very low temperatures. By using high-resolution <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-resolved and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, we find that the iron-based superconductor FeTe<sub>1–</sub><i><sub>x</sub></i>Se<i><sub>x</sub></i> (<i>x</i> = 0.45; superconducting transition temperature <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 14.5 kelvin) hosts Dirac-cone–type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-helical surface states at the Fermi level; the surface states exhibit an s-wave superconducting gap below <i>T</i><sub>c</sub>.

Real-time imaging of DNA loop extrusion by condensin

We directly visualized the formation and processive extension of DNA loops by yeast condensin in real time. Our findings constitute unambiguous evidence for loop extrusion. We observed that a single condensin complex is able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extrud</span></strong>e tens of kilobase pairs of DNA at a force-dependent speed of up to 1500 base pairs per second, using the energy of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. Condensin-induced loop extrusion was strictly asymmetric, which demonstrates that condensin anchors onto DNA and reels it in from only one side. Active DNA loop extrusion by SMC complexes may provide the universal unifying principle for genome organization.</p>

Anomalous spin correlations and excitonic instability of interacting 2D Weyl fermions
<p>The Coulomb interaction in systems of quasi-relativistic massless electrons has an unscreened long-range component at variance with conventional correlated metals. We used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements to reveal unusual <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> correlations of two-dimensional Weyl fermions in an organic material, causing a divergent increase of the Korringa ratio by a factor of 1000 upon cooling, in marked contrast to conventional metallic behavior. Combined with model calculations, we show that this divergence stems from an interaction-driven velocity renormalization that almost exclusively suppresses zero-momentum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> fluctuations. At low temperatures, the NMR relaxation rate shows an unexpected increase; numerical analyses show that this increase corresponds to internode excitonic fluctuations, a precursor to a transition from massless to massive quasiparticles.</p>

Arbitrary spin-to–orbital angular momentum conversion of light
<p>Optical elements that convert the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> angular momentum (SAM) of light into vortex beams have found applications in classical and quantum optics. These elements—SAM-to–orbital angular momentum (OAM) converters—are based on the geometric phase and only permit the conversion of left- and right-circular polarizations (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> states) into states with opposite OAM. We present a method for converting arbitrary SAM states into total angular momentum states characterized by a superposition of independent OAM. We designed a metasurface that converts left- and right-circular polarizations into states with independent values of OAM and designed another device that performs this operation for elliptically polarized states. These results illustrate a general material-mediated connection between SAM and OAM of light and may find applications in producing complex structured light and in optical communication.</p>

A parity-breaking electronic nematic phase transition in the spin-orbit coupled metal Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
<p>Strong electron interactions can drive metallic systems toward a variety of well-known symmetry-broken phases, but the instabilities of correlated metals with strong <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-orbit coupling have only recently begun to be explored. We uncovered a multipolar nematic phase of matter in the metallic pyrochlore Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> using spatially resolved second-harmonic optical anisotropy measurements. Like previously discovered electronic nematic phases, this multipolar phase spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry while preserving translational invariance. However, it has the distinguishing property of being odd under spatial inversion, which is allowed only in the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-orbit coupling. By examining the critical behavior of the multipolar nematic order parameter, we show that it drives the thermal phase transition near 200 kelvin in Cd<sub>2</sub>Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and induces a parity-breaking lattice distortion as a secondary order.</p>

Deterministic entanglement generation from driving through quantum phase transitions
<p>Many-body entanglement is often created through the system evolution, aided by nonlinear interactions between the constituting particles. These very dynamics, however, can also lead to fluctuations and degradation of the entanglement if the interactions cannot be controlled. Here, we demonstrate near-deterministic generation of an entangled twin-Fock condensate of ~11,000 atoms by driving a<sub> </sub>arubidium-87 Bose-Einstein condensate undergoing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> mixing through two consecutive quantum phase transitions (QPTs). We directly observe number squeezing of 10.7 ± 0.6 decibels and normalized collective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> length of 0.99 ± 0.01. Together, these observations allow us to infer an entanglement-enhanced phase sensitivity of ~6 decibels beyond the standard quantum limit and an entanglement breadth of ~910 atoms. Our work highlights the power of generating large-scale useful entanglement by taking advantage of the different entanglement landscapes separated by QPTs.</p>

Robust spin-polarized midgap states at step edges of topological crystalline insulators
<p>Topological crystalline insulators are materials in which the crystalline symmetry leads to topologically protected surface states with a chiral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> texture, rendering them potential candidates for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>tronics applications. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we uncover the existence of one-dimensional (1D) midgap states at odd-atomic surface step edges of the three-dimensional topological crystalline insulator (Pb,Sn)Se. A minimal toy model and realistic tight-binding calculations identify them as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>-polarized flat bands connecting two Dirac points. This nontrivial origin provides the 1D midgap states with inherent stability and protects them from backscattering. We experimentally show that this stability results in a striking robustness to defects, strong magnetic fields, and elevated temperature.</p>

A controllable crossover between 2D and 1D SO couplings is studied, and the SO effects and nontrivial band topology are observed by measuring the atomic cloud distribution and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong> texture in momentum space. Our realization of 2D SO coupling with advantages of small heating and topological stability opens a broad avenue in cold atoms to study exotic quantum phases, including topological superfluids.</p>

Second Chern number of a quantum-simulated non-Abelian Yang monopole

By displacing the manifold, we induce and observe a topological transition, where the topology of the manifold changes to a trivial state.</p>

We further measure inelastic tunneling spectra for our junctions, unveiling a rich spectrum consistent with collective magnetic excitations (magnons) in CrI<sub>3</sub>.</p>

Molecular structure of human P-glycoprotein in the ATP-bound, outward-facing conformation

P-glycoprotein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">extrud</span></strong>es toxic molecules and drugs from cells through ATP-powered conformational changes. Despite decades of effort, only the structures of the inward-facing conformation of P-glycoprotein are available. Here we present the structure of human P-glycoprotein in the outward-facing conformation, determined by cryo–electron microscopy at 3.4-angstrom resolution. The two nucleotide-binding domains form a closed dimer occluding two ATP molecules. The drug-binding cavity observed in the inward-facing structures is reorientated toward the extracellular space and compressed to preclude substrate binding. This observation indicates that ATP binding, not hydrolysis, promotes substrate release. The structure evokes a model in which the dynamic nature of P-glycoprotein enables translocation of a large variety of substrates.</p>

Observation of the quantum spin Hall effect up to 100 kelvin in a monolayer crystal

Moreover, a magnetic field suppresses the conductance, and the observed Zeeman-type gap indicates the existence of a Kramers degenerate point and the importance of time-reversal symmetry for protection from elastic backscattering. Our results establish the QSHE at temperatures much higher than in semiconductor heterostructures and allow for exploring topological phases in atomically thin crystals.</p>

Numerical evidence of fluctuating stripes in the normal state of high-<i>T</i><sub>c</sub> cuprate superconductors
<p>Upon doping, Mott insulators often exhibit symmetry breaking where charge carriers and their <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">spin</span></strong>s organize into patterns known as stripes. For high–transition temperature cuprate superconductors, stripes are widely suspected to exist in a fluctuating form. We used numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations to demonstrate dynamical stripe correlations in the three-band Hubbard model, which represents the local electronic structure of the copper-oxygen plane. Our results, which are robust to varying parameters, cluster size, and boundary conditions, support the interpretation of experimental observations such as the hourglass magnetic dispersion and the Yamada plot of incommensurability versus doping in terms of the physics of fluctuating stripes. These findings provide a different perspective on the intertwined orders emerging from the cuprates’ normal state.</p>

The measured product distribution covers about 90% of the final products, and we are able to discriminate between product states with a level splitting as small as 20 megahertz multiplied by Planck’s constant. Furthermore, we formulate propensity rules for the distribution of products, and we develop a theoretical model that predicts many of our experimental observations.

Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states in bilayer graphene

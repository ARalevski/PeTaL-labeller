Plant Chemical Genetics: From Phenotype-Based Screens to Synthetic Biology
<p>The treatment of a biological system with small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es to specifically perturb cellular functions is commonly referred to as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al biology. Small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are used commercially as drugs, herbicides, and fungicides in different systems, but in recent years they are increasingly exploited as tools for basic research. For instance, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al genetics involves the discovery of small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e effectors of various cellular functions through screens of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> libraries. Whereas the drug discovery field has largely been driven by target-based screening approaches followed by drug optimization, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al genetics in plant systems tends to be fueled by more general phenotype-based screens, opening the possibility to identify a wide range of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that are not necessarily directly linked to the process of interest. Here, we provide an overview of the current progress in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al genetics in plants, with a focus on the discoveries regarding small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es identified in screens designed with a basic biology perspective. We reflect on the possibilities that lie ahead and discuss some of the potential pitfalls that might be encountered upon adopting a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al genetics approach.</p>

CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart disease is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV disease (MVD), the cellular and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we examined specimens from patients with rheumatic heart disease to correlate our findings to human pathology.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart disease valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es including arginase-1 and resistin-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD. TNF acted through TNF receptor–1 expressed on valve-resident cells to increase the expression of vascular cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–1. Conditionally deleting the vascular cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e-1 ligand very late antigen–4 from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs prevented MVD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs are key drivers of autoimmune MVD in K/B.g7 mice and are also present in human rheumatic heart disease. We define key inflammatory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that drive MVD in this model, including Syk, TNF, interleukin-6, very late antigen–4, and vascular cell adhesion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–1.</p></sec>

Covalent inhibitors of EGFR family protein kinases induce degradation of human Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) pseudokinase in cancer cells
<p>A major challenge associated with bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al and cellular analysis of pseudokinases is a lack of target-validated small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s with which to probe function. Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with a diverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There is substantial evidence that human TRIB2 promotes survival and drug resistance in solid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutic target. The unusual TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-rich C-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminal tail, which also supports its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases. We found that TRIB2 is a target of previously described small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e protein kinase inhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinase domains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Using a thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB2-binding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s within the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and used a drug repurposing approach to classify <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB2 in vitro. TRIB2 destabilizing agents, including the covalent drug afatinib, led to rapid TRIB2 degradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signaling and survival. Our data reveal new drug leads for the development of TRIB2-degrading <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s, which will also be invaluable for unraveling the cellular mechanisms of TRIB2-based signaling. Our study highlights that small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–induced protein down-regulation through drug “off-targets” might be relevant for other inhibitors that serendipitously target pseudokinases.</p>

Real-space and real-time observation of a plasmon-induced chemical reaction of a single molecule
<p>Plasmon-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al reactions of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es adsorbed on metal nanostructures are attracting increased attention for photocatalytic reactions. However, the mechanism remains controversial because of the difficulty of direct observation of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al reactions in the plasmonic field, which is strongly localized near the metal surface. We used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to achieve real-space and real-time observation of a plasmon-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al reaction at the single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e level.

Identification and Metabolite Profiling of Chemical Activators of Lipid Accumulation in Green Algae
<p>Microalgae are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing biofuels and coproducts. However, several limitations must be overcome before algae-based production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce lipid accumulation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this barrier, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s were screened against <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, and 243 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s were identified that increase triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation without terminating growth. Identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s were classified by structural similarity, and 15 were selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth fitness, photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch concentrations. TAG accumulation was verified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantification of total fatty acids, and targeted TAG and galactolipid measurements were performed using liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry. These results demonstrated that TAG accumulation does not necessarily proceed at the expense of galactolipid. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into pathway shifts due to five different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> treatments and verified the anabolic state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic stresses commonly used to induce oil accumulation in algae. The efficacy of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s also was demonstrated in three other algal species. These lipid-inducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al mechanisms of lipid accumulation in algae and a direct means to improve algal oil content independent of the severe growth limitations associated with nutrient deprivation.</p>

Single-molecule diffusion-based estimation of ligand effects on G protein–coupled receptors
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets. Developing a method to measure the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface; thus, changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es, which depend on the signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are often used as an index of receptor activity. We show that single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing the effects of ligands on GPCRs. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we monitored the dynamics of the diffusion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions. Our single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e tracking analysis demonstrated that increases and decreases in the average diffusion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflected the ligand-dependent inactivation and activation of receptors, respectively. Through experiments with inhibitors and dual-color single-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e imaging analysis, we found that the diffusion of receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es was altered by common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding, and receptor accumulation in clathrin-coated pits. We also confirmed that agonist also decreased the average diffusion coefficient for class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that this parameter is a good index for estimating ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of their phylogenetic groups, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al properties of the ligands, or G protein–coupling selectivity.</p>

Discovery and inhibition of an interspecies gut bacterial pathway for Levodopa metabolism
<p>The human gut microbiota metabolizes the Parkinson’s disease medication Levo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopa</span></strong> (<sc>l</sc>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopa</span></strong>), potentially reducing drug availability and causing side effects. However, the organisms, genes, and enzymes responsible for this activity in patients and their susceptibility to inhibition by host-targeted drugs are unknown. Here, we describe an interspecies pathway for gut bacterial <sc>l</sc>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopa</span></strong> metabolism. Conversion of <sc>l</sc>-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopa</span></strong> to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopa</span></strong>mine by a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent tyrosine decarboxylase from <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> is followed by transformation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dopa</span></strong>mine to <i>m</i>-tyramine by a molybdenum-dependent dehydroxylase from <i>Eggerthella lenta</i>. These enzymes predict drug metabolism in complex human gut microbiotas.

Probing and imaging spin interactions with a magnetic single-molecule sensor
<p>Magnetic single atoms and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es are receiving intensifying research focus because of their potential as the smallest possible memory, spintronic, and qubit elements. Scanning probe microscopes used to study these systems have benefited greatly from new techniques that use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e-functionalized tips to enhance spatial and spectroscopic resolutions and enable new sensing capabilities.

A degenerate Fermi gas of polar molecules

Identification of Novel Growth Regulators in Plant Populations Expressing Random Peptides
<p>The use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al genomics approaches allows the identification of small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that integrate into biological systems, thereby changing discrete processes that influence growth, development, or metabolism. Libraries of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>als are applied to living systems, and changes in phenotype are observed, potentially leading to the identification of new growth regulators. This work describes an approach that is the nexus of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al genomics and synthetic biology. Here, each plant in an extensive population synthesizes a unique small peptide arising from a transgene composed of a randomized nucleic acid sequence core flanked by translational start, stop, and cysteine-encoding (for disulfide cyclization) sequences. Ten and 16 amino acid sequences, bearing a core of six and 12 random amino acids, have been synthesized in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants. Populations were screened for phenotypes from the seedling stage through senescence. Dozens of phenotypes were observed in over 2,000 plants analyzed. Ten conspicuous phenotypes were verified through separate transformation and analysis of multiple independent lines. The results indicate that these populations contain sequences that often influence discrete aspects of plant biology. Novel peptides that affect photosynthesis, flowering, and red light response are described. The challenge now is to identify the mechanistic integrations of these peptides into bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al processes. These populations serve as a new tool to identify small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that modulate discrete plant functions that could be produced later in transgenic plants or potentially applied exogenously to impart their effects. These findings could usher in a new generation of agricultural growth regulators, herbicides, or defense <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s.</p>

Identification of Toll-like receptor signaling inhibitors based on selective activation of hierarchically acting signaling proteins
<p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize various pathogen- and host tissue–derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es and initiate inflammatory immune responses. Exaggerated or prolonged TLR activation, however, can lead to etiologically diverse diseases, such as bacterial sepsis, metabolic and autoimmune diseases, or stroke. Despite the apparent medical need, no small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e drugs against TLR pathways are clinically available. This may be because of the complex signaling mechanisms of TLRs, which are governed by a series of protein-protein interactions initiated by Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology domains (TIR) found in TLRs and the cytoplasmic adaptor proteins TIRAP and MyD88. Oligomerization of TLRs with MyD88 or TIRAP leads to the recruitment of members of the IRAK family of kinases and the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. We developed a phenotypic drug screening system based on the inducible homodimerization of either TIRAP, MyD88, or TRAF6, that ranked hits according to their hierarchy of action. From a bioactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> library, we identified methyl-piperidino-pyrazole (MPP) as a TLR-specific inhibitor. Structure-activity relationship analysis, quantitative proteomics, protein-protein interaction assays, and cellular thermal shift assays suggested that MPP targets the TIR domain of MyD88. Chemical evolution of the original MPP scaffold generated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s with selectivity for distinct TLRs that interfered with specific TIR interactions. Administration of an MPP analog to mice protected them from TLR4-dependent inflammation. These results validate this phenotypic screening approach and suggest that the MPP scaffold could serve as a starting point for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>

Multiplex quantitative assays indicate a need for reevaluating reported small-molecule TrkB agonists
<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), have emerged as key regulators of brain plasticity and represent disease-modifying targets for several brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and major depressive disorder. Because of poor pharmacokinetic properties of BDNF, the interest in small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e TrkB agonists and modulators is high. Several <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s have been reported to act as TrkB agonists, and their increasing use in various nervous system disorder models creates the perception that these are reliable probes.

Infrared Nanospectroscopy Reveals the Chemical Nature of Pit Membranes in Water-Conducting Cells of the Plant Xylem
<p>In the xylem of angiosperm plants, microscopic pits through the secondary cell walls connect the water-conducting vessels. Cellulosic meshes originated from primary walls, and middle lamella between adjacent vessels, called the pit membrane, separates one conduit from another. The intricate structure of the nano-sized pores in pit membranes enables the passage of water under negative pressure without hydraulic failure due to obstruction by gas bubbles (i.e. embolism) under normal conditions or mild drought stress. Since the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al composition of pit membranes affects embolism formation and bubble behavior, we directly measured pit membrane composition in <i>Populus nigra</i> wood. Here, we characterized the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al composition of cell wall structures by synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy and atomic force microscopy-infrared nanospectroscopy with high spatial resolution. Characteristic peaks of cellulose, phenolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s, and proteins were found in the intervessel pit membranes of <i>P. nigra</i> wood. In addition, the vessel to parenchyma pit membranes and developing cell walls of the vascular cambium showed clear signals of cellulose, proteins, and pectin. We did not find a distinct peak of lignin and other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s in these structures. Our investigation of the complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al composition of intervessel pit membranes furthers our understanding of the flow of water and bubbles between neighboring conduits. The advances presented here pave the way for further label-free studies related to the nanochemistry of plant cell components.</p>

Screening for Biologically Annotated Drugs That Trigger Triacylglycerol Accumulation in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i>
<p>Microalgae are a promising feedstock for the production of triacylglycerol (TAG) for a variety of potential applications, ranging from food and human health to biofuels and green chemistry. However, obtaining high TAG yields is challenging. A phenotypic assay for the accumulation of oil droplets was developed to screen a library of 1,200 drugs, annotated with pharmacology information, to select <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s that trigger TAG accumulation in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Using this screen, we identified 34 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es acting in a dose-dependent manner. Previously characterized targets of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s include cell division and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s possibly acting on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen that is used in contraceptive pills and known for its ecological impact as an endocrine disruptor. Ethynylestradiol impaired the production of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, destabilized the galactolipid versus phospholipid balance, and triggered the recycling of fatty acids from membrane lipids to TAG. The <i>P. tricornutum</i> transcriptomic response to treatment with ethynylestradiol was consistent with the reallocation of carbon from sterols to acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of action and catabolism of ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regulated cytochrome P450 proteins. A fatty acid elongase, Δ6-ELO-B1, might be involved in the impairment of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid turnover. This phenotypic screen opens new perspectives for the exploration of novel bioactive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es, potential target genes, and pathways controlling TAG biosynthesis. It also unraveled the sensitivity of diatoms to endocrine disruptors, highlighting an impact of anthropogenic pollution on phytoplankton.</p>

Carnosic Acid and Carnosol, Two Major Antioxidants of Rosemary, Act through Different Mechanisms
<p>Carnosic acid, a phenolic diterpene specific to the Lamiaceae family, is highly abundant in rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i>). Despite numerous industrial and medicinal/pharmaceutical applications of its antioxidative features, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> in planta and its antioxidant mechanism have received little attention, except a few studies of rosemary plants under natural conditions. In vitro analyses, using high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet and luminescence imaging, revealed that carnosic acid and its major oxidized derivative, carnosol, protect lipids from oxidation. Both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s preserved linolenic acid and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol from singlet oxygen and from hydroxyl radical. When applied exogenously, they were both able to protect thylakoid membranes prepared from Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves against lipid peroxidation. Different levels of carnosic acid and carnosol in two contrasting rosemary varieties correlated with tolerance to lipid peroxidation. Upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) oxidation of lipids, carnosic acid was consumed and oxidized into various derivatives, including into carnosol, while carnosol resisted, suggesting that carnosic acid is a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al quencher of ROS. The antioxidative function of carnosol relies on another mechanism, occurring directly in the lipid oxidation process. Under oxidative conditions that did not involve ROS generation, carnosol inhibited lipid peroxidation, contrary to carnosic acid. Using spin probes and electron paramagnetic resonance detection, we confirmed that carnosic acid, rather than carnosol, is a ROS quencher. Various oxidized derivatives of carnosic acid were detected in rosemary leaves in low light, indicating chronic oxidation of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>, and accumulated in plants exposed to stress conditions, in parallel with a loss of carnosic acid, confirming that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al quenching of ROS by carnosic acid takes place in planta.</p>

Functional Diversification of Kaurene Synthase-Like Genes in <i>Isodon rubescens</i><xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p><i>Ent</i>-kaurene diterpenoids are the largest group of known <i>Isodon</i> diterpenoids. Among them, oridonin is accumulated in the leaves, and is the most frequently studied <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> because of its antitumor and antibacterial activities. We have identified five copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) and six kaurene synthase-like (KSL) genes by transcriptome profiling of <i>Isodon rubescens</i> leaves. An in vitro assay assigns ten of them to five different diterpene biosynthesis pathways, except IrCPS3 that has a mutation in the catalytic motif. The Lamiaceae-specific clade genes (IrCPS1 and IrCPS2) synthesize the intermediate copalyl diphosphate (normal-CPP), while IrCPS4 and IrCPS5 synthesize the intermediate <i>ent</i>-copalyl diphosphate (<i>ent</i>-CPP). IrKSL2, IrKSL4, and IrKSL5 react with <i>ent</i>-CPP to produce an <i>ent</i>-isopimaradiene-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>, <i>ent</i>-atiserene and <i>ent</i>-kaurene, respectively. Correspondingly, the Lamiaceae-specific clade genes IrKSL1 or IrKSL3 combined with normal-CPP led to the formation of miltiradiene. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> then underwent aromatization and oxidization with a cytochrome P450 forming two related <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s, abietatriene and ferruginol, which were detected in the root bark. IrKSL6 reacts with normal-CPP to produce isopimaradiene. IrKSL3 and IrKSL6 have the γβα tridomain structure, as these proteins tend to possess the bidomain structure of IrKSL1, highlighting the evolutionary history of KSL gene domain loss and further elucidating <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al diversity evolution from a macroevolutionary stance in Lamiaceae.</p>

Bumblebees are not deterred by ecologically relevant concentrations of nectar toxins
<p>Bees visit flowers to collect nectar and pollen that contain nutrients and simultaneously facilitate plant sexual reproduction. Paradoxically, nectar produced to attract pollinators often contains deterrent or toxic plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s associated with herbivore defence. The functional significance of these nectar toxins is not fully understood, but they may have a negative impact on pollinator behaviour and health, and, ultimately, plant pollination. This study investigates whether a generalist bumblebee, <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, can detect naturally occurring concentrations of nectar toxins. Using paired-choice experiments, we identified deterrence thresholds for five <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s found in the nectar of bee-pollinated plants: quinine, caffeine, nicotine, amygdalin and grayanotoxin. The deterrence threshold was determined when bumblebees significantly preferred a sucrose solution over a sucrose solution containing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>. Bumblebees had the lowest deterrence threshold for the alkaloid quinine (0.01 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>); all other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s had higher deterrence thresholds, above the natural concentration range in floral nectar. Our data, combined with previous work using honeybees, suggest that generalist bee species have poor acuity for the detection of nectar toxins. The fact that bees do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s likely indicates that it is difficult for them to learn to associate floral traits with the presence of toxins, thus maintaining this trait in plant populations.</p>

Screening of Odor-Receptor Pairs in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> Reveals Different Receptors for High and Low Odor Concentrations

Spatially structured cell populations process multiple sensory signals in parallel in intact vascular endothelium
<p>Blood flow, blood clotting, angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular remodeling are each controlled by a large number of variable, noisy, and interacting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al inputs to the vascular endothelium. The endothelium processes the entirety of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al composition to which the cardiovascular system is exposed, carrying out sophisticated computations that determine physiological output. Processing this enormous quantity of information is a major challenge facing the endothelium. We analyzed the responses of hundreds of endothelial cells to carbachol (CCh) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and found that the endothelium segregates the responses to these two distinct components of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al environment into separate streams of complementary information that are processed in parallel. Sensitivities to CCh and ATP mapped to different clusters of cells, and each agonist generated distinct signal patterns. The distinct signals were features of agonist activation rather than properties of the cells themselves. When there was more than one stimulus present, the cells communicated and combined inputs to generate new distinct signals that were nonlinear combinations of the inputs. Our results demonstrate that the endothelium is a structured, collaborative sensory network that simplifies the complex environment using separate cell clusters that are sensitive to distinct aspects of the overall bio<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al environment and interactively compute signals from diverse but interrelated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al inputs. These features enable the endothelium to selectively process separate signals and perform multiple computations in an environment that is noisy and variable.</p>

Identification of a selective small-molecule inhibitor of type 1 adenylyl cyclase activity with analgesic properties
<p>Adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) belongs to a group of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) that are stimulated by calcium in a calmodulin-dependent manner. Studies with AC1 knockout mice suggest that inhibitors of AC1 may be useful for treating pain and opioid dependence. However, nonselective inhibition of AC isoforms could result in substantial adverse effects. We used <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al library screening to identify a selective AC1 inhibitor with a chromone core structure that may represent a new analgesic agent. After demonstrating that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> (ST034307) inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably transfected with AC1 (HEK-AC1 cells), we confirmed selectivity for AC1 by testing against all isoforms of membrane-bound ACs. ST034307 also inhibited AC1 activity stimulated by forskolin- and Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors in HEK-AC1 cells and showed inhibitory activity in multiple AC1-containing membrane preparations and mouse hippocampal homogenates. ST034307 enhanced μ-opioid receptor (MOR)–mediated inhibition of AC1 in short-term inhibition assays in HEK-AC1 cells stably transfected with MOR; however, the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> blocked heterologous sensitization of AC1 caused by chronic MOR activation in these cells. ST034307 reduced pain responses in a mouse model of inflammatory pain.

Toward a chemical vaccine for malaria
<p>Despite considerable progress in combating malaria, it remains one of the world's most important infectious diseases, with 50% of the world population at risk of developing the disease and a mortality rate of ∼0.5 million annually (<i>1</i>). The lack of an effective vaccine and the relentless ability of the <i>Plasmodium</i> parasite responsible for malaria to develop drug resistance has contributed to the continuing disease burden (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay of current treatment regimens, but decreased effectiveness, particularly in Southeast Asia, threatens our ability to control this disease. A global effort to develop new drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria is under way but not guaranteed to succeed (<i>3</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>). These efforts include a systematic attempt to target all life-cycle stages of the parasite to allow combination therapies to be developed, which are also likely to reduce the development of resistance. High-throughput screens (HTSs) designed to identify small drug-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that prevent growth of blood-stage parasites (<i>7</i>, <i>8</i>) and target-based approaches have identified new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s that are currently in preclinical development and/or various stages of human clinical trials for treatment of malaria (<i>3</i>). Missing from these efforts has been a high-throughput technology to find liver stage–specific chemotypes. On page 1129 of this issue, Antonova-Koch <i>et al.</i> (<i>9</i>) report an HTS effort that has filled this gap. They identify a substantial number of new <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al starting points with potent liver-stage antimalarial activity, promising a new capacity to feed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s through the drug development pipeline for chemoprotection.</p>

ATP as a biological hydrotrope

Restored iron transport by a small molecule promotes absorption and hemoglobinization in animals

Because other iron-transport proteins remain active, labile iron gradients build up across the corresponding protein-deficient membranes. Here we report that a small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e natural product, hinokitiol, can harness such gradients to restore iron transport into, within, and/or out of cells. The same <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> promotes gut iron absorption in DMT1-deficient rats and ferroportin-deficient mice, as well as hemoglobinization in DMT1- and mitoferrin-deficient zebrafish. These findings illuminate a general mechanistic framework for small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e–mediated site- and direction-selective restoration of iron transport. They also suggest that small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es that partially mimic the function of missing protein transporters of iron, and possibly other ions, may have potential in treating human diseases.</p>

Predicting human olfactory perception from chemical features of odor molecules
<p>It is still not possible to predict whether a given <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e will have a perceived odor or what olfactory percept it will produce. We therefore organized the crowd-sourced DREAM Olfaction Prediction Challenge. Using a large olfactory psychophysical data set, teams developed machine-learning algorithms to predict sensory attributes of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es based on their chemoinformatic features. The resulting models accurately predicted odor intensity and pleasantness and also successfully predicted 8 among 19 rated semantic descriptors (“garlic,” “fish,” “sweet,” “fruit,” “burnt,” “spices,” “flower,” and “sour”). Regularized linear models performed nearly as well as random forest–based ones, with a predictive accuracy that closely approaches a key theoretical limit. These models help to predict the perceptual qualities of virtually any <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e with high accuracy and also reverse-engineer the smell of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e.</p>

A chemical genetic roadmap to improved tomato flavor
<p>Modern commercial tomato varieties are substantially less flavorful than heirloom varieties. To understand and ultimately correct this deficiency, we quantified flavor-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>als in 398 modern, heirloom, and wild accessions. A subset of these accessions was evaluated in consumer panels, identifying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>als that made the most important contributions to flavor and consumer liking. We found that modern commercial varieties contain significantly lower amounts of many of these important flavor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>als than older varieties. Whole-genome sequencing and a genome-wide association study permitted identification of genetic loci that affect most of the target flavor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>als, including sugars, acids, and volatiles. Together, these results provide an understanding of the flavor deficiencies in modern commercial varieties and the information necessary for the recovery of good flavor through <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar breeding.</p>

Plasticity in the Neurotransmitter Repertoire
<p>In the earliest days of neuroscience, it was thought that a neuron made and released only a single <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al, known as a neurotransmitter, to send a signal across a synapse to an adjacent neuron (<i>1</i>). At the same time, it was deeply mysterious why so many signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es were used in nervous systems. Subsequently, it became clear that many, if not most, neurons (including those in mammals) make and release two or more neurotransmitters including small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es and neuropeptides (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). As the list of these potential cotransmitters and their receptors has increased, we are faced with understanding the functional relevance of this embarrassment of riches for neural circuits and behavior. Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (substances often released with small-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e neurotransmitters) can elicit a variety of different actions on their neuron targets, including directly opening ion channels or acting through signal transduction pathways to alter neuronal excitability or synaptic transmission. Thus, characterizing the mixture of cotransmitters released by a neuron is important for understanding how neuronal circuits operate. The mechanisms that change the profile of neurotransmitter release provide opportunities for plastic changes in circuit function, and consequently in organism behavior. On page 449 of this issue, Dulcis <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) report changes in the neurotransmitter profile of neurons that underlie photoperiod-triggered changes in animal behavior. The findings argue that neurotransmitter switching is a new mechanism for neuroplasticity (<i>6</i>) in adult nervous systems.</p>

Identification of Genes Encoding Enzymes Catalyzing the Early Steps of Carrot Polyacetylene Biosynthesis
<p>Polyacetylenic lipids accumulate in various Apiaceae species after pathogen attack, suggesting that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s are naturally occurring pesticides and potentially valuable resources for crop improvement. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s also promote human health and slow tumor growth. Even though polyacetylenic lipids were discovered decades ago, the biosynthetic pathway underlying their production is largely unknown. To begin filling this gap and ultimately enable polyacetylene engineering, we studied polyacetylenes and their biosynthesis in the major Apiaceae crop carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i> subsp. <i>sativus</i>). Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified three known polyacetylenes and assigned provisional structures to two novel polyacetylenes. We also quantified these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s in carrot leaf, petiole, root xylem, root phloem, and root periderm extracts. Falcarindiol and falcarinol predominated and accumulated primarily in the root periderm. Since the multiple double and triple carbon-carbon bonds that distinguish polyacetylenes from ubiquitous fatty acids are often introduced by Δ12 oleic acid desaturase (FAD2)-type enzymes, we mined the carrot genome for <i>FAD2</i> genes. We identified a <i>FAD2</i> family with an unprecedented 24 members and analyzed public, tissue-specific carrot RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed members with root periderm-enhanced expression. Six candidate genes were heterologously expressed individually and in combination in yeast and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), resulting in the identification of one canonical FAD2 that converts oleic to linoleic acid, three divergent FAD2-like acetylenases that convert linoleic into crepenynic acid, and two bifunctional FAD2s with Δ12 and Δ14 desaturase activity that convert crepenynic into the further desaturated dehydrocrepenynic acid, a polyacetylene pathway intermediate. These genes can now be used as a basis for discovering other steps of falcarin-type polyacetylene biosynthesis, to modulate polyacetylene levels in plants, and to test the in planta function of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es.</p>

A Novel Chemical Inhibitor of ABA Signaling Targets All ABA Receptors
<p>Abscisic acid (ABA), the most important stress-induced phytohormone, regulates seed dormancy, germination, plant senescence, and the abiotic stress response. ABA signaling is repressed by group A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), and then ABA binds to its receptor of the ACTIN RESISTANCE1 (PYR1), PYR1-LIKE (PYL), and REGULATORY COMPONENTS OF ABA RECEPTORS (RCAR) family, which, in turn, inhibits PP2Cs and activates downstream ABA signaling. The agonist/antagonist of ABA receptors have the potential to reveal the ABA signaling machinery and to become lead <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s for agro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>als; however, until now, no broad-spectrum antagonists of ABA receptors blocking all PYR/PYL-PP2C interactions have been identified. Here, using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al genetics screenings, we identified ABA ANTAGONIST1 (AA1), the first broad-spectrum antagonist of ABA receptors in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Physiological analyses revealed that AA1 is sufficiently active to block ABA signaling. AA1 interfered with all the PYR/PYL-HAB1 interactions, and the diminished PYR/PYL-HAB1 interactions, in turn, restored the activity of HAB1. AA1 binds to all 13 members. Molecular dockings, the non-AA1-bound PYL2 variant, and competitive binding assays demonstrated that AA1 enters into the ligand-binding pocket of PYL2. Using AA1, we tested the genetic relationships of ABA receptors with other core components of ABA signaling, demonstrating that AA1 is a powerful tool with which to sidestep this genetic redundancy of PYR/PYLs. In addition, the application of AA1 delays leaf senescence. Thus, our study developed an efficient broad-spectrum antagonist of ABA receptors and demonstrated that plant senescence can be <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>ally controlled through AA1, with a simple and easy-to-synthesize structure, allowing its availability and utility as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al probe synthesized in large quantities, indicating its potential application in agriculture.</p>

Endogenous Bioactive Jasmonate Is Composed of a Set of (+)-7-<i>iso-</i>JA-Amino Acid Conjugates<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Jasmonates (JAs) regulate a wide range of plant defense and development processes. The bioactive JA is perceived by its receptor COI1 to trigger the degradation of JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins and subsequently derepress the JAZ-repressed transcription factors for activation of expression of JA-responsive genes. So far, (+)-7-<i>iso</i>-JA-<sc>l</sc>-Ile has been the only identified endogenous bioactive JA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e.

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury biomarkers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury biomarkers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with prognosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury biomarkers were analyzed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

Non-specificity of Pitstop 2 in clathrin-mediated endocytosis
<p>Small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>e inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis are highly desired for the dissection of membrane trafficking pathways in the lab and for potential use as anti-infectives in the clinic. One inhibition strategy is to prevent clathrin from contacting adaptor proteins so that clathrin-mediated endocytosis cannot occur. “Pitstop” <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s have been developed that block only one of the four functional interaction sites on the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. Despite this limitation, Pitstop 2 causes profound inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study, we probed for non-specific activity of Pitstop 2 by examining its action in cells expressing clathrin heavy chain harbouring mutations in the N-terminal domain interaction sites. We conclude that the inhibition observed with this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong> is due to non-specificity, i.e. it causes inhibition away from its proposed mode of action. We recommend that these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s be used with caution in cells and that they should not be used to conclude anything of the function of clathrin's N-terminal domain.</p>

Second-scale nuclear spin coherence time of ultracold <sup>23</sup>Na<sup>40</sup>K molecules
<p>Coherence, the stability of the relative phase between quantum states, is central to quantum mechanics and its applications. For ultracold dipolar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es at sub-microkelvin temperatures, internal states with robust coherence are predicted to offer rich prospects for quantum many-body physics and quantum information processing. We report the observation of stable coherence between nuclear spin states of ultracold fermionic sodium-potassium (NaK) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>es in the singlet rovibrational ground state. Ramsey spectroscopy reveals coherence times on the scale of 1 second; this enables high-resolution spectroscopy of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar gas. Collisional shifts are shown to be absent down to the 100-millihertz level.

Control and local measurement of the spin chemical potential in a magnetic insulator
<p>The spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al potential characterizes the tendency of spins to diffuse. Probing this quantity could provide insight into materials such as magnetic insulators and spin liquids and aid optimization of spintronic devices. Here we introduce single-spin magnetometry as a generic platform for nonperturbative, nanoscale characterization of spin <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al potentials. We experimentally realize this platform using diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers and use it to investigate magnons in a magnetic insulator, finding that the magnon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al potential can be controlled by driving the system’s ferromagnetic resonance. We introduce a symmetry-based two-fluid theory describing the underlying magnon processes, measure the local thermomagnonic torque, and illustrate the detection sensitivity using electrically controlled spin injection. Our results pave the way for nanoscale control and imaging of spin transport in mesoscopic systems.</p>

Unequivocal determination of complex molecular structures using anisotropic NMR measurements
<p>Assignment of complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">molecul</span></strong>ar structures from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data can be prone to interpretational mistakes.

Consequently, these data constitute a reliable reporter of global structural validity. Anisotropic NMR parameters can be used to evaluate investigators’ structure proposals or structures generated by computer-assisted structure elucidation. Application of the method to several complex structure assignment problems shows promising results that signal a potential paradigm shift from conventional NMR data interpretation, which may be of particular utility for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">compound</span></strong>s not amenable to x-ray crystallography.</p>

High-performance vitrimers from commodity thermoplastics through dioxaborolane metathesis
<p>Windmills, cars, and dental restoration demand polymer materials and composites that are easy to process, assemble, and recycle while exhibiting outstanding mechanical, thermal, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al resistance. Vitrimers, which are polymer networks able to shuffle <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al bonds through exchange reactions, could address these demands if they were prepared from existing plastics and processed with fast production rates and current equipment. We report the metathesis of dioxaborolanes, which is rapid and thermally robust, and use it to prepare vitrimers from polymers as different as poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, and high-density polyethylene that, although permanently cross-linked, can be processed multiple times by means of extrusion or injection molding. They show superior <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">chemic</span></strong>al resistance and dimensional stability and can be efficiently assembled. The strategy is applicable to polymers with backbones made of carbon-carbon single bonds.</p>

Use of a Single Baseline Versus Multiyear 24-Hour Urine Collection for Estimation of Long-Term Sodium Intake and Associated Cardiovascular and Renal Risk
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>A decrease in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> intake has been shown to lower blood pressure, but data from cohort studies on the association with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are inconsistent. In these studies, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> intake was often estimated with a single baseline measurement, which may be inaccurate considering day-to-day changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> intake and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> excretion. We compared the effects of single versus repetitive follow-up 24-hour urine samples on the relation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> intake and long-term cardiorenal outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We selected adult subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>, an outpatient 24-hour urine sample between 1998 and 1999, and at least 1 collection during a 17-year follow-up. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> intake was estimated with a single baseline collection and the average of samples collected during a 1-, 5-, and 15-year follow-up. We used Cox regression analysis and the landmark approach to investigate the relation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> intake and cardiovascular (cardiovascular events or mortality) and renal (end-stage renal disease: dialysis, transplantation, and/or >60% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, or mortality) outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We included 574 subjects with 9776 twenty-four–hour urine samples. Average age was 47 years, and 46% were male. Median follow-up was 16.2 years. Average 24-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> excretion, ranging from 3.8 to 3.9 g (165–170 mmol), was equal among all methods (<i>P</i>=0.88). However, relative to a single baseline measurement, 50% of the subjects had a >0.8-g (>34-mmol) difference in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> intake with long-term estimations. As a result, 45%, 49%, and 50% of all subjects switched between tertiles of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> intake when the 1-, 5-, or 15-year average was used, respectively. Consequently, hazard ratios for cardiorenal outcome changed up to 85% with the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> intake estimations from short-term (1-year) and long-term (5-year) follow-up instead of baseline estimations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Relative to a single baseline 24-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> measurement, the use of subsequent 24-hour urine samples resulted in different estimations of an individual’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> intake, whereas population averages remained similar. This finding had significant consequences for the association between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> intake and long-term cardiovascular and renal outcomes.</p></sec>

Sources of Sodium in US Adults From 3 Geographic Regions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US adults consume excess <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong>. Knowledge about the dietary sources of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> intake is critical to the development of effective reduction strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A total of 450 adults were recruited from 3 geographic locations: Birmingham, AL (n=150); Palo Alto, CA (n=150); and the Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN (n=150), metropolitan areas. Equal numbers of women and men from each of 4 race/ethnic groups (blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites) were targeted for recruitment. Four record-assisted 24-hour dietary recalls were collected from each participant with special procedures, which included the collection of duplicate samples of salt added to food at the table and in home food preparation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> added to food outside the home was the leading source of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong>, accounting for more than two thirds (70.9%) of total <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> intake in the sample. Although the proportion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> from this source was smaller in some subgroups, it was the leading contributor for all subgroups. Contribution ranged from 66.3% for those with a high school level of education or less to 75.0% for those 18 to 29 years of age. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> inherent to food was the next highest contributor (14.2%), followed by salt added in home food preparation (5.6%) and salt added to food at the table (4.9%).

Association Between Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Blood Pressure Among Adults in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Higher levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> and lower levels of potassium intake are associated with higher blood pressure. However, the shape and magnitude of these associations can vary by study participant characteristics or intake assessment method. Twenty-four–hour urinary excretion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> and potassium are unaffected by recall errors and represent all sources of intake, and were collected for the first time in a nationally representative US survey. Our objective was to assess the associations of blood pressure and hypertension with 24-hour urinary excretion of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> and potassium among US adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Cross-sectional data were obtained from 766 participants age 20 to 69 years with complete blood pressure and 24-hour urine collections in the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the US noninstitutionalized population.

Outcomes included systolic and diastolic blood pressure from the average of 3 measures and hypertension status, based on average blood pressure ≥140/90 and antihypertensive medication use.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After multivariable adjustment, each 1000-mg difference in usual 24-hour <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> excretion was directly associated with systolic (4.58 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.64–6.51) and diastolic (2.25 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.83–3.67) blood pressures. Each 1000-mg difference in potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic blood pressure (–3.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, –6.01 to –1.42). Each 0.5 U difference in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong>-to-potassium ratio was directly associated with systolic blood pressure (1.72 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.76–2.68).

Identification of site-specific isotopic labels by vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope
<p>The identification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic labels by conventional macroscopic techniques lacks spatial resolution and requires relatively large quantities of material for measurements. We recorded the vibrational spectra of an α amino acid, <sc>l</sc>-alanine, with damage-free “aloof” electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope to directly resolve carbon-site–specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic labels in real space with nanoscale spatial resolution. An <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic red shift of 4.8 ± 0.4 milli–electron volts in C–O asymmetric stretching modes was observed for <sup>13</sup>C-labeled <sc>l</sc>-alanine at the carboxylate carbon site, which was confirmed by macroscopic infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. The accurate measurement of this shift opens the door to nondestructive, site-specific, spatially resolved identification of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ically labeled molecules with the electron microscope.</p>

The Hydrogen Isotope Composition δ<sup>2</sup>H Reflects Plant Performance
<p>The stable carbon (δ<sup>13</sup>C) and oxygen (δ<sup>18</sup>O) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e compositions in plant matter reflect photosynthetic and transpirative conditions in plants, respectively. However, the nature of hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e composition (δ<sup>2</sup>H) and what it reflects of plant performance is poorly understood. Using durum wheat (<i>Triticum turgidum</i> var <i>durum</i>), this study evaluated the effect of different water and nitrogen growing field conditions on transpiration and how this effect influenced the performance of δ<sup>2</sup>H in autotrophic (flag leaf), mixotrophic (ears), and heterotrophic (grains and roots) organs. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was compared with the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O in the same organs. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e compositions were analyzed in dry matter, the water-soluble fraction, and in water from different tissues of a set of genotypes. Similar to δ<sup>13</sup>C, the δ<sup>2</sup>H correlated negatively with stomatal conductance, whereas no correlation was observed for δ<sup>18</sup>O. Moreover, δ<sup>2</sup>H was not only affected by changes in transpiration but also by photosynthetic reactions, probably as a consequence of NADPH formation in autotrophic organs. Compared with the δ<sup>2</sup>H of stem water, plant δ<sup>2</sup>H was strongly diminished in photosynthetic organs such as the flag leaves, whereas it strongly increased in heterotrophic organs such as grains and roots. In heterotrophic organs, δ<sup>2</sup>H was associated with postphotosynthetic effects because there are several processes that lead to <sup>2</sup>H-enrichment of carbohydrates. In summary, δ<sup>2</sup>H exhibited specific features that inform about the water conditions of the wheat crop, together with the photosynthetic characteristics of the plant part considered. Moreover, correlations of δ<sup>2</sup>H with grain yield illustrate that this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e can be used to assess plant performance under different growing conditions.</p>

Quantification of drought during the collapse of the classic Maya civilization
<p>The demise of Lowland Classic Maya civilization during the Terminal Classic Period (~800 to 1000 CE) is a well-cited example of how past climate may have affected ancient societies. Attempts to estimate the magnitude of hydrologic change, however, have met with equivocal success because of the qualitative and indirect nature of available climate proxy data. We reconstructed the past <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic composition (δ<sup>18</sup>O, δD, <sup>17</sup>O-excess, and d-excess) of water in Lake Chichancanab, Mexico, using a technique that involves <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic analysis of the structurally bound water in sedimentary gypsum, which was deposited under drought conditions. The triple oxygen and hydrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e data provide a direct measure of past changes in lake hydrology. We modeled the data and conclude that annual precipitation decreased between 41 and 54% (with intervals of up to 70% rainfall reduction during peak drought conditions) and that relative humidity declined by 2 to 7% compared to present-day conditions.</p>

Remobilization of crustal carbon may dominate volcanic arc emissions
<p>The flux of carbon into and out of Earth’s surface environment has implications for Earth’s climate and habitability. We compiled a global data set for carbon and helium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>es from volcanic arcs and demonstrated that the carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e composition of mean global volcanic gas is considerably heavier, at –3.8 to –4.6 per mil (‰), than the canonical mid-ocean ridge basalt value of –6.0‰. The largest volcanic emitters outgas carbon with higher δ<sup>13</sup>C and are located in mature continental arcs that have accreted carbonate platforms, indicating that reworking of crustal limestone is an important source of volcanic carbon. The fractional burial of organic carbon is lower than traditionally determined from a global carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e mass balance and may have varied over geological time, modulated by supercontinent formation and breakup.</p>

Tungsten-182 heterogeneity in modern ocean island basalts

The tungsten <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic data negatively correlate with <sup>3</sup>He/<sup>4</sup>He. These data indicate that each OIB system accesses domains within Earth that formed within the first 60 million years of solar system history.

Isoscapes resolve species-specific spatial patterns in plant–plant interactions in an invaded Mediterranean dune ecosystem
<p>Environmental heterogeneity and plant–plant interactions are key factors shaping plant communities. However, the spatial dimension of plant–plant interactions has seldom been addressed in field studies. This is at least partially rooted in a lack of methods that can accurately resolve functional processes in a spatially explicit manner. Isoscapes, that is, spatially explicit representations of stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e data, provide a versatile means to trace functional changes on spatial scales, for example, related to N-cycling (foliar δ<sup>15</sup>N) and water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub>, foliar δ<sup>13</sup>C). In a case study in a nutrient-depleted Mediterranean dune ecosystem, we analysed the spatial impact of the invasive N<sub>2</sub>-fixing <i>Acacia longifolia</i> on three native species of different functional types using δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Isoscapes revealed strong spatial patterns in δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C with pronounced species-specific differences, demonstrating distinct spatial ranges of plant–plant interactions. A coniferous tree and an ericaceous dwarf shrub showed significant enrichment in δ<sup>15</sup>N within a range of 5–8 m surrounding the canopy of <i>A. longifolia</i>, indicating input of N originating from symbiotic N<sub>2</sub>-fixation by the invader. In the dwarf shrub, which was most responsive to invader influence, enrichment in δ<sup>13</sup>C additionally demonstrated spatially explicit changes to WUE<sub>i</sub>, while a native N<sub>2</sub>-fixer was unresponsive to the presence of the invader. Furthermore, δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C isoscapes yielded different patterns, indicating that plant–plant interactions can have distinct spatial distributions and ranges based on the process measured. Additionally, the magnitude of the effect differed between field situations with high and low invasion pressure. This study highlights that the spatial scale must be accounted for when assessing the effects and outcome of species interactions. Functional tracers such as stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>es enable us to quantify spatial ranges of plant–plant interactions, providing empirical data that can help to better understand and predict complex species interactions in multifaceted natural environments.</p>

Synergistic regulation of serotonin and opioid signaling contributes to pain insensitivity in Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 knockout mice
<p>Genetic loss of the voltage-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7<sup>−/−</sup>) results in lifelong insensitivity to pain in mice and humans. One underlying cause is an increase in the production of endogenous opioids in sensory neurons. We analyzed whether Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 deficiency altered nociceptive heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, such as initiated by GPCRs that respond to serotonin (pronociceptive) or opioids (antinociceptive), in sensory neurons. We found that the nociceptive neurons of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 knockout (Na<sub>v</sub>1.7<sup>−/−</sup>) mice, but not those of Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 knockout (Na<sub>v</sub>1.8<sup>−/−</sup>) mice, exhibited decreased pronociceptive serotonergic signaling through the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors, which are Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs that stimulate the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate resulting in protein kinase A (PKA) activity, as well as reduced abundance of the RIIβ regulatory subunit of PKA. Simultaneously, the efficacy of antinociceptive opioid signaling mediated by the Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled mu opioid receptors was increased. Consequently, opioids inhibited more efficiently tetrodotoxin-resistant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> currents, which are important for pain-initiating neuronal activity in nociceptive neurons. Thus, Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 controls the efficacy and balance of GPCR-mediated pro- and antinociceptive intracellular signaling, such that without Na<sub>v</sub>1.7, the balance is shifted toward antinociception, resulting in lifelong endogenous analgesia.</p>

Sulfur isotopes in diamonds reveal differences in continent construction
<p>Neoproterozoic West African diamonds contain sulfide inclusions with mass-independently fractionated (MIF) sulfur <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>es that trace Archean surficial signatures into the mantle. Two episodes of subduction are recorded in these West African sulfide inclusions: thickening of the continental lithosphere through horizontal processes around 3 billion years ago and reworking and diamond growth around 650 million years ago. We find that the sulfur <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e record in worldwide diamond inclusions is consistent with changes in tectonic processes that formed the continental lithosphere in the Archean. Slave craton diamonds that formed 3.5 billion years ago do not contain any MIF sulfur. Younger diamonds from the Kaapvaal, Zimbabwe, and West African cratons do contain MIF sulfur, which suggests craton construction by advective thickening of mantle lithosphere through conventional subduction-style horizontal tectonics.</p>

East Asian hydroclimate modulated by the position of the westerlies during Termination I
<p>Speleothem oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e records have revolutionized our understanding of the paleo East Asian monsoon, yet there is fundamental disagreement on what they represent in terms of the hydroclimate changes. We report a multiproxy speleothem record of monsoon evolution during the last deglaciation from the middle Yangtze region, which indicates a wetter central eastern China during North Atlantic cooling episodes, despite the oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic record suggesting a weaker monsoon. We show that this apparent contradiction can be resolved if the changes are interpreted as a lengthening of the Meiyu rains and shortened post-Meiyu stage, in accordance with a recent hypothesis. Model simulations support this interpretation and further reveal the role of the westerlies in communicating the North Atlantic influence to the East Asian climate.</p>

Postimpact earliest Paleogene warming shown by fish debris oxygen isotopes (El Kef, Tunisia)
<p>Greenhouse warming is a predicted consequence of the Chicxulub impact, but supporting data are sparse. This shortcoming compromises understanding of the impact’s effects, and it has persisted due to an absence of sections that both contain suitable material for traditional carbonate- or organic-based paleothermometry and are complete and expanded enough to resolve changes on short time scales. We address the problem by analyzing the oxygen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic composition of fish debris, phosphatic microfossils that are relatively resistant to diagenetic alteration, from the Global Stratotype Section and Point for the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary at El Kef, Tunisia.

Titanium isotopic evidence for felsic crust and plate tectonics 3.5 billion years ago
<p>Earth exhibits a dichotomy in elevation and chemical composition between the continents and ocean floor.

We measured the titanium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic composition of shales to constrain the chemical composition of the continental crust exposed to weathering and found that shales of all ages have a uniform <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic composition. This can only be explained if the emerged crust was predominantly felsic (silica-rich) since 3.5 billion years ago, requiring an early initiation of plate tectonics. We also observed a change in the abundance of biologically important nutrients phosphorus and nickel across the Archean-Proterozoic boundary, which might have helped trigger the rise in atmospheric oxygen.</p>

Linking Duplication of a Calcium Sensor to Salt Tolerance in <i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>
<p>The SALT-OVERLY-SENSITIVE (SOS) pathway in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) functions to prevent the toxic accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> in the cytosol when plants are grown in salt-affected soils. In this pathway, the CALCINEURIN B-LIKE10 (AtCBL10) calcium sensor interacts with the AtSOS2 kinase to activate the AtSOS1 plasma membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong>/proton exchanger. <i>CBL10</i> has been duplicated in Eutrema (<i>Eutrema salsugineum</i>), a salt-tolerant relative of Arabidopsis. Because Eutrema maintains growth in salt-affected soils that kill most crop plants, the duplication of <i>CBL10</i> provides a unique opportunity to functionally test the outcome of gene duplication and its link to plant salt tolerance. In Eutrema, individual down-regulation of the duplicated <i>CBL10</i> genes (<i>EsCBL10a</i> and <i>EsCBL10b</i>) decreased growth in the presence of salt and, in combination, led to an even greater decrease, suggesting that both genes function in response to salt and have distinct functions. Cross-species complementation assays demonstrated that <i>EsCBL10b</i> has an enhanced ability to activate the SOS pathway while <i>EsCBL10a</i> has a function not performed by <i>AtCBL10</i> or <i>EsCBL10b</i>. Chimeric EsCBL10a/EsCBL10b proteins revealed that the specific functions of the EsCBL10 proteins resulted from changes in the amino terminus. The duplication of <i>CBL10</i> increased calcium-mediated signaling capacity in Eutrema and conferred increased salt tolerance to salt-sensitive Arabidopsis.</p>

Estimating Mesophyll Conductance from Measurements of C<sup>18</sup>OO Photosynthetic Discrimination and Carbonic Anhydrase Activity
<p>Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in leaves catalyzes the <sup>18</sup>O exchange between CO<sub>2</sub> and water during photosynthesis. This feature has been used to estimate the mesophyll conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>g</i><sub>m</sub>) from measurements of online C<sup>18</sup>OO photosynthetic discrimination (<sup>18</sup>O). Based on CA assays on leaf extracts, it has been argued that CO<sub>2</sub> in mesophyll cells should be in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic equilibrium with water in most C<sub>3</sub> species as well as many C<sub>4</sub> dicot species. However, this seems incompatible with <sup>18</sup>O data that would indicate a much lower degree of equilibration, especially in C<sub>4</sub> plants under high light intensity. This apparent contradiction is resolved here using a new model of C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic discrimination that includes competition between CO<sub>2</sub> hydration and carboxylation and the contribution of respiratory fluxes. This new modeling framework is used to revisit previously published data sets on C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species, including CA-deficient plants. We conclude that (1) newly <sup>18</sup>O-derived <i>g</i><sub>m</sub> values are usually close but significantly higher (typically 20% and up to 50%) than those derived assuming full equilibration and (2) despite the uncertainty associated with the respiration rate in light, or the water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e gradient between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, robust estimates of <sup>18</sup>O-derived <i>g</i><sub>m</sub> can be achieved in both C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> plants.</p>

The Sites of Evaporation within Leaves
<p>The sites of evaporation within leaves are unknown, but they have drawn attention for decades due to their perceived implications for many factors, including patterns of leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic enrichment, the maintenance of mesophyll water status, stomatal regulation, and the interpretation of measured stomatal and leaf hydraulic conductances. We used a spatially explicit model of coupled water and heat transport outside the xylem, MOFLO 2.0, to map the distribution of net evaporation across leaf tissues in relation to anatomy and environmental parameters. Our results corroborate earlier predictions that most evaporation occurs from the epidermis at low light and moderate humidity but that the mesophyll contributes substantially when the leaf center is warmed by light absorption, and more so under high humidity. We also found that the bundle sheath provides a significant minority of evaporation (15% in darkness and 18% in high light), that the vertical center of amphistomatous leaves supports net condensation, and that vertical temperature gradients caused by light absorption vary over 10-fold across species, reaching 0.3°C. We show that several hypotheses that depend on the evaporating sites require revision in light of our findings, including that experimental measurements of stomatal and hydraulic conductances should be affected directly by changes in the location of the evaporating sites. We propose a new conceptual model that accounts for mixed-phase water transport outside the xylem. These conclusions have far-reaching implications for inferences in leaf hydraulics, gas exchange, water use, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e physiology.</p>

Factorial Effects of Evolocumab and Atorvastatin on Lipoprotein Metabolism
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9), such as evolocumab, lower plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations. Evolocumab is under investigation for its effects on cardiovascular outcomes in statin-treated, high-risk patients. The mechanism of action of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies on lipoprotein metabolism remains to be fully evaluated. Stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e tracer kinetics can effectively elucidate the mode of action of new lipid-regulating pharmacotherapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We conducted a 2-by-2 factorial trial of the effects of atorvastatin (80 mg daily) and subcutaneous evolocumab (420 mg every 2 weeks) for 8 weeks on the plasma kinetics of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)–apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB), intermediate-density lipoprotein–apoB, and LDL-apoB in 81 healthy, normolipidemic, nonobese men. The kinetics of apoB in these lipoproteins was studied using a stable <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e infusion of D3-leucine, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and multicompartmental modeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Atorvastatin and evolocumab independently accelerated the fractional catabolism of VLDL-apoB (<i>P</i><0.001 and <i>P</i>.032, respectively), intermediate-density lipoprotein–apoB (<i>P</i>=0.021 and <i>P</i>=.002, respectively), and LDL-apoB (<i>P</i><0.001, both interventions). Evolocumab but not atorvastatin decreased the production rate of intermediate-density lipoprotein–apoB (<i>P</i>=0.043) and LDL-apoB (<i>P</i><0.001), which contributed to the reduction in the plasma pool sizes of these lipoprotein particles. The reduction in LDL-apoB and LDL-cholesterol concentrations was significantly greater with combination versus either monotherapy (<i>P</i><0.001). Whereas evolocumab but not atorvastatin lowered the concentration of free PCSK9, atorvastatin lowered the lathosterol/campesterol ratio (a measure of cholesterol synthesis/absorption) and apoC-III concentration. Both interventions decreased plasma apoE, but neither significantly altered lipoprotein lipase and cholesteryl ester protein mass or measures of insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In healthy, normolipidemic subjects, evolocumab decreased the concentration of atherogenic lipoproteins, particularly LDL, by accelerating their catabolism. Reductions in intermediate-density lipoprotein and LDL production also contributed to the decrease in LDL particle concentration with evolocumab by a mechanism distinct from that of atorvastatin. These kinetic findings provide a metabolic basis for understanding the potential benefits of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies incremental to statins in on-going clinical end point trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

Asymmetric synthesis of batrachotoxin: Enantiomeric toxins show functional divergence against Na<sub>V</sub>
<p>The steroidal neurotoxin (−)-batrachotoxin functions as a potent agonist of voltage-gated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> ion channels (Na<sub>V</sub>s). Here we report concise asymmetric syntheses of the natural (−) and non-natural (+) antipodes of batrachotoxin, as well both enantiomers of a C-20 benzoate–modified derivative. Electrophysiological characterization of these molecules against Na<sub>V</sub> subtypes establishes the non-natural toxin enantiomer as a reversible antagonist of channel function, markedly different in activity from (−)-batrachotoxin. Protein mutagenesis experiments implicate a shared binding side for the enantiomers in the inner pore cavity of Na<sub>V</sub>. These findings motivate and enable subsequent studies aimed at revealing how small molecules that target the channel inner pore modulate Na<sub>V</sub> dynamics.</p>

Posttranslational mutagenesis: A chemical strategy for exploring protein side-chain diversity
<p>Posttranslational modification of proteins expands their structural and functional capabilities beyond those directly specified by the genetic code. However, the vast diversity of chemically plausible (including unnatural but functionally relevant) side chains is not readily accessible. We describe C (sp<sup>3</sup>)–C (sp<sup>3</sup>) bond-forming reactions on proteins under biocompatible conditions, which exploit unusual carbon free-radical chemistry, and use them to form Cβ–Cγ bonds with altered side chains. We demonstrate how these transformations enable a wide diversity of natural, unnatural, posttranslationally modified (methylated, glycosylated, phosphorylated, hydroxylated), and labeled (fluorinated, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ically labeled) side chains to be added to a common, readily accessible dehydroalanine precursor in a range of representative protein types and scaffolds. This approach, outside of the rigid constraints of the ribosome and enzymatic processing, may be modified more generally for access to diverse proteins.</p>

Impact ejecta at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary
<p>Extraterrestrial impacts have left a substantial imprint on the climate and evolutionary history of Earth. A rapid carbon cycle perturbation and global warming event about 56 million years ago at the Paleocene-Eocene (P-E) boundary (the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) was accompanied by rapid expansions of mammals and terrestrial plants and extinctions of deep-sea benthic organisms. Here, we report the discovery of silicate glass spherules in a discrete stratigraphic layer from three marine P-E boundary sections on the Atlantic margin. Distinct characteristics identify the spherules as microtektites and microkrystites, indicating that an extraterrestrial impact occurred during the carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e excursion at the P-E boundary.</p>

NMR Spectroscopy of Native and in Vitro Tissues Implicates PolyADP Ribose in Biomineralization

Direct Evidence of a Dinuclear Copper Intermediate in Cu(I)-Catalyzed Azide-Alkyne Cycloadditions

A Critical Role of Sodium Flux via the Plasma Membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Exchanger SOS1 in the Salt Tolerance of Rice
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) stands among the world's most important crop species. Rice is salt sensitive, and the undue accumulation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) in shoots has the strongest negative correlation with rice productivity under long-term salinity. The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger protein Salt Overly Sensitive 1 (SOS1) is the sole Na<sup>+</sup> efflux transporter that has been genetically characterized to date. Here, the importance of SOS1-facilitated Na<sup>+</sup> flux in the salt tolerance of rice was analyzed in a reverse-genetics approach. A <i>sos1</i> loss-of-function mutant displayed exceptional salt sensitivity that was correlated with excessive Na<sup>+</sup> intake and impaired Na<sup>+</sup> loading into the xylem, thus indicating that SOS1 controls net root Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and long-distance Na<sup>+</sup> transport to shoots. The acute Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity of <i>sos1</i> plants at low NaCl concentrations allowed analysis of the transcriptional response to sodicity stress without effects of the osmotic stress intrinsic to high-salinity treatments. In contrast with that in the wild type, <i>sos1</i> mutant roots displayed preferential down-regulation of stress-related genes in response to salt treatment, despite the greater intensity of stress experienced by the mutant. These results suggest there is impaired stress detection or an inability to mount a comprehensive response to salinity in <i>sos1</i>. In summary, the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger SOS1 plays a major role in the salt tolerance of rice by controlling Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and possibly contributing to the sensing of sodicity stress.</p>

The Coiled-Coil NLR <i>Rph1</i>, Confers Leaf Rust Resistance in Barley Cultivar Sudan
<p>Unraveling and exploiting mechanisms of disease resistance in cereal crops is currently limited by their large repeat-rich genomes and the lack of genetic recombination or cultivar (cv)-specific sequence information. We cloned the first leaf rust resistance gene <i>Rph1</i> (<i>Rph1</i>.<i>a</i>) from cultivated barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) using “MutChromSeq,” a recently developed molecular genomics tool for the rapid cloning of genes in plants. Marker-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped <i>Rph1</i> to the short arm of chromosome 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the barley cv Morex reference assembly. A <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> azide mutant population in cv Sudan was generated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H chromosomes from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were sequenced and compared to identify candidate genes for the <i>Rph1</i> locus. MutChromSeq identified a single gene candidate encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger sequencing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate gene. Phylogenetic analysis determined that <i>Rph1</i> clustered separately from all previously cloned NLRs from the Triticeae and displayed highest sequence similarity (89%) with a homolog of the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) disease resistance protein 1 protein in <i>Triticum urartu</i>. In this study we determined the molecular basis for <i>Rph1</i>-mediated resistance in cultivated barley enabling varietal improvement through diagnostic marker design, gene editing, and gene stacking technologies.</p>

Genome-Scale Fluxome of <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 Using Transient <sup>13</sup>C-Labeling Data
<p><i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973 (<i>Synechococcus</i> 2973) has the shortest reported doubling time (2.1 h) among cyanobacteria, making it a promising platform for the solar-based production of biochemicals. In this meta-analysis, its intracellular flux distribution was recomputed using genome-scale <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic nonstationary <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis given the labeling dynamics of 13 metabolites reported in an earlier study. To achieve this, a genome-scale mapping model, namely <i>i</i>mSyu593, was constructed using the <i>i</i>mSyn617 mapping model for <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>Synechocystis</i> 6803) as the starting point encompassing 593 reactions. The flux elucidation revealed nearly complete conversion (greater than 96%) of the assimilated carbon into biomass in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973. In contrast, <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 achieves complete conversion of only 86% of the assimilated carbon. This high biomass yield was enabled by the reincorporation of the fixed carbons lost in anabolic and photorespiratory pathways in conjunction with flux rerouting through a nondecarboxylating reaction such as phosphoketolase. This reincorporation of lost CO<sub>2</sub> sustains a higher flux through the photorespiratory C2 cycle that fully meets the glycine and serine demands for growth. In accordance with the high carbon efficiency drive, acetyl-coenzyme A was entirely produced using the carbon-efficient phosphoketolase pathway. Comparison of the <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973 flux map with that of <i>Synechocystis</i> 6803 revealed differences in the use of Calvin cycle and photorespiratory pathway reactions. The two species used different reactions for the synthesis of metabolites such as fructose-6-phosphate, glycine, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and Ser. These findings allude to a highly carbon-efficient metabolism alongside the fast carbon uptake rate in <i>Synechococcus</i> 2973, which explains its faster growth rate.</p>

Cation Specificity of Vacuolar NHX-Type Cation/H<sup>+</sup> Antiporters
<p>Cation/H<sup>+</sup> (NHX-type) antiporters are important regulators of intracellular ion homeostasis and are critical for cell expansion and plant stress acclimation. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), four distinct NHX isoforms, named AtNHX1 to AtNHX4, locate to the tonoplast. To determine the concerted roles of all tonoplast NHXs on vacuolar ion and pH homeostasis, we examined multiple knockout mutants lacking all but one of the four vacuolar isoforms and quadruple knockout plants lacking any vacuolar NHX activity. The <i>nhx</i> triple and quadruple knockouts displayed reduced growth phenotypes. Exposure to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> chloride improved growth while potassium chloride was deleterious to some knockouts. Kinetic analysis of K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> transport indicated that AtNHX1 and AtNHX2 are the main contributors to both vacuolar pH and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> uptake, while AtNHX3 and AtNHX4 differ in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> selectivity. The lack of any vacuolar NHX activity resulted in no K<sup>+</sup> uptake, highly acidic vacuoles, and reduced but not abolished vacuolar Na<sup>+</sup> uptake. Additional K<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange activity assays in the quadruple knockout indicated Na<sup>+</sup> uptake that was not H<sup>+</sup> coupled, suggesting the existence of an alternative, cation/H<sup>+</sup>-independent, Na<sup>+</sup> conductive pathway in vacuoles. These results highlight the importance of NHX-type cation/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters in the maintenance of cellular cation homeostasis and in growth and development.</p>

OsPHT1;3 Mediates Uptake, Translocation, and Remobilization of Phosphate under Extremely Low Phosphate Regimes
<p>Plant roots rely on inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) transporters to acquire soluble Pi from soil solutions that exists at micromolar levels in natural ecosystems. Here, we functionally characterized a rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) Pi transporter, Os Phosphate Transporter-1;3 (OsPHT1;3), that mediates Pi uptake, translocation, and remobilization. <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was directly regulated by Os Phosphate Starvation Response-2 and, in response to Pi starvation, showed enhanced expression in young leaf blades and shoot basal regions and even more so in roots and old leaf blades. OsPHT1;3 was able to complement a yeast mutant strain defective in five Pi transporters and mediate Pi influx in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes. Overexpression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to increased Pi concentration both in roots and shoots. However, unlike that reported for other known OsPHT1 members that facilitate Pi uptake at relatively higher Pi levels, mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> impaired Pi uptake and root-to-shoot Pi translocation only when external Pi concentration was below 5 μ<sc>m</sc>. Moreover, in basal nodes, the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> was restricted to the phloem of regular vascular bundles and enlarged vascular bundles. An <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e labeling experiment with <sup>32</sup>P showed that <i>ospht1</i>;<i>3</i> mutant lines were impaired in remobilization of Pi from source to sink leaves. Furthermore, overexpression and mutation of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>3</i> led to reciprocal alteration in the expression of <i>OsPHT1</i>;<i>2</i> and several other <i>OsPHT1</i> genes. Yeast-two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and coimmunoprecipitation assays all demonstrated a physical interaction between OsPHT1;3 and OsPHT1;2. Taken together, our results indicate that OsPHT1;3 acts as a crucial factor for Pi acquisition, root-to-shoot Pi translocation, and redistribution of phosphorus in plants growing in environments with extremely low Pi levels.</p>

Diurnal Variation in Nonstructural Carbohydrate Storage in Trees: Remobilization and Vertical Mixing
<p>Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) storage plays a critical role in tree function and survival, but understanding and predicting local NSC storage dynamics is challenging because NSC storage pools are dispersed throughout the complex architecture of trees and continuously exchange carbon between source and sink organs at different time scales. To address these knowledge gaps, characterization and understanding of NSC diel variation are necessary. Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (<i>Prunus dulcis</i>) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>ic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50% over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree’s structure in combination with dispersed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.</p>

Natural Variation within a Species for Traits Underpinning C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>Engineering C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis into C<sub>3</sub> crops could substantially increase their yield by alleviating photorespiratory losses. This objective is challenging because the C<sub>4</sub> pathway involves complex modifications to the biochemistry, cell biology, and anatomy of leaves. Forward genetics has provided limited insight into the mechanistic basis of these properties, and there have been no reports of significant quantitative intraspecific variation of C<sub>4</sub> attributes that would allow trait mapping. Here, we show that accessions of the C<sub>4</sub> species <i>Gynandropsis gynandra</i> collected from locations across Africa and Asia exhibit natural variation in key characteristics of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. Variable traits include bundle sheath size and vein density, gas-exchange parameters, and carbon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e discrimination associated with the C<sub>4</sub> state. The abundance of transcripts encoding core enzymes of the C<sub>4</sub> cycle also showed significant variation. Traits relating to water use showed more quantitative variation than those associated with carbon assimilation. We propose that variation in these traits likely adapted the hydraulic system for increased water use efficiency rather than improving carbon fixation, indicating that selection pressure may drive C<sub>4</sub> diversity in <i>G. gynandra</i> by modifying water use rather than photosynthesis. The accessions analyzed can be easily crossed and produce fertile offspring. Our findings, therefore, indicate that natural variation within this C<sub>4</sub> species is sufficiently large to allow genetic mapping of key C<sub>4</sub> traits and regulators.</p>

Making Epidermal Bladder Cells Bigger: Developmental- and Salinity-Induced Endopolyploidy in a Model Halophyte
<p>Endopolyploidy occurs when DNA replication takes place without subsequent mitotic nuclear division, resulting in cell-specific ploidy levels within tissues. In plants, endopolyploidy plays an important role in sustaining growth and development, but only a few studies have demonstrated a role in abiotic stress response. In this study, we investigated the function of ploidy level and nuclear and cell size in leaf expansion throughout development and tracked cell type-specific ploidy in the halophyte <i>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</i>. In addition to developmental endopolyploidy, we examined the effects of salinity stress on ploidy level. We focused specifically on epidermal bladder cells (EBC), which are modified balloon-like trichomes, due to their large size and role in salt accumulation. Our results demonstrate that ploidy increases as the leaves expand in a similar manner for each leaf type, and ploidy levels up to 512C were recorded for nuclei in EBC of leaves of adult plants. Salt treatment led to a significant increase in ploidy levels in the EBC, and these cells showed spatially related differences in their ploidy and nuclear and cell size depending on the positions on the leaf and stem surface. Transcriptome analysis highlighted salinity-induced changes in genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycle, endoreduplication, and trichome development in EBC. The increase in cell size and ploidy observed in <i>M. crystallinum</i> under salinity stress may contribute to salt tolerance by increasing the storage capacity for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> sequestration brought about by higher metabolic activity driving rapid cell enlargement in the leaf tissue and EBC.</p>

Measurement of Gross Photosynthesis, Respiration in the Light, and Mesophyll Conductance Using H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O Labeling
<p>A fundamental challenge in plant physiology is independently determining the rates of gross O<sub>2</sub> production by photosynthesis and O<sub>2</sub> consumption by respiration, photorespiration, and other processes. Previous studies on isolated chloroplasts or leaves have separately constrained net and gross O<sub>2</sub> production (NOP and GOP, respectively) by labeling ambient O<sub>2</sub> with <sup>18</sup>O while leaf water was unlabeled. Here, we describe a method to accurately measure GOP and NOP of whole detached leaves in a cuvette as a routine gas-exchange measurement. The petiole is immersed in water enriched to a δ<sup>18</sup>O of ∼9,000‰, and leaf water is labeled through the transpiration stream. Photosynthesis transfers <sup>18</sup>O from H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2</sub>. GOP is calculated from the increase in δ<sup>18</sup>O of O<sub>2</sub> as air passes through the cuvette. NOP is determined from the increase in O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>. Both terms are measured by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e ratio mass spectrometry. CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and other standard gas-exchange parameters also were measured. Reproducible measurements are made on a single leaf for more than 15 h. We used this method to measure the light response curve of NOP and GOP in French bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i>) at 21% and 2% O<sub>2</sub>. We then used these data to examine the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> ratio of net photosynthesis, the light response curve of mesophyll conductance, and the apparent inhibition of respiration in the light (Kok effect) at both oxygen levels. The results are discussed in the context of evaluating the technique as a tool to study and understand leaf physiological traits.</p>

OsHAD1, a Haloacid Dehalogenase-Like APase, Enhances Phosphate Accumulation
<p>Phosphorus (P) deficiency limits plant growth and yield. Since plants can absorb only the inorganic form of P (Pi), a large portion of soil P (organic and inorganic P complexes) remains unused. Here, we identified and characterized a PHR2-regulated, novel low-Pi-responsive haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like hydrolase, <i>OsHAD1</i>. While OsHAD1 is a functional HAD protein having both acid phosphatase and phytase activities, it showed little homology with other known low-Pi-responsive HAD superfamily members. Recombinant OsHAD1 is active at acidic pH and dephosphorylates a broad range of organic and inorganic P-containing substrates, including phosphorylated serine and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> phytate. Exogenous application of recombinant OsHAD1 protein in growth medium supplemented with phytate led to marked increases in growth and total P content of Pi-deficient wild-type rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) seedlings. Furthermore, overexpression of <i>OsHAD1</i> in rice resulted in enhanced phosphatase activity, biomass, and total and soluble P contents in Pi-deficient transgenic seedlings treated with phytate as a restricted Pi source. Gene expression and metabolite profiling revealed enhanced Pi starvation responses, such as up-regulation of multiple genes involved in Pi uptake and solubilization, accumulation of organic acids, enhanced secretory phosphatase activity, and depletion of ATP in overexpression lines as compared with the wild type. To elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms of OsHAD1, we performed in vitro pull-down assays, which revealed the association of OsHAD1 with protein kinases such as OsNDPKs. We conclude that, besides dephosphorylation of cellular organic P, OsHAD1 in coordination with kinases may regulate the phosphorylation status of downstream targets to accomplish Pi homeostasis under limited Pi supply.</p>

To further reveal its roles, we had previously produced transgenic Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RNA interference (RNAi) seeds with lower transcript expression of CYSTATHIONINE γ-SYNTHASE (<i>AtCGS</i>), Met’s main regulatory enzyme. Unexpectedly, these seeds accumulated significantly higher levels of Met compared with control seeds through an as yet unknown mechanism. Here, transcript and metabolic analyses coupled with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">isotop</span></strong>e-labeled [<sup>13</sup>C]SMM and [<sup>13</sup>C]Met feeding experiments enabled us to reveal that SMM that was synthesized in rosette leaves of RNAi plants significantly contributed to the accumulation of Met in their seeds at late stages of development. Seed-specific repression of <i>AtCGS</i> in RNAi seeds triggered the induction of genes operating in the SMM cycle of rosette leaves, leading to elevated transport of SMM toward the seeds, where higher reconversion rates of SMM to Met were detected. The metabolic rearrangements in RNAi seeds resulted in an altered sulfur-associated metabolism, such as lower amounts of Cys and glutathione, as well as a differential composition of glucosinolates. Together, the data propose a novel cross talk existing between seeds and rosette leaves along with mutual effects between the Asp family and SMM pathways operating in these tissues. They also shed light on the effects of higher Met levels on seed physiology and behavior.</p>

Identification of Putative Substrates of SEC2, a Chloroplast Inner Envelope Translocase
<p>Most chloroplast proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into chloroplasts. Many imported proteins are further targeted to the thylakoid membrane and lumen by the SEC1, TAT, or SRP/ALB3 translocases. Others are targeted to the inner chloroplast envelope membrane by undescribed translocases. Recently, a second SEC system (SEC2) consisting of SCY2, SECE2, and SECA2 was found in the chloroplast envelope. Null mutants of <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) exhibit a severe embryo-lethal phenotype. To investigate the function of the SEC2 system in plants, we used inducible RNA interference to knock down <i>SCY2</i> in Arabidopsis. Seedlings cultured with inducer were chlorotic with aberrant chloroplasts and undeveloped thylakoids, indicating an essential role for SCY2 in chloroplast biogenesis beyond embryo development. In <i>SCY2</i> down-regulated seedlings, several thylakoid membrane proteins, including SCY1, ALB3, and TATC, and inner envelope membrane proteins, including TIC40, TIC110, and FTSH12, were reduced substantially, suggesting that they may be SEC2 substrates. Additional insight was achieved by the in vitro reconstitution of protein integration into chloroplast membranes. The results show that SCY1 and ALB3 target directly to the thylakoid membrane and are likely independent of SEC2. FTSH12 was integrated into the envelope membrane in a coupled import-integration reaction that was impaired by the SECA inhibitor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> azide. The stromal intermediate of TIC40 integrated into the envelope in a reaction that was largely inhibited when antibodies against epitope-tagged SCY2 or SECE2 were applied. These data demonstrate that the SEC2 translocase likely integrates a subset of inner envelope membrane proteins, such as FTSH12 and TIC40.</p>

Endocrine regulation of carbonate precipitate formation in marine fish intestine by stanniocalcin and PTHrP
<p>In marine fish, high epithelial bicarbonate secretion by the intestine generates luminal carbonate precipitates of divalent cations that play a key role in water and ion homeostasis. <i>In vitro</i> studies highlight the involvement of the calciotropic hormones PTHrP (parathyroid hormone-related protein) and stanniocalcin (STC) in the regulation of epithelial bicarbonate transport. The present study tested the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i>. Sea bream (<i>Sparus aurata</i>) juveniles received single intraperitoneal injections of piscine PTHrP(1–34), the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) or purified sea bream STC, or were passively immunized with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against sea bream STC (STC-Ab). Endocrine effects on the expression of the basolateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> bicarbonate co-transporter (Slc4a4.A), the apical anion exchangers Slc26a6.A and Slc26a3.B, and the V-type proton pump β-subunit (Atp6v1b) in the anterior intestine were evaluated. In keeping with their calciotropic nature, the hypocalcaemic factors PTHrP(7–34) and STC up-regulated gene expression of all transporters. In contrast, the hypercalcaemic factor PTHrP(1–34) and STC antibodies down-regulated transporters involved in the bicarbonate secretion cascade. Changes in intestine luminal precipitate contents provoked by calcaemic endocrine factors validated these results: 24 h post-injection either PTHrP(1–34) or immunization with STC-Ab reduced the carbonate precipitate content in the sea bream intestine. In contrast, the PTH/PTHrP receptor antagonist PTHrP(7–34) increased not only the precipitated fraction but also the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> equivalents in the intestinal fluid. These results confirm the hypothesis that calciotropic hormones have a regulatory role in carbonate precipitate formation <i>in vivo</i> in the intestine of marine fish. Furthermore, they illustrate for the first time in fish the counteracting effect of PTHrP and STC, and reveal an unexpected contribution of calcaemic factors to acid–base balance.</p>

A new potassium ion current induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors in fish atrial myocytes
<p>A novel potassium ion current induced by muscarinic stimulation (<i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>) is characterized in atrial cardiomyocytes of teleost fishes (crucian carp, <i>Carassius carassius</i>; rainbow trout, <i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) by means of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The current is elicited in atrial, but not ventricular, cells by application of carbamylcholine (CCh) in moderate to high concentrations (10<sup>−7</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>). It can be distinguished from the classic <i>I</i><sub>KACh</sub>, activated by the βγ-subunit of the G<sub>i</sub>-protein, because of its low sensitivity to Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions and distinct current–voltage relationship with a very small inward current component. Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions (5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>) and KB-R7943 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), non-selective blockers of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong>–calcium exchange current (<i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>), strongly reduced and completely abolished, respectively, the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. Therefore, <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> was initially regarded as a CCh-induced outward component of the <i>I</i><sub>NCX</sub>. However, the current is not affected by either exclusion of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> or extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but is completely abolished by intracellular perfusion with K<sup>+</sup>-free solution. Atropine (10<sup>−6</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), a non-selective muscarinic blocker, completely eliminated the <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>. A selective antagonist of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoreceptors, AF-DX 116 (2×10<sup>−7</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>) and an M<sub>3</sub> antagonist, 4-DAMP (10<sup>−9</sup> mol l<sup>−1</sup>), decreased <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub> by 84.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Pertussis toxin, which irreversibly inhibits G<sub>i</sub>-protein coupled to M<sub>2</sub> receptors, reduced the current by 95%, when applied into the pipette solution. It is concluded that <i>I</i><sub>KACh2</sub>, induced by stimulation of M<sub>2</sub> cholinoceptors and subsequent G<sub>i</sub>-protein activation, represents a new molecular target for the cardiac parasympathetic innervation.</p>

An entirely automated method to score DSS-induced colitis in mice by digital image analysis of pathology slides
<p>The DSS (dextran sulfate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong>) model of colitis is a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Microscopic symptoms include loss of crypt cells from the gut lining and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the colon. An experienced pathologist requires several hours per study to score histological changes in selected regions of the mouse gut. In order to increase the efficiency of scoring, Definiens Developer software was used to devise an entirely automated method to quantify histological changes in the whole H&E slide. When the algorithm was applied to slides from historical drug-discovery studies, automated scores classified 88% of drug candidates in the same way as pathologists’ scores. In addition, another automated image analysis method was developed to quantify colon-infiltrating macrophages, neutrophils, B cells and T cells in immunohistochemical stains of serial sections of the H&E slides. The timing of neutrophil and macrophage infiltration had the highest correlation to pathological changes, whereas T and B cell infiltration occurred later. Thus, automated image analysis enables quantitative comparisons between tissue morphology changes and cell-infiltration dynamics.</p>

Transmembrane voltage potential is an essential cellular parameter for the detection and control of tumor development in a <i>Xenopus</i> model
<p>Understanding mechanisms that orchestrate cell behavior into appropriately patterned tissues and organs within the organism is an essential element of preventing, detecting and treating cancer. Bioelectric signals (resting transmembrane voltage potential gradients in all cells) underlie an important and broadly conserved set of control mechanisms that regulate pattern formation. We tested the role of transmembrane potential in tumorigenesis mediated by canonical oncogenes in <i>Xenopus laevis</i>. Depolarized membrane potential (<i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>) was a characteristic of induced tumor-like structures (ITLSs) generated by overexpression of <i>Gli1</i>, <i>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></i>, <i>Xrel3</i> or <i>p53<sup>Trp248</sup></i>. This bioelectric signature was also present in precursor ITLS sites. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a bioelectric marker that reveals ITLSs before they become histologically and morphologically apparent. Moreover, voltage was functionally important: overexpression of hyperpolarizing ion transporters caused a return to normal <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> and significantly reduced ITLS formation <i>in vivo</i>. To characterize the molecular mechanism by which <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> change regulates ITLS phenotypes, we performed a suppression screen. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> hyperpolarization was transduced into downstream events via <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub>-regulated activity of SLC5A8, a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong>-butyrate exchanger previously implicated in human cancer. These data indicate that butyrate, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, might be responsible for transcriptional events that mediate suppression of ITLSs by hyperpolarization. <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> is a convenient cellular parameter by which tumors induced by human oncogenes can be detected <i>in vivo</i> and represents a new diagnostic modality. Moreover, control of resting membrane potential is functionally involved in the process by which oncogene-bearing cells depart from normal morphogenesis programs to form tumors. Modulation of <i>V</i><sub>mem</sub> levels is a novel and promising strategy for tumor normalization.</p>

Genetic Predisposition to High Blood Pressure and Lifestyle Factors
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>High blood pressure (BP) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Both heritable and lifestyle risk factors contribute to elevated BP levels. We aimed to investigate the extent to which lifestyle factors could offset the effect of an adverse BP genetic profile and its effect on CVD risk.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We constructed a genetic risk score for high BP by using 314 published BP loci in 277 005 individuals without previous CVD from the UK Biobank study, a prospective cohort of individuals aged 40 to 69 years, with a median of 6.11 years of follow-up. We scored participants according to their lifestyle factors including body mass index, healthy diet, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol consumption, smoking, and urinary <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sodium</span></strong> excretion levels measured at recruitment. We examined the association between tertiles of genetic risk and tertiles of lifestyle score with BP levels and incident CVD by using linear regression and Cox regression models, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Healthy lifestyle score was strongly associated with BP (<i>P</i><10<sup>–320</sup>) for systolic and diastolic BP and CVD events regardless of the underlying BP genetic risk. Participants with a favorable in comparison with an unfavorable lifestyle (bottom versus top tertile lifestyle score) had 3.6, 3.5, and 3.6 mm Hg lower systolic BP in low, middle, and high genetic risk groups, respectively (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.0006). Similarly, favorable in comparison with unfavorable lifestyle showed 30%, 31%, and 33% lower risk of CVD among participants in low, middle, and high genetic risk groups, respectively (<i>P</i> for interaction=0.99).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our data further support population-wide efforts to lower BP in the population via lifestyle modification.

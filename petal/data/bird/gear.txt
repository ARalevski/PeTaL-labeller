Vaccine trial launched to stop Ebola
<p>On 8 May, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) announced that a new Ebola outbreak was underway in a remote part of the country, and within 3 days, the government decided for the first time to use an experimental vaccine to help stop spread. The vaccine performed well in a large clinical trial held in Guinea in 2015, but it remains unlicensed and technically can only be used as part of a new study. The DRC hopes the vaccine will add to traditional containment efforts like quarantine for the infected and protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gear</span></strong> for medical teams and prevent the outbreak from exploding into a full-blown epidemic, as happened in West Africa in 2014. As <i>Science</i> went to press, the DRC had two confirmed and 39 probable and suspected cases in three different health districts. Most concerning, two of the probable cases are in Mbandaka, a city that has 1.2 million residents. In addition to helping the DRC launch the vaccine trial, the international community has responded in full force, quickly sending in teams of experts to help with surveillance, testing, and treatment for the infected.</p>

Nigeria hit by unprecedented Lassa fever outbreak
<p>In the first 2 months of this year, Nigeria has had more confirmed cases of Lassa fever, a hemorrhagic disease that kills 20% to 30% of those it sickens, than in any previous year. As of 11 March, the toll from this rodent-borne virus stood at 365 confirmed cases, 16 of those among vulnerable health care workers, and 114 deaths. And those figures are widely considered an underestimate. As the government and its international partners scramble to set up isolation wards and deliver protective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gear</span></strong> to health workers, researchers on three continents are racing to figure out what is driving the unprecedented outbreak and what it portends for the future. Is it simply better disease surveillance in the wake of Ebola, the similar but more deadly disease that began its rampage across West Africa in 2014? Has the virus changed in some way? Are there more of the rats that carry it, or are more rats infected with it? Or is another rat capable of spreading the virus as well? Considering how lethal Lassa fever is, shockingly little is known about it, experts say.</p>

Locked synchronous rotor motion in a molecular motor
<p>Biological molecular motors translate their local directional motion into ordered movement of other parts of the system to empower controlled mechanical functions. The design of analogous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">gear</span></strong>ed systems that couple motion in a directional manner, which is pivotal for molecular machinery operating at the nanoscale, remains highly challenging. Here, we report a molecular rotary motor that translates light-driven unidirectional rotary motion to controlled movement of a connected biaryl rotor. Achieving coupled motion of the distinct parts of this multicomponent mechanical system required precise control of multiple kinetic barriers for isomerization and synchronous motion, resulting in sliding and rotation during a full rotary cycle, with the motor always facing the same face of the rotor.</p>

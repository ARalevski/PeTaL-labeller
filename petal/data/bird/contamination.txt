The South Asian monsoon—pollution pump and purifier
<p>Air <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion is growing fastest in monsoon-affected South Asia. During the dry winter monsoon, the fumes disperse toward the Indian Ocean, creating a vast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion haze, but their fate during the wet summer monsoon has been unclear. We performed atmospheric chemistry measurements by aircraft in the Oxidation Mechanism Observations campaign, sampling the summer monsoon outflow in the upper troposphere between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The measurements, supported by model calculations, show that the monsoon sustains a remarkably efficient cleansing mechanism by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ants are rapidly oxidized and deposited to Earth’s surface. However, some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ants are lofted above the monsoon clouds and chemically processed in a reactive reservoir before being redistributed globally, including to the stratosphere.</p>

Sexual competition affects biomass partitioning, carbon–nutrient balance, Cd allocation and ultrastructure of <i>Populus cathayana</i> females and males exposed to Cd stress
<p>Although increasing attention has been paid to plant adaptation to soil heavy metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ation, competition and neighbor effects have been largely overlooked, especially in dioecious plants. In this study, we investigated growth as well as biochemical and ultrastructural responses of <i>Populus cathayana</i> Rehder females and males to cadmium (Cd) stress under different sexual competition patterns. The results showed that competition significantly affects biomass partitioning, photosynthetic capacity, leaf and root ultrastructure, Cd accumulation, the contents of polyphenols, and structural and nonstructural carbohydrates. Compared with single-sex cultivation, plants of opposite sexes exposed to sexual competition accumulated more Cd in tissues and their growth was more strongly inhibited, indicating enhanced Cd toxicity under sexual competition. Under intrasexual competition, females showed greater Cd accumulation, more serious damage at the ultrastructural level and greater reduction in physiological activity than under intersexual competition, while males performed better under intrasexual competition than under intersexual competition. Males improved the female microenvironment by greater Cd uptake and lower resource consumption under intersexual competition. These results demonstrate that the sex of neighbor plants and competition affect sexual differences in growth and in key physiological processes under Cd stress. The asymmetry of sexual competition highlighted here might regulate population structure, and spatial segregation and phytoremediation potential of both sexes in <i>P. cathayana</i> growing in heavy metal-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ated soils.</p>

Adaptive introgression enables evolutionary rescue from extreme environmental pollution
<p>Radical environmental change that provokes population decline can impose constraints on the sources of genetic variation that may enable evolutionary rescue. Adaptive toxicant resistance has rapidly evolved in Gulf killifish (<i>Fundulus grandis</i>) that occupy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ed habitats. We show that resistance scales with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion level and negatively correlates with inducibility of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling. Loci with the strongest signatures of recent selection harbor genes regulating AHR signaling. Two of these loci introgressed recently (18 to 34 generations ago) from Atlantic killifish (<i>F. heteroclitus</i>). One introgressed locus contains a deletion in <i>AHR</i> that confers a large adaptive advantage [selection coefficient (<i>s</i>) = 0.8]. Given the limited migration of killifish, recent adaptive introgression was likely mediated by human-assisted transport. We suggest that interspecies connectivity may be an important source of adaptive variation during extreme environmental change.</p>

Factoring stream turbulence into global assessments of nitrogen pollution
<p>The discharge of excess nitrogen to streams and rivers poses an existential threat to both humans and ecosystems. A seminal study of headwater streams across the United States concluded that in-stream removal of nitrate is controlled primarily by stream chemistry and biology. Reanalysis of these data reveals that stream turbulence (in particular, turbulent mass transfer across the concentration boundary layer) imposes a previously unrecognized upper limit on the rate at which nitrate is removed from streams. The upper limit closely approximates measured nitrate removal rates in streams with low concentrations of this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ant, a discovery that should inform stream restoration designs and efforts to assess the effects of nitrogen <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion on receiving water quality and the global nitrogen cycle.</p>

Estimating the health benefits of environmental regulations
<p>Assessing health benefits of policies addressing environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ants is important for decision-making and for informing the public about how policy affects their welfare (<i>1</i>). Benefits analysis, one side of benefit-cost analysis (BCA), can be relatively straightforward when sufficient data are available on dose-response relationships, changes in exposure expected from a proposed policy, and other key inputs. But despite progress, benefits analysis for health effects is needlessly constrained by analytic practices that are scientifically outdated and inconsistent with economic theory. These limitations can result in exclusion of important health effects from the estimated benefits of reducing exposure to toxic environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ants, which, in turn, affects net benefits calculations that inform public policy. Fortunately, economic theory and scientific advances in the risk assessment literature provide a way forward.</p>

Is computer navigation when used in the surgery of iliosacral pelvic bone tumours safer for the patient?
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Due to the complex anatomy of the pelvis, limb-sparing resections   of pelvic tumours achieving adequate surgical margins, can often   be difficult. The advent of computer navigation has improved the   precision of resection of these lesions, though there is little   evidence comparing resection with or without the assistance of navigation.</p><p>Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of navigation-assisted surgery   for the resection of pelvic bone tumours involving the posterior   ilium and sacrum. </p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Using our prospectively updated institutional database, we conducted   a retrospective case control study of 21 patients who underwent   resection of the posterior ilium and sacrum, for the treatment of   a primary sarcoma of bone, between 1987 and 2015. The resection   was performed with the assistance of navigation in nine patients   and without navigation in 12. We assessed the accuracy of navigation-assisted   surgery, as defined by the surgical margin and how this affects   the rate of local recurrence, the disease-free survival and the   effects on peri-and post-operative morbidity. </p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The mean age of the patients was 36.4 years (15 to 66). The mean   size of the tumour was 10.9 cm. In the navigation-assisted group,   the margin was wide in two patients (16.7%), marginal in six (66.7%)   and wide-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ated in one (11.1%) with no intralesional margin.

Organic synthesis in a modular robotic system driven by a chemical programming language
<p>The synthesis of complex organic compounds is largely a manual process that is often incompletely documented. To address these shortcomings, we developed an abstraction that maps commonly reported methodological instructions into discrete steps amenable to automation. These unit operations were implemented in a modular robotic platform by using a chemical programming language that formalizes and controls the assembly of the molecules. We validated the concept by directing the automated system to synthesize three pharmaceutical compounds, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, rufinamide, and sildenafil, without any human intervention. Yields and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">puriti</span></strong>es of products and intermediates were comparable to or better than those achieved manually. The syntheses are captured as digital code that can be published, versioned, and transferred flexibly between platforms with no modification, thereby greatly enhancing reproducibility and reliable access to complex molecules.</p>

Peanut allergen–specific antibodies go public
<p>Changes in the human environment and activities over the past few decades have caused an epidemic of food allergies (<i>1</i>). People suffering from allergies often feel that they live on a cliff edge, as the allergens to which they react are potentially fatal (<i>2</i>). For example, tiny amounts of peanut picked up on skin or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ating other foods can be dangerous to peanut-sensitized individuals (<i>2</i>–<i>4</i>). Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies mediate the allergic response. They bind to specific receptors on inflammatory immune cells: mast cells in mucosal tissues lining body surfaces and cavities, and basophils in the circulation. These cells mediate allergic responses triggered by specific antigens (allergens) that are recognized by IgE. B cells expressing IgG antibodies have long served as the paradigm for the development of B cells into antibody-secreting plasma cells in the immune response. Until recently, the far less abundant IgE-expressing B cells have proved to be elusive. On page 1306 of this issue, Croote <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) have analyzed single B cells from six individuals with peanut allergy, which enabled the identification of the natural Ig heavy- and light-chain pairs from IgE-expressing B cells that are responsible for peanut allergy. With this information they produced recombinant antibodies, identified the peanut allergen–specific antibodies, and used site-directed mutagenesis to suppress their activity. The mutated antibodies could be used to treat peanut allergy.</p>

Predicting global killer whale population collapse from PCB pollution
<p>Killer whales (<i>Orcinus orca</i>) are among the most highly polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ated mammals in the world, raising concern about the health consequences of current PCB exposures. Using an individual-based model framework and globally available data on PCB concentrations in killer whale tissues, we show that PCB-mediated effects on reproduction and immune function threaten the long-term viability of >50% of the world’s killer whale populations. PCB-mediated effects over the coming 100 years predicted that killer whale populations near industrialized regions, and those feeding at high trophic levels regardless of location, are at high risk of population collapse. Despite a near-global ban of PCBs more than 30 years ago, the world’s killer whales illustrate the troubling persistence of this chemical class.</p>

Diatom ooze—A large marine mercury sink
<p>The role of algae for sequestration of atmospheric mercury in the ocean is largely unknown owing to a lack of marine sediment data. We used high-resolution cores from marine Antarctica to estimate Holocene global mercury accumulation in biogenic siliceous sediments (diatom ooze). Diatom ooze exhibits the highest mercury accumulation rates ever reported for the marine environment and provides a large sink of anthropogenic mercury, surpassing existing model estimates by as much as a factor of 7. Anthropogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion of the Southern Ocean began ~150 years ago, and up to 20% of anthropogenic mercury emitted to the atmosphere may have been stored in diatom ooze. These findings reveal the crucial role of diatoms as a fast vector for mercury sequestration and diatom ooze as a large marine mercury sink.</p>

‘Frightening’ typhoid fever outbreak spreads in Pakistan
<p>A strain of the bacterium that causes typhoid fever has become resistant to most every drug and is spreading through Pakistan, causing at least 2000 confirmed cases. The so-called extensively drug resistant (XDR) strain of <i>Salmonella typhi</i> remains susceptible to one oral antibiotic, azithromycin, but the only other options are expensive intravenous drugs that most people in Pakistan and other resource-strapped countries cannot afford. The fear is that if <i>S. typhi</i> develops resistance to azithromycin, many people will die from the disease, which leads to bowl perforation and other life-threatening complications in about 15% of untreated people. A new vaccine that for the first time works in young children and has long-lasting immunity is now being rolled out in Pakistan. But antibiotic resistance and spread are a result of poor sanitation and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ated water supplies, which reflect the serious infrastructure problems in Hyderabad and Karachi, the two main cities affected by XDR <i>S. typhi. </i>Public health officials worry that the XDR <i>S. typhi</i> will also jump borders and soon start spreading outside of Pakistan.</p>

Phosphoric acid as a precursor to chemicals traditionally synthesized from white phosphorus
<p>White phosphorus, generated in the legacy thermal process for phosphate rock upgrading, has long been the key industrial intermediate for the synthesis of phosphorus-containing chemicals, including herbicides, flame-retardants, catalyst ligands, battery electrolytes, pharmaceuticals, and detergents. In contrast, phosphate fertilizers are made on a much larger scale from phosphoric acid, obtained by treating phosphate rock with sulfuric acid. Dehydration of phosphoric acid using sodium chloride gives trimetaphosphate, and here we report that trichlorosilane, primarily used for the production of high-purity silicon, reduces trimetaphosphate to the previously unknown bis(trichlorosilyl)phosphide anion. This anion offers an entry point to value-added organophosphorus chemicals such as primary and secondary alkyl phosphines, and thus to organophosphinates, and can also be used to prepare phosphine gas and the hexafluorophosphate anion, all previously available only downstream from white phosphorus.</p>

Preventing mussel adhesion using lubricant-infused materials
<p>Mussels are opportunistic macro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foul</span></strong>ing organisms that can attach to most immersed solid surfaces, leading to serious economic and ecological consequences for the maritime and aquaculture industries. We demonstrate that lubricant-infused coatings exhibit very low preferential mussel attachment and ultralow adhesive strengths under both controlled laboratory conditions and in marine field studies. Detailed investigations across multiple length scales—from the molecular-scale characterization of deposited adhesive proteins to nanoscale contact mechanics to macroscale live observations—suggest that lubricant infusion considerably reduces <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">foul</span></strong>ing by deceiving the mechanosensing ability of mussels, deterring secretion of adhesive threads, and decreasing the molecular work of adhesion.

Carbon nanotube transistors scaled to a 40-nanometer footprint
<p>The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors challenges the device research community to reduce the transistor footprint containing all components to 40 nanometers within the next decade. We report on a p-channel transistor scaled to such an extremely small dimension. Built on one semiconducting carbon nanotube, it occupies less than half the space of leading silicon technologies, while delivering a significantly higher pitch-normalized current density—above 0.9 milliampere per micrometer at a low supply voltage of 0.5 volts with a subthreshold swing of 85 millivolts per decade. Furthermore, we show transistors with the same small footprint built on actual high-density arrays of such nanotubes that deliver higher current than that of the best-competing silicon devices under the same overdrive, without any normalization. We achieve this using low-resistance end-bonded contacts, a high-purity semiconducting carbon nanotube source, and self-assembly to pack nanotubes into full surface-coverage aligned arrays.</p>

Rapid cooling and cold storage in a silicic magma reservoir recorded in individual crystals
<p>Silicic volcanic eruptions pose considerable hazards, yet the processes leading to these eruptions remain poorly known. A missing link is knowledge of the thermal history of magma feeding such eruptions, which largely controls crystallinity and therefore eruptability. We have determined the thermal history of individual zircon crystals from an eruption of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. Results show that although zircons resided in the magmatic system for 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> years, they experienced temperatures >650° to 750°C for only years to centuries. This implies near-solidus long-term crystal storage, punctuated by rapid heating and cooling. Reconciling these data with existing models of magma storage requires considering multiple small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intrus</span></strong>ions and multiple spatial scales, and our approach can help to quantify heat input to and output from magma reservoirs.</p>

21st-century rise in anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on a remote coral reef
<p>With the rapid rise in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion-associated nitrogen inputs to the western Pacific, it has been suggested that even the open ocean has been affected. In a coral core from Dongsha Atoll, a remote coral reef ecosystem, we observe a decline in the <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>14</sup>N of coral skeleton–bound organic matter, which signals increased deposition of anthropogenic atmospheric N on the open ocean and its incorporation into plankton and, in turn, the atoll corals. The first clear change occurred just before 2000 CE, decades later than predicted by other work. The amplitude of change suggests that, by 2010, anthropogenic atmospheric N deposition represented 20 ± 5% of the annual N input to the surface ocean in this region, which appears to be at the lower end of other estimates.</p>

HAT-P-26b: A Neptune-mass exoplanet with a well-constrained heavy element abundance
<p>A correlation between giant-planet mass and atmospheric heavy elemental abundance was first noted in the past century from observations of planets in our own Solar System and has served as a cornerstone of planet-formation theory. Using data from the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescopes from 0.5 to 5 micrometers, we conducted a detailed atmospheric study of the transiting Neptune-mass exoplanet HAT-P-26b. We detected prominent H<sub>2</sub>O absorption bands with a maximum base-to-peak amplitude of 525 parts per million in the transmission spectrum. Using the water abundance as a proxy for metallicity, we measured HAT-P-26b’s atmospheric heavy element content ([Formula] times solar). This likely indicates that HAT-P-26b’s atmosphere is primordial and obtained its gaseous envelope late in its disk lifetime, with little <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ation from metal-rich planetesimals.</p>

Noise pollution is pervasive in U.S. protected areas
<p>Anthropogenic noise threatens ecological systems, including the cultural and biodiversity resources in protected areas.

Elevated noise was also found in critical habitats of endangered species, with 14% experiencing a 10-fold increase in sound levels. However, protected areas with more stringent regulations had less anthropogenic noise.

Seagrass ecosystems reduce exposure to bacterial pathogens of humans, fishes, and invertebrates
<p>Plants are important in urban environments for removing pathogens and improving water quality. Seagrass meadows are the most widespread coastal ecosystem on the planet. Although these plants are known to be associated with natural biocide production, they have not been evaluated for their ability to remove microbiological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ation. Using amplicon sequencing of the 16<i>S</i> ribosomal RNA gene, we found that when seagrass meadows are present, there was a 50% reduction in the relative abundance of potential bacterial pathogens capable of causing disease in humans and marine organisms. Moreover, field surveys of more than 8000 reef-building corals located adjacent to seagrass meadows showed twofold reductions in disease levels compared to corals at paired sites without adjacent seagrass meadows. These results highlight the importance of seagrass ecosystems to the health of humans and other organisms.</p>

Strong peak in <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> of Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> under uniaxial pressure
<p>Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> is an unconventional superconductor that has attracted widespread study because of its high purity and the possibility that its superconducting order parameter has odd parity. We study the dependence of its superconductivity on anisotropic strain. Applying uniaxial pressures of up to ~1 gigapascals along a 〈100〉 direction (<i>a</i> axis) of the crystal lattice results in the transition temperature (<i>T</i><sub>c</sub>) increasing from 1.5 kelvin in the unstrained material to 3.4 kelvin at compression by ≈0.6%, and then falling steeply. Calculations give evidence that the observed maximum <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> occurs at or near a Lifshitz transition when the Fermi level passes through a Van Hove singularity, and open the possibility that the highly strained, <i>T</i><sub>c</sub> = 3.4 K Sr<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> has an even-parity, rather than an odd-parity, order parameter.</p>

The genomic landscape of rapid repeated evolutionary adaptation to toxic pollution in wild fish
<p>Atlantic killifish populations have rapidly adapted to normally lethal levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion in four urban estuaries. Through analysis of 384 whole killifish genome sequences and comparative transcriptomics in four pairs of sensitive and tolerant populations, we identify the aryl hydrocarbon receptor–based signaling pathway as a shared target of selection. This suggests evolutionary constraint on adaptive solutions to complex toxicant mixtures at each site. However, distinct molecular variants apparently contribute to adaptive pathway modification among tolerant populations. Selection also targets other toxicity-mediating genes and genes of connected signaling pathways; this indicates complex tolerance phenotypes and potentially compensatory adaptations. Molecular changes are consistent with selection on standing genetic variation. In killifish, high nucleotide diversity has likely been a crucial substrate for selective sweeps to propel rapid adaptation.</p>

A bioinspired iron catalyst for nitrate and perchlorate reduction
<p>Nitrate and perchlorate have considerable use in technology, synthetic materials, and agriculture; as a result, they have become pervasive water <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ants. Industrial strategies to chemically reduce these oxyanions often require the use of harsh conditions, but microorganisms can efficiently reduce them enzymatically. We developed an iron catalyst inspired by the active sites of nitrate reductase and (per)chlorate reductase enzymes. The catalyst features a secondary coordination sphere that aids in oxyanion deoxygenation. Upon reduction of the oxyanions, an iron(III)-oxo is formed, which in the presence of protons and electrons regenerates the catalyst and releases water.</p>

Direct Proteomic Quantification of the Secretome of Activated Immune Cells
<sec><title>Tracking Secreted Proteins</title><p>The proteins secreted by cells provide a flow of information within tissues and are thus of particular interest. However, systematic detection of secreted proteins is tricky because they tend to be present in small amounts within complex mixtures of proteins where other components are very abundant. <bold>Meissner <i>et al.</i></bold> (p. 475) developed a method for screening the secreted proteins from cultured mouse macrophages in response to cues that cause inflammation. The amount of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ating proteins was reduced by culturing the cells without added serum and then sensitive mass spectrometry techniques were used to detect and quantify secretion of nearly 800 different proteins. Secretion was compared from cells lacking the signaling adaptor proteins MyD88 or TRIF, or both. Secretion of some proteins were regulated redundantly and were secreted without one of the adaptors, but others required both signals for release. Some anti-inflammatory proteins were released at later times in response to synergistic signals from both adaptor proteins, perhaps as a fail-safe mechanism to prevent excessive inflammation.</p></sec>

Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carriers Prevent Cadmium Toxicity by Sustaining the TCA Cycle and Glutathione Synthesis
<p>Cadmium (Cd) is a major heavy metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ant, and Cd toxicity is a serious cause of abiotic stress in the environment. Plants protect themselves against Cd stress through a variety of pathways. In a recent study, we found that mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (MPCs) are involved in Cd tolerance in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). Following the identification of MPCs in yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) in 2012, most studies have focused on the function of MPCs in animals, as a possible approach to reduce the risk of cancer developing. The results of this study show that AtMPC protein complexes are required for Cd tolerance and prevention of Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis. AtMPC complexes are composed of two elements, AtMPC1 and AtMPC2 (AtNRGA1 or AtMPC3). When the formation of AtMPCs was interrupted by the loss of <i>AtMPC1</i>, glutamate could supplement the synthesis of acetyl-coenzyme A and sustain the TCA cycle. With the up-regulation of glutathione synthesis following exposure to Cd stress, the supplementary pathway could not efficiently drive the tricarboxylic acid cycle without AtMPC. The ATP content decreased concomitantly with the deletion of tricarboxylic acid activity, which led to Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis. More importantly, ScMPCs were also required for Cd tolerance in yeast. Our results suggest that the mechanism of Cd tolerance may be similar in other species.</p>

Screening for Biologically Annotated Drugs That Trigger Triacylglycerol Accumulation in the Diatom <i>Phaeodactylum</i>
<p>Microalgae are a promising feedstock for the production of triacylglycerol (TAG) for a variety of potential applications, ranging from food and human health to biofuels and green chemistry. However, obtaining high TAG yields is challenging. A phenotypic assay for the accumulation of oil droplets was developed to screen a library of 1,200 drugs, annotated with pharmacology information, to select compounds that trigger TAG accumulation in the diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. Using this screen, we identified 34 molecules acting in a dose-dependent manner. Previously characterized targets of these compounds include cell division and cell signaling effectors, membrane receptors and transporters, and sterol metabolism. Among the five compounds possibly acting on sterol metabolism, we focused our study on ethynylestradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen that is used in contraceptive pills and known for its ecological impact as an endocrine disruptor. Ethynylestradiol impaired the production of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, destabilized the galactolipid versus phospholipid balance, and triggered the recycling of fatty acids from membrane lipids to TAG. The <i>P. tricornutum</i> transcriptomic response to treatment with ethynylestradiol was consistent with the reallocation of carbon from sterols to acetyl-coenzyme A and TAG. The mode of action and catabolism of ethynylestradiol are unknown but might involve several up-regulated cytochrome P450 proteins. A fatty acid elongase, Δ6-ELO-B1, might be involved in the impairment of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid turnover. This phenotypic screen opens new perspectives for the exploration of novel bioactive molecules, potential target genes, and pathways controlling TAG biosynthesis. It also unraveled the sensitivity of diatoms to endocrine disruptors, highlighting an impact of anthropogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion on phytoplankton.</p>

The G Protein <i>β</i>-Subunit, AGB1, Interacts with FERONIA in RALF1-Regulated Stomatal Movement
<p>Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins are composed of Gα, G<i>β</i>, and Gγ subunits and function as molecular switches in signal transduction. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), there are one canonical Gα (GPA1), three extra-large Gα (XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3), one G<i>β</i> (AGB1), and three Gγ (AGG1, AGG2, and AGG3) subunits. To elucidate AGB1 molecular signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation using plasma membrane-enriched proteins followed by mass spectrometry to identify the protein interactors of AGB1. After eliminating proteins present in the control immunoprecipitation, commonly identified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">contamin</span></strong>ants, and organellar proteins, a total of 103 candidate AGB1-associated proteins were confidently identified. We identified all of the G protein subunits except XLG1, receptor-like kinases, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling-related proteins, and 14-3-3-like proteins, all of which may couple with or modulate G protein signaling. We confirmed physical interaction between AGB1 and the receptor-like kinase FERONIA (FER) using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The Rapid Alkalinization Factor (RALF) family of polypeptides have been shown to be ligands of FER. In this study, we demonstrate that RALF1 regulates stomatal apertures and does so in a G protein-dependent manner, inhibiting stomatal opening and promoting stomatal closure in Columbia but not in <i>agb1</i> mutants. We further show that AGGs and XLGs, but not GPA1, participate in RALF1-mediated stomatal signaling. Our results suggest that FER acts as a G protein-coupled receptor for plant heterotrimeric G proteins.</p>

Nitric Oxide Mediates Nitrite-Sensing and Acclimation and Triggers a Remodeling of Lipids
<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is an intermediate of the nitrogen cycle, an industrial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ant, and a marker of climate change. NO also acts as a gaseous transmitter in a variety of biological processes. The impact of environmental NO needs to be addressed. In diatoms, a dominant phylum in phytoplankton, NO was reported to mediate programmed cell death in response to diatom-derived polyunsaturated aldehydes. Here, using the <i>Phaeodactylum</i> Pt1 strain, 2E,4E-decadienal supplied in the micromolar concentration range led to a nonspecific cell toxicity. We reexamined NO biosynthesis and response in <i>Phaeodactylum</i>. NO inhibits cell growth and triggers triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation. Feeding experiments indicate that NO is not produced from Arg but via conversion of nitrite by the nitrate reductase. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis shows that NO up-regulates the expression of the plastid nitrite reductase and genes involved in the subsequent incorporation of ammonium into amino acids, via both Gln synthesis and Orn-urea pathway. The phospho<i>enol</i>pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is also up-regulated, leading to the production of acetyl-CoA, which can feed TAG accumulation upon exposure to NO. Transcriptional reprogramming leading to higher TAG content is balanced with a decrease of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) in the plastid via posttranslational inhibition of MGDG synthase enzymatic activity by NO. Intracellular and transient NO emission acts therefore at the basis of a nitrite-sensing and acclimating system, whereas a long exposure to NO can additionally induce a redirection of carbon to neutral lipids and a stress response.</p>

Improving Plant Nitrogen Use Efficiency through Alteration of Amino Acid Transport Processes
<p>Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in plants could potentially increase crop yields while reducing N fertilization and, subsequently, environmental <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ion. Within most plants, N is transported primarily as amino acids. In this study, pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>) plants overexpressing <i>AMINO ACID PERMEASE1</i> (<i>AAP1</i>) were used to determine if and how genetic manipulation of amino acid transport from source to sink affects plant N use efficiency. The modified plants were grown under low, moderate, or high N fertilization regimes. The results showed that, independent of the N nutrition, the engineered plants allocate more N via the vasculature to the shoot and seeds and produce more biomass and higher seed yields than wild-type plants. Dependent on the amount of N supplied, the <i>AAP1</i>-overexpressing plants displayed improved N uptake or utilization efficiency, or a combination of the two. They also showed significantly increased N use efficiency in N-deficient as well as in N-rich soils and, impressively, required half the amount of N to produce as many fruits and seeds as control plants. Together, these data support that engineering N allocation from source to sink presents an effective strategy to produce crop plants with improved productivity as well as N use efficiency in a range of N environments.</p>

Reversible Leaf Xylem Collapse: A Potential “Circuit Breaker” against Cavitation
<p>We report a novel form of xylem dysfunction in angiosperms: reversible collapse of the xylem conduits of the smallest vein orders that demarcate and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intrus</span></strong>ively irrigate the areoles of red oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) leaves. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy revealed gradual increases in collapse from approximately −2 MPa down to −3 MPa, saturating thereafter (to −4 MPa). Over this range, cavitation remained negligible in these veins. Imaging of rehydration experiments showed spatially variable recovery from collapse within 20 s and complete recovery after 2 min. More broadly, the patterns of deformation induced by desiccation in both mesophyll and xylem suggest that cell wall collapse is unlikely to depend solely on individual wall properties, as mechanical constraints imposed by neighbors appear to be important. From the perspective of equilibrium leaf water potentials, petioles, whose vessels extend into the major veins, showed a vulnerability to cavitation that overlapped in the water potential domain with both minor vein collapse and buckling (turgor loss) of the living cells. However, models of transpiration transients showed that minor vein collapse and mesophyll capacitance could effectively buffer major veins from cavitation over time scales relevant to the rectification of stomatal wrong-way responses. We suggest that, for angiosperms, whose subsidiary cells give up large volumes to allow large stomatal apertures at the cost of potentially large wrong-way responses, vein collapse could make an important contribution to these plants’ ability to transpire near the brink of cavitation-inducing water potentials.</p>

Central Metabolic Responses to Ozone and Herbivory Affect Photosynthesis and Stomatal Closure
<p>Plants have evolved adaptive mechanisms that allow them to tolerate a continuous range of abiotic and biotic stressors. Tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), a global anthropogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">pollut</span></strong>ant, directly affects living organisms and ecosystems, including plant-herbivore interactions. In this study, we investigate the stress responses of <i>Brassica nigra</i> (wild black mustard) exposed consecutively to O<sub>3</sub> and the specialist herbivore <i>Pieris brassicae</i>. Transcriptomics and metabolomics data were evaluated using multivariate, correlation, and network analyses for the O<sub>3</sub> and herbivory responses. O<sub>3</sub> stress symptoms resembled those of senescence and phosphate starvation, while a sequential shift from O<sub>3</sub> to herbivory induced characteristic plant defense responses, including a decrease in central metabolism, induction of the jasmonic acid/ethylene pathways, and emission of volatiles. Omics network and pathway analyses predicted a link between glycerol and central energy metabolism that influences the osmotic stress response and stomatal closure. Further physiological measurements confirmed that while O<sub>3</sub> stress inhibited photosynthesis and carbon assimilation, sequential herbivory counteracted the initial responses induced by O<sub>3</sub>, resulting in a phenotype similar to that observed after herbivory alone. This study clarifies the consequences of multiple stress interactions on a plant metabolic system and also illustrates how omics data can be integrated to generate new hypotheses in ecology and plant physiology.</p>

Intra- and interspecific challenges modulate cortisol but not androgen levels in a year-round territorial damselfish
<p>Interactions between individuals of different species are commonplace in animal communities. Some behaviors displayed during these interspecific social interactions may be very similar to those displayed during intraspecific social interactions. However, whether functional analogies between intra- and interspecific behaviors translate at the proximate level into an overlap in their underlying endocrine mechanisms remains largely unknown. Because steroids both mediate social behaviors and respond to them, we approached this question by comparing the behavioral and steroid response of free-living dusky gregories (<i>Stegastes nigricans</i>) to standardized territorial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">intrus</span></strong>ions (sTI) of either conspecific or heterospecific food competitors. <i>Stegastes nigricans</i> is a year-round territorial fish that ‘cultivates’ the algae on which it feeds and is highly aggressive to both intra- and interspecific intruders. Behavioral differences between intra- and interspecific aggressive responses to sTI were marginal, and sTI tests caused an increase in cortisol levels that was positively related with the levels of aggression. In contrast, androgen levels did not increase in response to sTI, yet they showed a positive relationship with agonistic behavior. These results parallel a pattern that was first described for year-round territorial bird species. Furthermore, they suggest that changes in endocrine-hormone levels during territoriality might be independent of the species that induces the territorial response.</p>

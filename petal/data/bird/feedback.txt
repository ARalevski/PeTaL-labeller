Local and Systemic Metabolic Responses during Light-Induced Rapid Systemic Signaling
<p>Plants evolved multiple signaling pathways that transduce light-related signals between leaves. These are thought to improve light stress acclimation in a process termed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation. Although responses to light stress have been studied extensively in local leaves, and to a lesser degree in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves, little is known about the responses that occur in the different tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. These could be important in defining the specificity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response as well as in supporting the generation of different <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signals. Here, we report that local application of light stress to one rosette leaf of bolting Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants resulted in a metabolic response that encompassed local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic and transport tissues (stem tissues that connect the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues), demonstrating a high degree of physical and metabolic continuity between different tissues throughout the plant. Our results further indicate that the response of many of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically altered metabolites is associated with the function of the reactive oxygen species wave and that the levels of eight different metabolites are altered in a similar manner in all tissues tested (local, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic, and transport). These compounds could define a core metabolic signature for light stress that propagates from the local to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic leaves. Our findings suggest that metabolic changes occurring in cells that connect the local and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic tissues play an important role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic acquired acclimation and could convey specificity to the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic response of plants to light stress.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator is different from the average plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

SDH6 and SDH7 Contribute to Anchoring Succinate Dehydrogenase to the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The succinate dehydrogenase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> II) is a highly conserved protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> composed of the SDH1 to SDH4 subunits in bacteria and in the mitochondria of animals and fungi. The reason for the occurrence of up to four additional subunits in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> II of plants, termed SDH5 to SDH8, so far is a mystery. Here, we present a biochemical approach to investigate the internal subunit arrangement of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> II. Using low-concentration detergent treatments, the holo <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> is dissected into sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es that are analyzed by a three-dimensional gel electrophoresis <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Protein identifications by mass spectrometry revealed that the largest sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> (IIa) represents the succinate dehydrogenase domain composed of SDH1 and SDH2. Another sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> (IIb) is composed of the SDH3, SDH4, SDH6, and SDH7 subunits. All four proteins include transmembrane helices and together form the membrane anchor of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> II. Sequence analysis revealed that SDH3 and SDH4 lack helices conserved in other organisms. Using homology modeling and phylogenetic analyses, we present evidence that SDH6 and SDH7 substitute missing sequence stretches of SDH3 and SDH4 in plants. Together with SDH5, which is liberated upon dissection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> II into sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es, SDH6 and SDH7 also add some hydrophilic mass to plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> II, which possibly inserts further functions into this smallest protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> of the oxidative phosphorylation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (which is not so small in plants).</p>

Vocal production complexity correlates with neural instructions in the oyster toadfish (<i>Opsanus tau</i>)
<p>Sound communication is fundamental to many social interactions and essential to courtship and agonistic behaviours in many vertebrates. The swimbladder and associated muscles in batrachoidid fishes (midshipman and toadfish) is a unique vertebrate sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, wherein fundamental frequencies are determined directly by the firing rate of a vocal-acoustic neural network that drives the contraction frequency of superfast swimbladder muscles. The oyster toadfish boatwhistle call starts with an irregular sound waveform that could be an emergent property of the peripheral nonlinear sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or reflect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> encoding in the central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Here, we demonstrate that the start of the boatwhistle is indicative of a chaotic strange attractor, and tested whether its origin lies in the peripheral sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> or in the vocal motor network. We recorded sound and swimbladder muscle activity in awake, freely behaving toadfish during motor nerve stimulation, and recorded sound, motor nerve and muscle activity during spontaneous grunts. The results show that rhythmic motor volleys do not cause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> sound signals. However, arrhythmic recruitment of swimbladder muscle during spontaneous grunts correlates with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> sounds. This supports the hypothesis that the irregular start of the boatwhistle is encoded in the vocal pre-motor neural network, and not caused by peripheral interactions with the sound-producing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. We suggest that sound production <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> demands across vocal tetrapods have selected for muscles and motorneurons adapted for speed, which can execute <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> neural instructions into equivalently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> vocalisations.</p>

Sheet-Like Remodeling of the Transverse Tubular System in Human Heart Failure Impairs Excitation-Contraction Coupling and Functional Recovery by Mechanical Unloading
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac recovery in response to mechanical unloading by left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) has been demonstrated in subgroups of patients with chronic heart failure (HF). Hallmarks of HF are depletion and disorganization of the transverse tubular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>) in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated remodeling of the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in human end-stage HF and its role in cardiac recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Left ventricular biopsies were obtained from 5 donors and 26 patients with chronic HF undergoing implantation of LVADs. Three-dimensional confocal microscopy and computational image analysis were applied to assess t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> structure, density, and distance of ryanodine receptor clusters to the sarcolemma, including the t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>. Recovery of cardiac function in response to mechanical unloading was assessed by echocardiography during turndown of the LVAD.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The majority of HF myocytes showed remarkable t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remodeling, particularly sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma. Circularity of t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> components was decreased in HF versus controls (0.37±0.01 versus 0.46±0.02; <i>P</i><0.01), and the volume/length ratio was increased in HF (0.36±0.01 versus 0.25±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup>; <i>P</i><0.0001). T-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density was reduced in HF, leading to increased ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances (0.96±0.05 versus 0.64±0.1 µm; <i>P</i><0.01). Low ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances at the time of LVAD implantation predicted high post-LVAD left ventricular ejection fractions (<i>P</i><0.01) and ejection fraction increases during unloading (<i>P</i><0.01). Ejection fraction in patients with pre-LVAD ryanodine receptor–sarcolemma distances >1 µm did not improve after mechanical unloading. In addition, calcium transients were recorded in field-stimulated isolated human cardiomyocytes and analyzed with respect to local t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density. Calcium release in HF myocytes was restricted to regions proximal to the sarcolemma. Local calcium upstroke was delayed (23.9±4.9 versus 10.3±1.7 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.05) and more asynchronous (18.1±1.5 versus 8.9±2.2 milliseconds; <i>P</i><0.01) in HF cells with low t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density versus cells with high t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> density.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The t-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in end-stage human HF presents a characteristic novel phenotype consisting of sheet-like invaginations of the sarcolemma.

Exotic states in a simple network of nanoelectromechanical oscillators
<p>Synchronization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators, a phenomenon found in a wide variety of natural and engineered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, is typically understood through a reduction to a first-order phase model with simplified dynamics. Here, by exploiting the precision and flexibility of nanoelectromechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, we examined the dynamics of a ring of quasi-sinusoidal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators at and beyond first order. Beyond first order, we found exotic states of synchronization with highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> dynamics, including weak chimeras, decoupled states, traveling waves, and inhomogeneous synchronized states. Through theory and experiment, we show that these exotic states rely on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> interactions emerging out of networks with simple linear nearest-neighbor coupling. This work provides insight into the dynamical richness of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s with weak nonlinearities and local interactions.</p>

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator
<p>In metals, orbital motions of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in magnetic fields, which is manifested by quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in electrical resistivity. This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here, we report a notable exception in an insulator—ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB<sub>12</sub>). The resistivity of YbB<sub>12</sub>, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in metals, exhibits distinct quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations. These unconventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations arise from the insulating bulk, even though the temperature dependence of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lation amplitude follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of metals with a large effective mass.

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>latory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and metabolism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the rotation of the planet. Photosynthesis is a key metabolic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of photosynthesis, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from photosynthesis also feeds back to regulate the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by stabilizing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the stability of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator period are thought to adjust the timing of biological activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the dynamic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the dynamic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of biological events. Our data provide insight into how the dynamic period adjustment of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

NDH-PSI Supercomplex Assembly Precedes Full Assembly of the NDH Complex in Chloroplast
<p>The chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> is structurally similar to respiratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> I and mediates PSI cyclic electron flow. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), chloroplast NDH is composed of at least 29 subunits and associates with two copies of PSI to form the NDH-PSI super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>. Here, we found that CHLORORESPIRATORY REDUCTION3 (CRR3) is an assembly factor required for the accumulation of sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> B (SubB) of chloroplast NDH. In Suc density gradient centrifugation, CRR3 was detected in three protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es. Accumulation of the largest peak III <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> was impaired in mutants defective in the SubB subunits PnsB2-PnsB5. The oligomeric form of CRR3 likely functions to assemble the core of SubB to form the peak III <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> as an assembly intermediate. A defect in the PnsL3 subunit increased the level of the peak III <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>, suggesting that CRR3 was released from the assembly intermediate after PnsL3 binding. Unlike PnsB2-PnsB5 and PnsL3, PnsB1 was not absolutely necessary for stabilizing SubB. PnsB1 is likely incorporated into the intermediate at the final step during SubB assembly. Lhca6 is a linker protein mediating NDH-PSI super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> formation, and its site of contact with NDH was suggested to be SubB. In the <i>lhca6</i> mutant, accumulation of the peak III <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> was impaired, suggesting that SubB interacted with Lhca6 during the step of SubB assembly. The process of super<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> formation was triggered before the completion of the NDH assembly. Consistent with its predicted function, CRR3 accumulated in young leaves, where the NDH <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> was assembled.</p>

Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy structures of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> pre-B and B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es at average resolutions of 3.3 to 4.6 and 3.9 angstroms, respectively. In the pre-B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>, the duplex between the 5′ splice site (5′SS) and U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is recognized by Yhc1, Luc7, and the Sm ring. In the B <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>, U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein is dissociated, the 5′-exon–5′SS sequences are translocated near U6 snRNA, and three B-specific proteins may orient the precursor messenger RNA. In both <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es, U6 snRNA is anchored to loop I of U5 snRNA, and the duplex between the branch point sequence and U2 snRNA is recognized by the SF3b <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>. Structural analysis reveals the mechanism of assembly and activation for the yeast spliceosome.</p>

A silicon Brillouin laser
<p>Brillouin laser <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators offer powerful and flexible dynamics as the basis for mode-locked lasers, microwave <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators, and optical gyroscopes in a variety of optical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin lasers. The recent advent of hybrid photonic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon. In this study, we have harnessed these engineered nonlinearities to demonstrate Brillouin lasing in silicon. Moreover, we show that this silicon-based Brillouin laser enters a regime of dynamics in which optical self-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lation produces phonon linewidth narrowing. Our results provide a platform to develop a range of applications for monolithic integration within silicon photonic circuits.</p>

A bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve
<p>The distributed network of receptors, neurons, and synapses in the somatosensory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> efficiently processes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> tactile information. We used flexible organic electronics to mimic the functions of a sensory nerve. Our artificial afferent nerve collects pressure information (1 to 80 kilopascals) from clusters of pressure sensors, converts the pressure information into action potentials (0 to 100 hertz) by using ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators, and integrates the action potentials from multiple ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lators with a synaptic transistor. Biomimetic hierarchical structures can detect movement of an object, combine simultaneous pressure inputs, and distinguish braille characters. Furthermore, we connected our artificial afferent nerve to motor nerves to construct a hybrid bioelectronic reflex arc to actuate muscles. Our <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> has potential applications in neurorobotics and neuroprosthetics.</p>

Thermal proximity coaggregation for system-wide profiling of protein complex dynamics in cells
<p>Proteins differentially interact with each other across cellular states and conditions, but an efficient proteome-wide strategy to monitor them is lacking. We report the application of thermal proximity coaggregation (TPCA) for high-throughput intracellular monitoring of protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> dynamics. Significant TPCA signatures observed among well-validated protein-protein interactions correlate positively with interaction stoichiometry and are statistically observable in more than 350 annotated human protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es. Using TPCA, we identified many <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es without detectable differential protein expression, including chromatin-associated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es, modulated in S phase of the cell cycle. Comparison of six cell lines by TPCA revealed cell-specific interactions even in fundamental cellular processes. TPCA constitutes an approach for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>-wide studies of protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es in nonengineered cells and tissues and might be used to identify protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es that are modulated in diseases.</p>

Calibrated mitotic oscillator drives motile ciliogenesis
<p>Cell division and differentiation depend on massive and rapid organelle remodeling. The mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator, centered on the cyclin-dependent kinase 1–anaphase-promoting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>/cyclosome (CDK1-APC/C) axis, spatiotemporally coordinates this reorganization in dividing cells. Here we discovered that nondividing cells could also implement this mitotic clocklike regulatory circuit to orchestrate subcellular reorganization associated with differentiation. We probed centriole amplification in differentiating mouse-brain multiciliated cells. These postmitotic progenitors fine-tuned mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator activity to drive the orderly progression of centriole production, maturation, and motile ciliation while avoiding the mitosis commitment threshold. Insufficient CDK1 activity hindered differentiation, whereas excessive activity accelerated differentiation yet drove postmitotic progenitors into mitosis. Thus, postmitotic cells can redeploy and calibrate the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lator to uncouple cytoplasmic from nuclear dynamics for organelle remodeling associated with differentiation.</p>

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices
<p>Cyclotron motion of charge carriers in metals and semiconductors leads to Landau quantization and magneto-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>latory behavior in their properties. Cryogenic temperatures are usually required to observe these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations.

The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that charge carriers experience effectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell.

CyanoGate: A Modular Cloning Suite for Engineering Cyanobacteria Based on the Plant MoClo Syntax
<p>Recent advances in synthetic biology research have been underpinned by an exponential increase in available genomic information and a proliferation of advanced DNA assembly tools. The adoption of plasmid vector assembly standards and parts libraries has greatly enhanced the reproducibility of research and the exchange of parts between different labs and biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. However, a standardized modular cloning (MoClo) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is not yet available for cyanobacteria, which lag behind other prokaryotes in synthetic biology despite their huge potential regarding biotechnological applications. By building on the assembly library and syntax of the Plant Golden Gate MoClo kit, we have developed a versatile <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> called CyanoGate that unites cyanobacteria with plant and algal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Here, we describe the generation of a suite of parts and acceptor vectors for making (1) marked/unmarked knock-outs or integrations using an integrative acceptor vector, and (2) transient multigene expression and repression <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s using known and previously undescribed replicative vectors. We tested and compared the CyanoGate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in the established model cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and the more recently described fast-growing strain <i>Synechococcus elongatus</i> UTEX 2973. The UTEX 2973 fast-growth phenotype was only evident under specific growth conditions; however, UTEX 2973 accumulated high levels of proteins with strong native or synthetic promoters. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is publicly available and can be readily expanded to accommodate other standardized MoClo parts to accelerate the development of reliable synthetic biology tools for the cyanobacterial community.</p>

The DnaJ-Like Zinc-Finger Protein HCF222 Is Required for Thylakoid Membrane Biogenesis in Plants
<p>To understand the biogenesis of the thylakoid membrane in higher plants and to identify auxiliary proteins required to build up this highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, we have characterized the allelic nuclear mutants <i>high chlorophyll fluorescence222-1</i> (<i>hcf222-1</i>) and <i>hcf222-2</i> and isolated the causal gene by map-based cloning. In the ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant <i>hcf222-1</i>, the accumulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> (Cytb6f) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> was reduced to 30% compared with the wild type. Other thylakoid membrane <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es accumulated to normal levels. The T-DNA knockout mutant <i>hcf222-2</i> showed a more severe defect with respect to thylakoid membrane proteins and accumulated only 10% of the Cytb6f <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>, accompanied by a reduction in photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> II, the photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> II light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>, and photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> I. <i>HCF222</i> encodes a protein of 99 amino acids in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) that has similarities to the cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain of DnaJ chaperones. The insulin precipitation assay demonstrated that HCF222 has disulfide reductase activity in vitro. The protein is conserved in higher plants and bryophytes but absent in algae and cyanobacteria. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that a fraction of HCF222-green fluorescent protein was detectable in the endoplasmic reticulum but that it also could be recognized in chloroplasts. A fusion construct of HCF222 containing a plastid transit peptide targets the protein into chloroplasts and was able to complement the mutational defect. These findings indicate that the chloroplast-targeted HCF222 is indispensable for the maturation and/or assembly of the Cytb6f <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> and is very likely involved in thiol-disulfide biochemistry at the thylakoid membrane.</p>

Correcting for Differential Transcript Coverage Reveals a Strong Relationship between Alternative Splicing and Organism Complexity
<p>What at the genomic level underlies organism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>ity? Although several genomic features have been associated with organism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>ity, in the case of alternative splicing, which has long been proposed to explain the variation in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>ity, no such link has been established. Here, we analyzed over 39 million expressed sequence tags available for 47 eukaryotic species with fully sequenced genomes to obtain a comparable index of alternative splicing estimates, which corrects for the distorting effect of a variable number of transcripts per species—an important obstacle for comparative studies of alternative splicing. We find that alternative splicing has steadily increased over the last 1,400 My of eukaryotic evolution and is strongly associated with organism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>ity, assayed as the number of cell types. Importantly, this association is not explained as a by-product of covariance between alternative splicing with other variables previously linked to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>ity including gene content, protein length, proteome disorder, and protein interactivity. In addition, we found no evidence to suggest that the relationship of alternative splicing to cell type number is explained by drift due to reduced <i>N</i><sub>e</sub> in more <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> species. Taken together, our results firmly establish alternative splicing as a significant predictor of organism <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>ity and are, in principle, consistent with an important role of transcript diversification through alternative splicing as a means of determining a genome’s functional information capacity.</p>

Role of insulin signaling impairment, adiponectin and dyslipidemia in peripheral and central neuropathy in mice
<p>One of the tissues or organs affected by diabetes is the nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, predominantly the peripheral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> (peripheral polyneuropathy and/or painful peripheral neuropathy) but also the central <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> with impaired learning, memory and mental flexibility. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pre-diabetic or diabetic condition caused by a high-fat diet (HFD) can damage both the peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Groups of C57BL6 and Swiss Webster mice were fed a diet containing 60% fat for 8 months and compared to control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic groups that were fed a standard diet containing 10% fat. Aspects of peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity, thermal sensitivity) and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> function (learning ability, memory) were measured at assorted times during the study. Both strains of mice on HFD developed impaired glucose tolerance, indicative of insulin resistance, but only the C57BL6 mice showed statistically significant hyperglycemia. STZ-diabetic C57BL6 mice developed learning deficits in the Barnes maze after 8 weeks of diabetes, whereas neither C57BL6 nor Swiss Webster mice fed a HFD showed signs of defects at that time point. By 6 months on HFD, Swiss Webster mice developed learning and memory deficits in the Barnes maze test, whereas their peripheral nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> remained normal. In contrast, C57BL6 mice fed the HFD developed peripheral nerve dysfunction, as indicated by nerve conduction slowing and thermal hyperalgesia, but showed normal learning and memory functions. Our data indicate that STZ-induced diabetes or a HFD can damage both peripheral and central nervous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, but learning deficits develop more rapidly in insulin-deficient than in insulin-resistant conditions and only in Swiss Webster mice. In addition to insulin impairment, dyslipidemia or adiponectinemia might determine the neuropathy phenotype.</p>

Hydrophobic patches on SMAD2 and SMAD3 determine selective binding to cofactors
<p>The transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) superfamily of cytokines regulates various biological processes, including cell proliferation, immune responses, autophagy, and senescence. Dysregulation of TGF-β signaling causes various diseases, such as cancer and fibrosis. SMAD2 and SMAD3 are core transcription factors involved in TGF-β signaling, and they form heterotrimeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es with SMAD4 (SMAD2-SMAD2-SMAD4, SMAD3-SMAD3-SMAD4, and SMAD2-SMAD3-SMAD4) in response to TGF-β signaling. These heterotrimeric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es interact with cofactors to control the expression of TGF-β–dependent genes. SMAD2 and SMAD3 may promote or repress target genes depending on whether they form <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es with other transcription factors, coactivators, or corepressors; therefore, the selection of specific cofactors is critical for the appropriate activity of these transcription factors. To reveal the structural basis by which SMAD2 and SMAD3 select cofactors, we determined the crystal structures of SMAD3 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> with the transcription factor FOXH1 and SMAD2 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> with the transcriptional corepressor SKI. The structures of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es show that the MAD homology 2 (MH2) domains of SMAD2 and SMAD3 have multiple hydrophobic patches on their surfaces. The cofactors tether to various subsets of these patches to interact with SMAD2 and SMAD3 in a cooperative or competitive manner to control the output of TGF-β signaling.</p>

Independent Regulation of Symbiotic Nodulation by the SUNN Negative and CRA2 Positive Systemic Pathways
<p>Plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on nutrient availability. In legumes, two <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways have been reported in the <i>Medicago truncatula</i> model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the <i>M. truncatula</i> Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway acts <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric Nodule (SUNN) receptor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was observed in <i>cra2</i> mutants but not in <i>sunn</i> and <i>cra2 sunn</i> mutants. Overall, these results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic pathways act independently from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.</p>

OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 Form a Transient Functional Complex with the Photosystem II Reaction Center
<p>The reaction center (RC) of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> II (PSII), which is composed of D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i> subunits, forms at an early stage of PSII biogenesis. However, it is largely unclear how these components assemble to form a functional unit. In this work, we show that synthesis of the PSII core proteins D1/D2 and formation of the PSII RC is blocked specifically in the absence of ONE-HELIX PROTEIN1 (OHP1) and OHP2 proteins in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), indicating that OHP1 and OHP2 are essential for the formation of the PSII RC. Mutagenesis of the chlorophyll-binding residues in OHP proteins impairs their function and/or stability, suggesting that they may function in the binding of chlorophyll in vivo. We further show that OHP1, OHP2, and HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244), together with D1, D2, PsbI, and cytochrome <i>b559</i>, form a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>. We designated this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> the PSII RC-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> to distinguish it from the RC sub<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> in the intact PSII <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>.

In a subsequent stage of PSII biogenesis, OHP1, OHP2, and HCF244 are released from the PSII RC-like <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> and replaced by the other PSII subunits. Together with previous reports on the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i>, our results demonstrate that the process of PSII RC assembly is highly conserved among photosynthetic species.</p>

Dynamic Changes between Two LHCX-Related Energy Quenching Sites Control Diatom Photoacclimation
<p>Marine diatoms are prominent phytoplankton organisms that perform photosynthesis in extremely variable environments. Diatoms possess a strong ability to dissipate excess absorbed energy as heat via nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). This process relies on changes in carotenoid pigment composition (xanthophyll cycle) and on specific members of the light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> family specialized in photoprotection (LHCXs), which potentially act as NPQ effectors. However, the link between light stress, NPQ, and the existence of different LHCX isoforms is not understood in these organisms. Using picosecond fluorescence analysis, we observed two types of NPQ in the pennate diatom <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i> that were dependent on light conditions. Short exposure of low-light-acclimated cells to high light triggers the onset of energy quenching close to the core of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> II, while prolonged light stress activates NPQ in the antenna. Biochemical analysis indicated a link between the changes in the NPQ site/mechanism and the induction of different LHCX isoforms, which accumulate either in the antenna <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es or in the core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>. By comparing the responses of wild-type cells and transgenic lines with a reduced expression of the major LHCX isoform, LHCX1, we conclude that core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>-associated NPQ is more effective in photoprotection than is the antenna <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>. Overall, our data clarify the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> molecular scenario of light responses in diatoms and provide a rationale for the existence of a degenerate family of LHCX proteins in these algae.</p>

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants
<p>Non-cell autonomous RNA silencing can spread from cell to cell and over long distances in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile gene silencing are poorly understood. Here, we identified a <i>DICER-LIKE2</i> (<i>DCL2</i>)<i>-</i>dependent mechanism for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic spread of posttranscriptional RNA silencing, also known as posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. Using a suite of transgenic <i>DCL</i> RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that <i>N. benthamiana</i> DCL1, DCL2, DCL3, and DCL4 are required to produce microRNAs and 22, 24, and 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All investigated siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of <i>DCL2</i> expression reduced the spread of gene silencing, while suppression of <i>DCL3</i> or <i>DCL4</i> expression enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. In contrast to <i>DCL4</i> RNAi lines, <i>DCL2</i>-<i>DCL4</i> double-RNAi lines developed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS similar to that observed in <i>DCL2</i> RNAi. We further showed that the 21 or 24 nt local siRNAs produced by DCL4 or DCL3 were not involved in long-distance gene silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that <i>DCL2</i> was required in the scion to respond to the signal, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated <i>DCL</i> genetic pathway in which <i>DCL2</i> plays an essential role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS in <i>N. benthamiana</i>, while both <i>DCL4</i> and <i>DCL3</i> attenuate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.

The role of the GET <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> in Arabidopsis was investigated by monitoring the membrane insertion of a tail-anchored protein, SYP72, a syntaxin. SYP72 bound to yeast Get3 in vitro, forming a Get3-SYP72 fusion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> that could be inserted into yeast GET1/2-containing proteoliposomes. The Arabidopsis GET <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> functioned in vivo to insert TA proteins into ER membranes as demonstrated by the fact that the YFP-tagged SYP72 localized to the ER in wild-type plants but accumulated as cytoplasmic inclusions in <i>get1</i>, <i>get3</i>, or <i>get4</i> mutants. The GET mutants <i>get1</i> and <i>get3</i> were less tolerant of ER stress agents and showed symptoms of ER stress even under unstressed conditions. Hence, the GET <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> is responsible for the insertion of TA proteins into the ER in Arabidopsis, and mutants with GET dysfunctions are more susceptible to ER stress.</p>

The principles of cascading power limits in small, fast biological and engineered systems
<p>Mechanical power limitations emerge from the physical trade-off between force and velocity. Many biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s incorporate power-enhancing mechanisms enabling extraordinary accelerations at small sizes. We establish how power enhancement emerges through the dynamic coupling of motors, springs, and latches and reveal how each displays its own force-velocity behavior. We mathematically demonstrate a tunable performance space for spring-actuated movement that is applicable to biological and synthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. Incorporating nonideal spring behavior and parameterizing latch dynamics allows the identification of critical transitions in mass and trade-offs in spring scaling, both of which offer explanations for long-observed scaling patterns in biological <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s. This analysis defines the cascading challenges of power enhancement, explores their emergent effects in biological and engineered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, and charts a pathway for higher-level analysis and synthesis of power-amplified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s.</p>

Structure of a human catalytic step I spliceosome
<p>Splicing by the spliceosome involves branching and exon ligation. The branching reaction leads to the formation of the catalytic step I spliceosome (C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>). Here we report the cryo–electron microscopy structure of the human C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> at an average resolution of 4.1 angstroms. Compared with the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>, the human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> contains 11 additional proteins. The step I splicing factors CCDC49 and CCDC94 (Cwc25 and Yju2 in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, respectively) closely interact with the DEAH-family adenosine triphosphatase/helicase Prp16 and bridge the gap between Prp16 and the active-site RNA elements. These features, together with structural comparison of the human C and C* <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es, provide mechanistic insights into ribonucleoprotein remodeling and allow the proposition of a working mechanism for the C-to-C* transition.</p>

RNA editing with CRISPR-Cas13
<p>Nucleic acid editing holds promise for treating genetic disease, particularly at the RNA level, where disease-relevant sequences can be rescued to yield functional protein products. Type VI CRISPR-Cas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s contain the programmable single-effector RNA-guided ribonuclease Cas13. We profiled type VI <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in order to engineer a Cas13 ortholog capable of robust knockdown and demonstrated RNA editing by using catalytically inactive Cas13 (dCas13) to direct adenosine-to-inosine deaminase activity by ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 2) to transcripts in mammalian cells. This <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, referred to as RNA Editing for Programmable A to I Replacement (REPAIR), which has no strict sequence constraints, can be used to edit full-length transcripts containing pathogenic mutations.

Structure of the complete elongation complex of RNA polymerase II with basal factors
<p>In the early stage of transcription, eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (Pol II) exchanges initiation factors with elongation factors to form an elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> for processive transcription. Here we report the structure of the Pol II elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> bound with the basal elongation factors Spt4/5, Elf1, and TFIIS. Spt4/5 (the Spt4/Spt5 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>) and Elf1 modify a wide area of the Pol II surface. Elf1 bridges the Pol II central cleft, completing a “DNA entry tunnel” for downstream DNA. Spt4 and the Spt5 NGN and KOW1 domains encircle the upstream DNA, constituting a “DNA exit tunnel.” The Spt5 KOW4 and KOW5 domains augment the “RNA exit tunnel,” directing the exiting nascent RNA. Thus, the elongation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> establishes a completely different transcription and regulation platform from that of the initiation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es.</p>

A cyclic oligonucleotide signaling pathway in type III CRISPR-Cas systems
<p>Type III CRISPR-Cas <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in prokaryotes provide immunity against invading nucleic acids through the coordinated degradation of transcriptionally active DNA and its transcripts by the Csm effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>.

We show here that target RNA binding by the Csm effector <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> of <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i> triggers Cas10 to synthesize cyclic oligoadenylates (cA<i><sub>n</sub></i>; <i>n</i> = 2 to 6) by means of the Palm domains.

This cyclic oligoadenylate–based signaling pathway coordinates different components of CRISPR-Cas to prevent phage infection and propagation.</p>

Breaking Lorentz reciprocity to overcome the time-bandwidth limit in physics and engineering
<p>A century-old tenet in physics and engineering asserts that any type of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>, having bandwidth Δω, can interact with a wave over only a constrained time period Δ<i>t</i> inversely proportional to the bandwidth (Δ<i>t</i>·Δω ~ 2π). This law severely limits the generic capabilities of all types of resonant and wave-guiding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s in photonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics and optomechanics, acoustics, continuum mechanics, and atomic and optical physics but is thought to be completely fundamental, arising from basic Fourier reciprocity. We propose that this “fundamental” limit can be overcome in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s where Lorentz reciprocity is broken. As a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> becomes more asymmetric in its transport properties, the degree to which the limit can be surpassed becomes greater. By way of example, we theoretically demonstrate how, in an astutely designed magnetized semiconductor heterostructure, the above limit can be exceeded by orders of magnitude by using realistic material parameters. Our findings revise prevailing paradigms for linear, time-invariant resonant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s, challenging the doctrine that high-quality resonances must invariably be narrowband and providing the possibility of developing devices with unprecedentedly high time-bandwidth performance.</p>

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within communities can interact to organize their behavior. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the behavior of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm communities undergoing metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations can become coupled through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. Coupling increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms resolve this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong></span></strong>lations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their behavior to resolve nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>s to allocate limited resources.</p>

Structure of a yeast step II catalytically activated spliceosome
<p>Each cycle of precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing comprises two sequential reactions, first freeing the 5′ exon and generating an intron lariat–3′ exon and then ligating the two exons and releasing the intron lariat. The second reaction is executed by the step II catalytically activated spliceosome (known as the C* <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>). Here, we present the cryo–electron microscopy structure of a C* <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> at an average resolution of 4.0 angstroms. Compared with the preceding spliceosomal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> (C <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>), the lariat junction has been translocated by 15 to 20 angstroms to vacate space for the incoming 3′-exon sequences. The step I splicing factors Cwc25 and Yju2 have been dissociated from the active site. Two catalytic motifs from Prp8 (the 1585 loop and the β finger of the ribonuclease H–like domain), along with the step II splicing factors Prp17 and Prp18 and other surrounding proteins, are poised to assist the second transesterification.

Polar Localization of the Borate Exporter BOR1 Requires AP2-Dependent Endocytosis
<p>Boron (B) is an essential element in plants but is toxic when it accumulates to high levels. In root cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the borate exporter BOR1 is polarly localized in the plasma membrane toward the stele side for directional transport of B. Upon high-B supply, BOR1 is rapidly internalized and degraded in the vacuole. The polar localization and B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 are mediated by endocytosis from the plasma membrane. To dissect the endocytic pathways mediating the polar localization and vacuolar sorting, we investigated the contribution of the clathrin adaptor protein, ADAPTOR PROTEIN2 (AP2) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>, to BOR1 trafficking. In the mutants lacking µ- or σ-subunits of the AP2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>, the polar localization and constitutive endocytosis of BOR1 under low-B conditions were dramatically disturbed. A coimmunoprecipitation assay showed association of the AP2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> with BOR1, while it was independent of YxxΦ sorting motifs, which are in a cytosolic loop of BOR1. A yeast two-hybrid assay supported the interaction of the AP2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> µ-subunit with the C-terminal tail but not with the YxxΦ motifs in the cytosolic loop of BOR1. Intriguingly, lack of the AP2 subunit did not affect the B-induced rapid internalization/vacuolar sorting of BOR1. Consistent with defects in the polar localization, the AP2 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> mutants showed hypersensitivity to B deficiency. Our results indicate that AP2-dependent endocytosis maintains the polar localization of BOR1 to support plant growth under low-B conditions, whereas the B-induced vacuolar sorting of BOR1 is mediated through an AP2-independent endocytic pathway.</p>

Medicago LINC Complexes Function in Nuclear Morphology, Nuclear Movement, and Root Nodule Symbiosis

ONE-HELIX PROTEIN2 (OHP2) Is Required for the Stability of OHP1 and Assembly Factor HCF244 and Is Functionally Linked to PSII Biogenesis
<p>The members of the light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> protein family, which include the one-helix proteins (OHPs), are characterized by one to four membrane-spanning helices. These proteins function in light absorption and energy dissipation, sensing light intensity, and triggering photomorphogenesis or the binding of chlorophyll and intermediates of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) contains two OHPs, while four homologs (named high-light-induced proteins) exist in <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC6803. Various functions have been assigned to high-light-induced proteins, ranging from photoprotection and the assembly of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> I (PSI) and PSII to regulation of the early steps of chlorophyll biosynthesis, but little is known about the function of the two plant OHPs. Here, we show that the two Arabidopsis OHPs form heterodimers and that the stromal part of OHP2 interacts with the plastid-localized PSII assembly factor HIGH CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE244 (HCF244). Moreover, concurrent accumulation of the two OHPs and HCF244 is critical for the stability of all three proteins. In particular, the absence of OHP2 leads to the complete loss of OHP1 and HCF244. We used a virus-induced gene silencing approach to minimize the expression of <i>OHP1</i> or <i>OHP2</i> in adult Arabidopsis plants and revealed that OHP2 is essential for the accumulation of the PSII core subunits, while the other photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es and the major light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> proteins remained unaffected.

Temporal Proteomics of Inducible RNAi Lines of Clp Protease Subunits Identifies Putative Protease Substrates
<p>The Clp protease in the chloroplasts of plant cells is a large <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> composed of at least 13 nucleus-encoded subunits and one plastid-encoded subunit, which are arranged in several ring-like structures. The proteolytic P-ring and the structurally similar R-ring form the core <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> that contains the proteolytic chamber. Chaperones of the HSP100 family help with substrate unfolding, and additional accessory proteins are believed to assist with Clp <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> assembly and/or to promote <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> stability. Although the structure and function of the Clp protease have been studied in great detail in both bacteria and chloroplasts, the identification of bona fide protease substrates has been very challenging. Knockout mutants of genes for protease subunits are of limited value, due to their often pleiotropic phenotypes and the difficulties with distinguishing primary effects (i.e. overaccumulation of proteins that represent genuine protease substrates) from secondary effects (proteins overaccumulating for other reasons). Here, we have developed a new strategy for the identification of candidate substrates of plant proteases. By combining ethanol-inducible knockdown of protease subunits with time-resolved analysis of changes in the proteome, proteins that respond immediately to reduced protease activity can be identified. In this way, secondary effects are minimized and putative protease substrates can be identified. We have applied this strategy to the Clp protease <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> of tobacco (<i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>) and identified a set of chloroplast proteins that are likely degraded by Clp. These include several metabolic enzymes but also a small number of proteins involved in photosynthesis.</p>

A Genetic Screen for Impaired Systemic RNAi Highlights the Crucial Role of DICER-LIKE 2
<p>Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of transgenes involves abundant 21-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and low-abundance 22-nucleotide siRNAs produced from double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by DCL4 and DCL2, respectively. However, DCL2 facilitates the recruitment of RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) to ARGONAUTE 1-derived cleavage products, resulting in more efficient amplification of secondary and transitive dsRNA and siRNAs. Here, we describe a reporter <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> where RDR6-dependent PTGS is initiated by restricted expression of an inverted-repeat dsRNA specifically in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) root tip, allowing a genetic screen to identify mutants impaired in RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Our screen identified <i>dcl2</i> but not <i>dcl4</i> mutants. Moreover, grafting experiments showed that DCL2, but not DCL4, is required in both the source rootstock and the recipient shoot tissue for efficient RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS. Furthermore, <i>dcl4</i> rootstocks produced more DCL2-dependent 22-nucleotide siRNAs than the wild type and showed enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic movement of PTGS to grafted shoots. Thus, along with its role in recruiting RDR6 for further amplification of PTGS, DCL2 is crucial for RDR6-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong>ic PTGS.</p>

Transcriptome Association Identifies Regulators of Wheat Spike Architecture
<p>The architecture of wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) inflorescence and its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>ity is among the most important agronomic traits that influence yield. For example, wheat spikes vary considerably in the number of spikelets, which are specialized reproductive branches, and the number of florets, which are spikelet branches that produce seeds. The large and repetitive nature of the three homologous and highly similar subgenomes of wheat has impeded attempts at using genetic approaches to uncover beneficial alleles that can be utilized for yield improvement. Using a population-associative transcriptomic approach, we analyzed the transcriptomes of developing spikes in 90 wheat lines comprising 74 landrace and 16 elite varieties and correlated expression with variations in spike <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>ity traits.

A Light Harvesting Complex-Like Protein in Maintenance of Photosynthetic Components in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>

Msf1 belongs to the superfamily of light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> proteins with three transmembrane domains and consensus chlorophyll-binding sites. Loss of Msf1 leads to reduced accumulation of photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">system</span></strong> I and chlorophyll-binding proteins/<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>es. Msf1is a component of a thylakoid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong> containing key enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, thus revealing a possible link between Msf1 and chlorophyll biosynthesis. Protein interaction assays and greening experiments demonstrate that Msf1 interacts with Copper target homolog1 (CHL27B) and accumulates concomitantly with chlorophyll in <i>Chlamydomonas</i>, implying that chlorophyll stabilizes Msf1. Contrary to other light-harvesting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">complex</span></strong>-like genes, the expression of <i>Msf1</i> is not stimulated by high-light stress, but its protein level increases significantly under heat shock, iron and copper limitation, as well as in stationary cells.

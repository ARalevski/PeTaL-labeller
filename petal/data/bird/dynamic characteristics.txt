p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Many of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics are highly stereotyped, such as oscillations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance oscillated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the oscillations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous induction. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led the signaling landscape of p53 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Because the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

Improving mechanical sensor performance through larger damping
<p>Mechanical resonances are used in a wide variety of devices, from smartphone accelerometers to computer clocks and from wireless filters to atomic force microscopes. Frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity, a critical performance metric, is generally assumed to be tantamount to resonance quality factor (the inverse of the linewidth and of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing). We show that the frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of resonant nanomechanical sensors can be improved by lowering the quality factor. At high <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</span></strong>s, quality-factor reduction is completely mitigated by increases in signal-to-noise ratio. At low <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</span></strong>s, notably, increased <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing leads to better <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity and sensor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, with improvement proportional to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">damp</span></strong>ing. We confirm the findings by demonstrating temperature <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion of 60 microkelvin at 300-hertz <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">bandwidth</span></strong>. These results open the door to high-performance ultra<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive resonators in gaseous or liquid environments, single-cell nanocalorimetry, nanoscale gas chromatography, atmospheric-pressure nanoscale mass spectrometry, and new approaches in crystal oscillator <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity.</p>

Flexible strategies for flight control: an active role for the abdomen
<p>Moving animals orchestrate myriad motor systems in response to multimodal sensory inputs. Coordinating movement is particularly challenging in flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, where animals deal with potential in<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity and multiple degrees of freedom of movement. Prior studies have focused on wings as the primary flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> structures, for which changes in angle of attack or shape are used to modulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lift</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drag</span></strong> forces. However, other actuators that may impact flight performance are reflexively activated during flight. We investigated the visual–abdominal reflex displayed by the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i> to determine its role in flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. We measured the open-loop stimulus–response <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">characterist</span></strong>ics (measured as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer funct</span></strong>ion) between the visual stimulus and abdominal response in tethered moths. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">transfer funct</span></strong>ion reveals a 41 ms delay and a high-pass filter behavior with a pass band starting at ~0.5 Hz. We also developed a simplified mathematical model of hovering flight wherein articulation of the thoracic–abdominal joint redirects an average <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lift</span></strong> force provided by the wings. We show that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the joint, subject to a high-pass filter, is sufficient to maintain stable hovering, but with a slim <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity margin. Our experiments and models suggest a novel mechanism by which articulation of the body or ‘airframe’ of an animal can be used to redirect <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">lift</span></strong> forces for effective flight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. Furthermore, the small <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity margin may increase flight agility by easing the transition from stable flight to a more maneuverable, unstable regime.</p>

Drag, but not buoyancy, affects swim speed in captive Steller sea lions
<p>Swimming at an optimal speed is critical for breath-hold divers seeking to maximize the time they can spend foraging underwater. Theoretical studies have predicted that the optimal swim speed for an animal while transiting to and from depth is independent of buoyancy, but is dependent on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drag</span></strong> and metabolic rate. However, this prediction has never been experimentally tested. Our study assessed the effects of buoyancy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drag</span></strong> on the swim speed of three captive Steller sea lions (<i>Eumetopias jubatus</i>) that made 186 dives. Our study animals were trained to dive to feed at fixed depths (10–50 m) under artificially <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led buoyancy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drag</span></strong> conditions. Buoyancy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drag</span></strong> were manipulated using a pair of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes attached to harnesses worn by the sea lions, and buoyancy conditions were designed to fall within the natural range of wild animals (∼12–26% subcutaneous fat). <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drag</span></strong> conditions were changed with and without the PVC tubes, and swim speeds were recorded and compared during descent and ascent phases using an accelerometer attached to the harnesses. Generalized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> mixed-effect models with the animal as the random variable and five explanatory variables (body mass, buoyancy, dive depth, dive phase, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drag</span></strong>) showed that swim speed was best predicted by two variables, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drag</span></strong> and dive phase (AIC = −139). Consistent with a previous theoretical prediction, the results of our study suggest that the optimal swim speed of Steller sea lions is a function of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">drag</span></strong>, and is independent of dive depth and buoyancy.</p>

From oncogenic mutation to dynamic code
<p>Signal transduction pathways (STPs) convert biochemical reactions into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>e and reproducible biological outcomes. These functions are performed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">reliabl</span></strong>y and reproducibly against a background of noise (variation) arising from the stochastic nature of biochemical reactions (<i>1</i>). Indeed, information theory analysis of STPs indicates that they have a limited capacity to discriminate information, including different ligands or different activation states of components (<i>2</i>). However, this discrimination is dramatically enhanced by adding <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic information, such as signal rise time, signal duration, amplitude, and decay rate (<i>3</i>). The observation that differential activation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway can determine whether rat pheochromocytoma cells proliferate or differentiate was reported more than 20 years ago (<i>4</i>), and evidence has since accumulated that STP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> cell fate decisions. However, we are still struggling to understand how signaling <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics is encoded and decoded and how pathological changes, such as the expression of mutant proteins, affect the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic STP code. On page 892 of this issue, Bugaj <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) make use of new tools with which to decipher this code and reveal how certain cancer-associated BRAF mutations can corrupt the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic STP code and trick cells into unlicensed proliferation.</p>

Quantum sensing with arbitrary frequency resolution

miR-183 cluster scales mechanical pain sensitivity by regulating basal and neuropathic pain genes
<p>Nociception is protective and prevents tissue damage but can also facilitate chronic pain. Whether a general principle governs these two types of pain is unknown. Here, we show that both basal mechanical and neuropathic pain are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by the microRNA-183 (miR-183) cluster in mice. This single cluster <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s more than 80% of neuropathic pain–regulated genes and scales basal mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and mechanical allodynia by regulating auxiliary voltage-gated calcium channel subunits α2δ-1 and α2δ-2. Basal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led in nociceptors, and allodynia involves TrkB<sup>+</sup> light-touch mechanoreceptors. These light-touch–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive neurons, which normally do not elicit pain, produce pain during neuropathy that is reversed by gabapentin. Thus, a single microRNA cluster continuously scales acute noxious mechanical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity in nociceptive neurons and suppresses neuropathic pain transduction in a specific, light-touch–<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive neuronal type recruited during mechanical allodynia.</p>

Submillihertz magnetic spectroscopy performed with a nanoscale quantum sensor
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>e timekeeping is critical to metrology, forming the basis by which standards of time, length, and fundamental constants are determined. Stable clocks are particularly valuable in spectroscopy because they define the ultimate frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>ion that can be reached. In quantum metrology, the qubit coherence time defines the clock <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity, from which the spectral linewidth and frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>ion are determined. We demonstrate a quantum sensing protocol in which the spectral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>ion goes beyond the sensor coherence time and is limited by the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity of a classical clock. Using this technique, we observed a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>ion in frequency estimation scaling in time <i>T</i> as <i>T</i><sup>–3/2</sup> for classical oscillating fields. The narrow linewidth magnetometer based on single spins in diamond is used to sense nanoscale magnetic fields with an intrinsic frequency <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion of 607 microhertz, which is eight orders of magnitude narrower than the qubit coherence time.</p>

The Microtubule-Associated Protein IQ67 DOMAIN5 Modulates Microtubule Dynamics and Pavement Cell Shape
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic arrangement of cortical microtubules (MTs) plays a pivotal role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling cell growth and shape formation in plants, but the mechanisms by which cortical MTs are organized to regulate these processes are not well characterized.

In this study, we used the puzzle piece-shaped pavement cells of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves as a model system in which to study cortical MT organization. We isolated an ethyl methanesulfonate mutant with reduced interdigitation of pavement cells in cotyledons. This line carried a mutation in <i>IQ67 DOMAIN5</i> (<i>IQD5</i>), which encodes a member of the plant-specific IQ motif protein family. Live-cell imaging and biochemical analyses demonstrated that IQD5 binds to MTs and promotes MT assembly. MT-depolymerizing drug treatment and in vivo MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics assays suggested that IQD5 functions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ize MTs. Hence, our findings provide genetic, cell biological, and biochemical evidence that IQD5 regulates MT <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics that affect MT organization and subsequent cell shape formation.</p>

Fasting Versus Nonfasting and Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Accuracy
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Recent recommendations favoring nonfasting lipid assessment may affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) estimation. The novel method of LDL-C estimation (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>) uses a flexible approach to derive patient-specific ratios of triglycerides to very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This adaptability may confer an accuracy advantage in nonfasting patients over the fixed approach of the classic Friedewald method (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used a US cross-sectional sample of 1 545  634 patients (959 153 fasting ≥10–12 hours; 586 481 nonfasting) from the second harvest of the Very Large Database of Lipids study to assess for the first time the impact of fasting status on novel LDL-C accuracy. Rapid ultracentrifugation was used to directly measure LDL-C content (LDL-C<sub>D</sub>). Accuracy was defined as the percentage of LDL-C<sub>D</sub> falling within an estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) category by clinical cut points. For low estimated LDL-C (<70 mg/dL), we evaluated accuracy by triglyceride levels. The magnitude of absolute and percent differences between LDL-C<sub>D</sub> and estimated LDL-C (LDL-C<sub>N</sub> or LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) was stratified by LDL-C and triglyceride categories.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In both fasting and nonfasting samples, accuracy was higher with the novel method across all clinical LDL-C categories (range, 87%–94%) compared with the Friedewald estimation (range, 71%–93%; <i>P</i>≤0.001). With LDL-C <70 mg/dL, nonfasting LDL-C<sub>N</sub> accuracy (92%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> accuracy (71%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this LDL-C range, 19% of fasting and 30% of nonfasting patients had differences ≥10 mg/dL between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub>, whereas only 2% and 3% of patients, respectively, had similar differences with novel estimation. Accuracy of LDL-C <70 mg/dL further decreased as triglycerides increased, particularly for Friedewald estimation (range, 37%–96%) versus the novel method (range, 82%–94%). With triglycerides of 200 to 399 mg/dL in nonfasting patients, LDL-C<sub>N</sub> <70 mg/dL accuracy (82%) was superior to LDL-C<sub>F</sub> (37%; <i>P</i><0.001). In this triglyceride range, 73% of fasting and 81% of nonfasting patients had ≥10 mg/dL differences between LDL-C<sub>F</sub> and LDL-C<sub>D</sub> compared with 25% and 20% of patients, respectively, with LDL-C<sub>N</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Novel adaptable LDL-C estimation performs better in nonfasting samples than the fixed Friedewald estimation, with a particular accuracy advantage in settings of low LDL-C and high triglycerides.

MerTK signaling in macrophages promotes the synthesis of inflammation resolution mediators by suppressing CaMKII activity
<p>Inflammation <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion counterbalances excessive inflammation and restores tissue homeostasis after injury. Failure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion contributes to the pathology of numerous chronic inflammatory diseases. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion is mediated by endogenous specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs), which are derived from long-chain fatty acids by lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. 5-LOX plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of two classes of SPMs: lipoxins and resolvins. Cytoplasmic localization of the nonphosphorylated form of 5-LOX is essential for SPM biosynthesis, whereas nuclear localization of phosphorylated 5-LOX promotes proinflammatory leukotriene production. We previously showed that MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor on macrophages, promotes SPM biosynthesis by increasing the abundance of nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic 5-LOX. We now show that activation of MerTK in human macrophages led to ERK-mediated expression of the gene encoding sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2), which decreased the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and suppressed the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This, in turn, reduced the activities of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and the kinase MK2, resulting in the increased abundance of the nonphosphorylated, cytoplasmic form of 5-LOX and enhanced SPM biosynthesis. In a zymosan-induced peritonitis model, an inflammatory setting in which macrophage MerTK activation promotes <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, inhibition of ERK activation delayed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion, which was characterized by an increased number of neutrophils and decreased amounts of SPMs in tissue exudates.

Suppressing relaxation in superconducting qubits by quasiparticle pumping
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ical <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> suppression techniques are commonly used to improve coherence in quantum systems. They reduce dephasing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s by applying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> pulses designed to reverse erroneous coherent evolution driven by environmental noise. However, such methods cannot correct for irreversible processes such as energy relaxation. We investigate a complementary, stochastic approach to reducing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s: Instead of deterministically reversing the unwanted qubit evolution, we use <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> pulses to shape the noise environment <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically. In the context of superconducting qubits, we implement a pumping sequence to reduce the number of unpaired electrons (quasiparticles) in close proximity to the device. A 70% reduction in the quasiparticle density results in a threefold enhancement in qubit relaxation times and a comparable reduction in coherence variability.</p>

<p>The cytoskeletal Filamenting temperature-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive Z (FtsZ) ring is critical for cell division in bacteria and chloroplast division in photosynthetic eukaryotes. While bacterial FtsZ rings are composed of a single FtsZ, except in the basal glaucophytes, chloroplast division involves two heteropolymer-forming FtsZ isoforms: FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 in the green lineage and FtsZA and FtsZB in red algae. FtsZ1 and FtsZB probably arose by duplication of the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively. We expressed fluorescent fusions of FtsZ from diverse photosynthetic organisms in a heterologous system to compare their intrinsic assembly and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong></span></strong>es. FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments were morphologically distinct from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments. When coexpressed, FtsZ pairs from plants and algae colocalized, consistent with heteropolymerization. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments demonstrated that subunit exchange was greater from FtsZ1 and FtsZB filaments than from FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments and that FtsZ1 and FtsZB increased turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, respectively, from heteropolymers. GTPase activity was essential only for turnover of FtsZ2 and FtsZA filaments. Cyanobacterial and glaucophyte FtsZ <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es mostly resembled those of FtsZ2 and FtsZA, though the glaucophyte protein exhibited some hybrid features. Our results demonstrate that the more ancestral FtsZ2 and FtsZA have retained functional attributes of their common FtsZ ancestor, while eukaryotic-specific FtsZ1 and FtsZB acquired new but similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen"><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong></span></strong>es, possibly through convergent evolution. Our findings suggest that the evolution of a second FtsZ that could copolymerize with the more ancestral form to enhance FtsZ-ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics may have been essential for plastid evolution in the green and red photosynthetic lineages.</p>

In lung specimens from autopsy (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, HF-PH, and 7 PVOD) or surgery (10 PVOD), quantitative histomorphometry was performed in all analyzable arteries (n=4949), veins (n=7630), and small indeterminate vessels (IV; n=2168) to define percent medial thickness (arteries) and percent intimal thickness (%IT) (arteries, veins, and IV) relative to external diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The average arterial percent medial thickness (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 6.9; HF-PH, 11.0; PVOD, 15.0), arterial %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 4.9; HF-PH, 14.9; PVOD, 31.1), venous %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 14.0; HF-PH, 24.9; PVOD, 43.9), and IV %IT (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>, 10.6; HF-PH, 25.8; PVOD, 50.0) in HF-PH were higher than <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s (<i>P</i><0.0001 for all) but lower than PVOD (<i>P</i>≤0.005 for all). PASP (mm Hg) was lower in HF-PH (median, 59 [interquartile range, 50–70]) than in PVOD (median, 91 [interquartile range, 82–103]).

Associations between PASP and venous or IV %IT remained significant after adjusting for arterial percent medial thickness and %IT and did not vary by HF type. In patients with right heart catheterization (30 HF-PH, 14 PVOD), similar associations between the transpulmonary gradient and pulmonary vascular remodeling existed, with numerically stronger associations for venous and IV %IT.

Limited acclimation in leaf anatomy to experimental drought in tropical rainforest trees
<p>Dry periods are predicted to become more frequent and severe in the future in some parts of the tropics, including Amazonia, potentially causing reduced productivity, higher tree mortality and increased emissions of stored carbon. Using a long-term (12 year) through-fall exclusion (TFE) experiment in the tropics, we test the hypothesis that trees produce leaves adapted to cope with higher levels of water stress, by examining the following leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">characterist</span></strong>ics: area, thickness, leaf mass per area, vein density, stomatal density, the thickness of palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and both of the epidermal layers, internal cavity volume and the average cell sizes of the palisade and spongy mesophyll. We also test whether differences in leaf anatomy are consistent with observed differential drought-induced mortality responses among taxa, and look for relationships between leaf anatomy, and leaf water relations and gas exchange parameters. Our data show that trees do not produce leaves that are more xeromorphic in response to 12 years of soil moisture deficit. However, the drought treatment did result in increases in the thickness of the adaxial epidermis (TFE: 20.5 ± 1.5 µm, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>: 16.7 ± 1.0 µm) and the internal cavity volume (TFE: 2.43 ± 0.50 mm<sup>3</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>: 1.77 ± 0.30 mm<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>). No consistent differences were detected between drought-resistant and drought-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive taxa, although interactions occurred between drought-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity status and drought treatment for the palisade mesophyll thickness (<i>P</i> = 0.034) and the cavity volume of the leaves (<i>P</i> = 0.025). The limited response to water deficit probably reflects a tight co-ordination between leaf morphology, water relations and photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es. This suggests that there is little plasticity in these aspects of plant anatomy in these taxa, and that phenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may not facilitate the acclimation of Amazonian trees to the predicted future reductions in dry season water availability.</p>

IL-17 integrates multiple self-reinforcing, feed-forward mechanisms through the RNA binding protein Arid5a
<p>Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) not only stimulates immunity to fungal pathogens but also contributes to autoimmune pathology. IL-17 is only a modest activator of transcription in experimental tissue culture settings. However, IL-17 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s posttranscriptional events that enhance the expression of target mRNAs. Here, we showed that the RNA binding protein (RBP) Arid5a (AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 5a) integrated multiple IL-17–driven signaling pathways through posttranscriptional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of mRNA. IL-17 induced expression of Arid5a, which was recruited to the adaptor TRAF2. Arid5a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized IL-17–induced cytokine transcripts by binding to their 3′ untranslated regions and also counteracted mRNA degradation mediated by the endoribonuclease MCPIP1 (Regnase-1). Arid5a inducibly associated with the eukaryotic translation initiation complex and facilitated the translation of the transcription factors (TFs) IκBζ (<i>Nfkbiz</i> ) and C/EBPβ (<i>Cebpb</i>). These TFs in turn transactivated IL-17–dependent promoters. Together, these data indicated that Arid5a orchestrates a feed-forward <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplif</span></strong>ication loop, which promoted IL-17 signaling by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling mRNA <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity and translation.</p>

Exotic states in a simple network of nanoelectromechanical oscillators
<p>Synchronization of oscillators, a phenomenon found in a wide variety of natural and engineered systems, is typically understood through a reduction to a first-order phase model with simplified <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics. Here, by exploiting the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>ion and flexibility of nanoelectromechanical systems, we examined the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of a ring of quasi-sinusoidal oscillators at and beyond first order. Beyond first order, we found exotic states of synchronization with highly complex <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, including weak chimeras, decoupled states, traveling waves, and inhomogeneous synchronized states. Through theory and experiment, we show that these exotic states rely on complex interactions emerging out of networks with simple <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> nearest-neighbor coupling. This work provides insight into the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ical richness of complex systems with weak non<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong>ities and local interactions.</p>

Metropolitan versus small-town influenza
<p>Every year, influenza epidemics occur during winter in regions with temperate climates. The duration, size, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>e timing of influenza epidemics vary from season to season—the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths can be substantial. The influenza epidemic in the winter of 2017–2018 in the United States was extraordinarily severe and long, straining the health care system capacity. Various external factors have been proposed to explain the duration, size, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>e timing of seasonal influenza epidemics, including weakened immune systems during winter, increased social crowding indoors, school leave during the Christmas holiday, and the lower humidity in winter. Inferring the relative importance of each of those factors is difficult because they act on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic process that responds <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ively to changes and that is only observable with a measure of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> (<i>1</i>–<i>4</i>). How can we determine what is driving influenza epidemics? On page 75 of this issue, Dalziel <i>et al.</i> (<i>5</i>) demonstrate how influenza epidemics in a city are driven by fluctuations in humidity, modulated by the population size. This implies that influenza <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> measures could work differently in large metropolitan areas compared to small towns.</p>

Twistable electronics with dynamically rotatable heterostructures

Fault-tolerant detection of a quantum error
<p>A critical component of any quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>–correcting scheme is detection of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s by using an ancilla system. However, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s occurring in the ancilla can propagate onto the logical qubit, irreversibly corrupting the encoded information. We demonstrate a fault-tolerant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>-detection scheme that suppresses spreading of ancilla <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong>s by a factor of 5, while maintaining the assignment fidelity. The same method is used to prevent propagation of ancilla excitations, increasing the logical qubit dephasing time by an order of magnitude. Our approach is hardware-efficient, as it uses a single multilevel transmon ancilla and a cavity-encoded logical qubit, whose interaction is engineered in situ by using an off-resonant sideband drive. The results demonstrate that hardware-efficient approaches that exploit system-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">error</span></strong> models can yield advances toward fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p>

Global analysis of protein folding using massively parallel design, synthesis, and testing
<p>Proteins fold into unique native structures <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ized by thousands of weak interactions that collectively overcome the entropic cost of folding. Although these forces are “encoded” in the thousands of known protein structures, “decoding” them is challenging because of the complexity of natural proteins that have evolved for function, not <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity. We combined computational protein design, next-generation gene synthesis, and a high-throughput protease susceptibility assay to measure folding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity for more than 15,000 de novo designed miniproteins, 1000 natural proteins, 10,000 point mutants, and 30,000 negative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> sequences. This analysis identified more than 2500 stable designed proteins in four basic folds—a number sufficient to enable us to systematically examine how sequence determines folding and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity in uncharted protein space. Iteration between design and experiment increased the design success rate from 6% to 47%, produced stable proteins unlike those found in nature for topologies where design was initially unsuccessful, and revealed subtle contributions to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity as designs became increasingly optimized. Our approach achieves the long-standing goal of a tight feedback cycle between computation and experiment and has the potential to transform computational protein design into a data-driven science.</p>

Decoding of position in the developing neural tube from antiparallel morphogen gradients

<p>Single-cell genomics is important for biology and medicine.

We also show that the predominant cytosine-to-thymine mutations observed in single-cell genomics often arise from the artifact of cytosine deamination upon cell lysis. However, identifying single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) can be accomplished by sequencing kindred cells. We determined the spectrum of SNVs in a single human cell after ultraviolet radiation, revealing their nonrandom genome-wide distribution.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Critical Role of Sodium Flux via the Plasma Membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> Exchanger SOS1 in the Salt Tolerance of Rice
<p>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) stands among the world's most important crop species. Rice is salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive, and the undue accumulation of sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) in shoots has the strongest negative correlation with rice productivity under long-term salinity. The plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger protein Salt Overly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive 1 (SOS1) is the sole Na<sup>+</sup> efflux transporter that has been genetically characterized to date. Here, the importance of SOS1-facilitated Na<sup>+</sup> flux in the salt tolerance of rice was analyzed in a reverse-genetics approach. A <i>sos1</i> loss-of-function mutant displayed exceptional salt <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity that was correlated with excessive Na<sup>+</sup> intake and impaired Na<sup>+</sup> loading into the xylem, thus indicating that SOS1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>s net root Na<sup>+</sup> uptake and long-distance Na<sup>+</sup> transport to shoots. The acute Na<sup>+</sup> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of <i>sos1</i> plants at low NaCl concentrations allowed analysis of the transcriptional response to sodicity stress without effects of the osmotic stress intrinsic to high-salinity treatments. In contrast with that in the wild type, <i>sos1</i> mutant roots displayed preferential down-regulation of stress-related genes in response to salt treatment, despite the greater intensity of stress experienced by the mutant. These results suggest there is impaired stress detection or an inability to mount a comprehensive response to salinity in <i>sos1</i>. In summary, the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger SOS1 plays a major role in the salt tolerance of rice by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and possibly contributing to the sensing of sodicity stress.</p>

Low Water Potential and At14a-Like1 (AFL1) Effects on Endocytosis and Actin Filament Organization
<p>At14a-Like1 (AFL1) is a stress-induced protein of unknown function that promotes growth during low water potential stress and drought. Previous analysis indicated that AFL1 may have functions related to endocytosis and regulation of actin filament organization, processes for which the effects of low water potential are little known. We found that low water potential led to a decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the membrane-impermeable dye FM4-64. Ectopic expression of AFL1 reversed the decrease in FM4-64 uptake seen in wild type, while reduced AFL1 expression led to further inhibition of FM4-64 uptake. Increased AFL1 also made FM4-64 uptake less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive to the actin filament disruptor Latrunculin B (LatB). LatB decreased AFL1-Clathrin Light Chain colocalization, further indicating that effects of AFL1 on endocytosis may be related to actin filament organization or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic AFL1 expression made actin filaments less <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive to disruption by LatB or Cytochalasin D and led to increased actin filament skewness and decreased occupancy, indicative of more bundled actin filaments. This latter effect could be partially mimicked by the actin filament <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>izer Jasplakinolide (JASP). However, AFL1 did not substantially inhibit actin filament <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics, indicating that AFL1 acts via a different mechanism than JASP-induced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ization. AFL1 partially colocalized with actin filaments but not with microtubules, further indicating actin-filament–related function of AFL1. These data provide insight into endocytosis and actin filament responses to low water potential stress and demonstrate an involvement of AFL1 in these key cellular processes.</p>

Genetic Dissection of Fe-Dependent Signaling in Root Developmental Responses to Phosphate Deficiency
<p>The inhibition of primary root (PR) growth is a major developmental response of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. Previous studies have independently uncovered key roles of the LOW PHOSPHATE RESPONSE1 (LPR1) ferroxidase, the tonoplast-localized ALUMINUM SENSITIVE3 (ALS3)/SENSITIVE TO ALUMINUM RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STAR1) transporter complex, and the SENSITIVE TO PROTON RHIZOTOXICITY1 (STOP1; a transcription factor)-ALUMINUM-ACTIVATED MALATE TRANSPORTER1 (ALMT1; a malate transporter) regulatory module in mediating this response by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling iron (Fe) homeostasis in roots, but how these three components interact to regulate PR growth under Pi deficiency remains unknown. Here, we dissected genetic relationships among these three key components and found that (1) STOP1, ALMT1, and LPR1 act downstream of ALS3/STAR1 in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>ling PR growth under Pi deficiency; (2) ALS3/STAR1 inhibits the STOP1-ALMT1 pathway by repressing STOP1 protein accumulation in the nucleus; and (3) STOP1-ALMT1 and LPR1 <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> PR growth under Pi deficiency in an interdependent manner involving the promotion of malate-dependent Fe accumulation in roots. Furthermore, this malate-mediated Fe accumulation depends on external Pi availability. We also performed a detailed analysis of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic changes in the tissue-specific Fe accumulation patterns in the root tips of plants exposed to Pi deficiency. The results indicate that the degree of inhibition of PR growth induced by Pi deficiency is not linked to the level of Fe accumulated in the root apical meristem or the elongation zone. Our work provides insights into the molecular mechanism that regulates the root developmental response to Pi deficiency.</p>

Overexpression of RING Domain E3 Ligase ZmXerico1 Confers Drought Tolerance through Regulation of ABA Homeostasis
<p>Drought stress is one of the main environmental problems encountered by crop growers. Reduction in arable land area and reduced water availability make it paramount to identify and develop strategies to allow crops to be more resilient in water-limiting environments. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in the plants’ response to drought stress through its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of stomatal aperture and water transpiration, and transgenic modulation of ABA levels therefore represents an attractive avenue to improve the drought tolerance of crops. Several steps in the ABA-signaling pathway are <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led by ubiquitination involving really interesting new genes (RING) domain-containing proteins. We characterized the maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) RING protein family and identified two novel RING-H2 genes called <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i>. Expression of <i>ZmXerico</i> genes is induced by drought stress, and we show that overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in Arabidopsis and maize confers ABA hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and improved water use efficiency, which can lead to enhanced maize yield performance in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led drought-stress environment. Overexpression of <i>ZmXerico1</i> and <i>ZmXerico2</i> in maize results in increased ABA levels and decreased levels of ABA degradation products diphaseic acid and phaseic acid. We show that ZmXerico1 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, where ABA 8′-hydroxylases have been shown to be localized, and that it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We demonstrate that ZmXerico1 plays a role in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of ABA homeostasis through regulation of ABA 8′-hydroxylase protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">stabil</span></strong>ity, representing a novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> point in the regulation of the ABA pathway.</p>

A Dynamic Hydro-Mechanical and Biochemical Model of Stomatal Conductance for C<sub>4</sub> Photosynthesis
<p>C<sub>4</sub> plants are major grain (maize [<i>Zea mays</i>] and sorghum [<i>Sorghum bicolor</i>]), sugar (sugarcane [<i>Saccharum officinarum</i>]), and biofuel (<i>Miscanthus</i> spp.) producers and contribute ∼20% to global productivity. Plants lose water through stomatal pores in order to acquire CO<sub>2</sub> (assimilation [<i>A</i>]) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> their carbon-for-water balance by regulating stomatal conductance (<i>g</i><sub>S</sub>). The ability to mechanistically predict <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> and <i>A</i> in response to atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, water availability, and time is critical for simulating stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of plant-atmospheric carbon and water exchange under current, past, or future environmental conditions. Yet, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic mechanistic models for <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> are lacking, especially for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. We developed and coupled a hydromechanical model of stomatal behavior with a biochemical model of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis, calibrated using gas-exchange measurements in maize, and extended the coupled model with time-explicit functions to predict <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic responses. We demonstrated the wider applicability of the model with three additional C<sub>4</sub> grass species in which interspecific differences in stomatal behavior could be accounted for by fitting a single parameter. The model accurately predicted steady-state responses of <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> to light, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen, soil drying, and evaporative demand as well as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic responses to light intensity. Further analyses suggest that the effect of variable leaf hydraulic conductance is negligible. Based on the model, we derived a set of equations suitable for incorporation in land surface models. Our model illuminates the processes underpinning stomatal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> in C<sub>4</sub> plants and suggests that the hydraulic benefits associated with fast stomatal responses of C<sub>4</sub> grasses may have supported the evolution of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis.</p>

Baseline hearing abilities and variability in wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>)
<p>While hearing is the primary sensory modality for odontocetes, there are few data addressing variation within a natural population. This work describes the hearing ranges (4–150 kHz) and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivities of seven apparently healthy, wild beluga whales (<i>Delphinapterus leucas</i>) during a population health assessment project that captured and released belugas in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The baseline hearing abilities and subsequent variations were addressed. Hearing was measured using auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). All audiograms showed a typical cetacean U-shape; substantial variation (>30 dB) was found between most and least <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive thresholds. All animals heard well, up to at least 128 kHz. Two heard up to 150 kHz. Lowest auditory thresholds (35–45 dB) were identified in the range 45–80 kHz. Greatest differences in hearing abilities occurred at both the high end of the auditory range and at frequencies of maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity. In general, wild beluga hearing was quite <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive. Hearing abilities were similar to those of belugas measured in zoological settings, reinforcing the comparative importance of both settings. The relative degree of variability across the wild belugas suggests that audiograms from multiple individuals are needed to properly describe the maximum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity and population variance for odontocetes. Hearing measures were easily incorporated into field-based settings. This detailed examination of hearing abilities in wild Bristol Bay belugas provides a basis for a better understanding of the potential impact of anthropogenic noise on a noise-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ive species. Such information may help design noise-limiting mitigation measures that could be applied to areas heavily influenced and inhabited by endangered belugas.</p>

Biomimetic shark skin: design, fabrication and hydrodynamic function
<p>Although the functional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of shark skin have been of considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the complex hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows detailed study of hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic function. We present the first study of the design, fabrication and hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic testing of a synthetic, flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the shortfin mako (<i>Isurus oxyrinchus</i>). Using 3D printing, thousands of rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>led, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong>-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex with greater vorticity than the smooth <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> was generated by the 3D printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the ability to examine the hydro<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic consequences of diverse skin denticle shapes present in different shark species.</p>

<sec><title>Aims</title><p>α-defensin is a biomarker which has been described as having   a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint   infection (PJI). Current meta-analyses are based on the α-defensin   laboratory-based immunoassay rather than the quick on-table lateral   flow test kit. This study is the first meta-analysis to compare the   accuracy of the α-defensin laboratory-based immunoassay and the   lateral flow test kit for the diagnosis of PJI.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.   Inclusion criteria were all clinical studies where the diagnosis   of PJI was uncertain. All studies selected used the Musculoskeletal   Infection Society (MSIS) or modified MSIS criteria. Two independent   reviewers reviewed the studies and extracted data. A meta-analysis   of results was carried out: pooled <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity, specificity, positive   and negative likelihood ratio, heterogeneity and areas under curves   are reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ten studies (759 patients) were included.

Large Cardiac Muscle Patches Engineered From Human Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cell–Derived Cardiac Cells Improve Recovery From Myocardial Infarction in Swine
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Here, we generated human cardiac muscle patches (hCMPs) of clinically relevant dimensions (4 cm × 2 cm × 1.25 mm) by suspending cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells that had been differentiated from human induced-pluripotent stem cells in a fibrin scaffold and then culturing the construct on a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic (rocking) platform.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In vitro assessments of hCMPs suggest maturation in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture stimulation. In vivo assessments were conducted in a porcine model of myocardial infarction (MI). Animal groups included: MI hearts treated with 2 hCMPs (MI+hCMP, n=13), MI hearts treated with 2 cell-free open fibrin patches (n=14), or MI hearts with neither experimental patch (n=15); a fourth group of animals underwent sham surgery (Sham, n=8). Cardiac function and infarct size were evaluated by MRI, arrhythmia incidence by implanted loop recorders, and the engraftment rate by calculation of quantitative polymerase chain reaction measurements of expression of the human Y chromosome. Additional studies examined the myocardial protein expression profile changes and potential mechanisms of action that related to exosomes from the cell patch.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The hCMPs began to beat synchronously within 1 day of fabrication, and after 7 days of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture stimulation, in vitro assessments indicated the mechanisms related to the improvements in electronic mechanical coupling, calcium-handling, and force generation, suggesting a maturation process during the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture. The engraftment rate was 10.9±1.8% at 4 weeks after the transplantation. The hCMP transplantation was associated with significant improvements in left ventricular function, infarct size, myocardial wall stress, myocardial hypertrophy, and reduced apoptosis in the periscar boarder zone myocardium. hCMP transplantation also reversed some MI-associated changes in sarcomeric regulatory protein phosphorylation. The exosomes released from the hCMP appeared to have cytoprotective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es that improved cardiomyocyte survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We have fabricated a clinically relevant size of hCMP with trilineage cardiac cells derived from human induced-pluripotent stem cells. The hCMP matures in vitro during 7 days of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic culture. Transplantation of this type of hCMP results in significantly reduced infarct size and improvements in cardiac function that are associated with reduction in left ventricular wall stress. The hCMP treatment is not associated with significant changes in arrhythmogenicity.</p></sec>

Effect of Ferric Carboxymaltose on Exercise Capacity in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure and Iron Deficiency
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Iron deficiency is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and is associated with reduced exercise capacity and poor outcomes.

Direct Comparison of 4 Very Early Rule-Out Strategies for Acute Myocardial Infarction Using High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Four strategies for very early rule-out of acute myocardial infarction using high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) have been identified. It remains unclear which strategy is most attractive for clinical application.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We prospectively enrolled unselected patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. The final diagnosis was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists. Hs-cTnI levels were measured at presentation and after 1 hour in a blinded fashion. We directly compared all 4 hs-cTnI–based rule-out strategies: limit of detection (LOD, hs-cTnI<2 ng/L), single cutoff (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L), 1-hour algorithm (hs-cTnI<5 ng/L and 1-hour change<2 ng/L), and the 0/1-hour algorithm recommended in the European Society of Cardiology guideline combining LOD and 1-hour algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Among 2828 enrolled patients, acute myocardial infarction was the final diagnosis in 451 (16%) patients. The LOD approach ruled out 453 patients (16%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 99.2%–100%), the single cutoff 1516 patients (54%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of 97.1% (95% CI, 95.1%–98.3%), the 1-hour algorithm 1459 patients (52%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%), and the 0/1-hour algorithm 1463 patients (52%) with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of 98.4% (95% CI, 96.8%–99.2%). Predefined subgroup analysis in early presenters (≤2 hours) revealed significantly lower <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity (94.2%, interaction <i>P</i>=0.03) of the single cutoff, but not the other strategies. Two-year survival was 100% with LOD and 98.1% with the other strategies (<i>P</i><0.01 for LOD versus each of the other strategies).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>All 4 rule-out strategies balance effectiveness and safety equally well. The single cutoff should not be applied in early presenters, whereas the 3 other strategies seem to perform well in this challenging subgroup.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration:</title><p>URL: <ext-link>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.

PGR5-Dependent Cyclic Electron Flow Protects Photosystem I under Fluctuating Light at Donor and Acceptor Sides
<p>In response to a sudden increase in light intensity, plants must cope with absorbed excess photon energy to protect photosystems from photodamage. Under fluctuating light, PSI is severely photodamaged in the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) <i>proton gradient regulation5</i> (<i>pgr5</i>) mutant defective in the main pathway of PSI cyclic electron transport (CET). Here, we aimed to determine how PSI is protected by two proposed regulatory roles of CET via transthylakoid ΔpH formation: (1) reservation of electron sink capacity by adjusting the ATP/NADPH production ratio (acceptor-side regulation) and (2) down-regulation of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex activity called photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> for slowing down the electron flow toward PSI (donor-side regulation). We artificially enhanced donor- and acceptor-side regulation in the wild-type and <i>pgr5</i> backgrounds by introducing the <i>pgr1</i> mutation conferring the hyper<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of the cytochrome <i>b</i><sub>6</sub><i>f</i> complex to luminal acidification and moss <i>Physcomitrella patens</i> flavodiiron protein genes, respectively. Enhanced photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> partially alleviated PSI photodamage in the <i>pgr5</i> mutant background but restricted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">linear</span></strong> electron transport under constant high light, suggesting that the strength of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> should be optimized. Flavodiiron protein-dependent oxygen photoreduction formed a large electron sink and alleviated PSI photoinhibition, accompanied by the induction of photosynthetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>. Thus, donor-side regulation is essential for PSI photoprotection but acceptor-side regulation also is important to rapidly induce donor-side regulation. In angiosperms, PGR5-dependent CET is required for both functions.</p>

The Causes of Leaf Hydraulic Vulnerability and Its Influence on Gas Exchange in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>The influence of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of leaf hydraulic conductance (<i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub>) diurnally and during dehydration on stomatal conductance and photosynthesis remains unclear. Using the model species Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> ecotype Columbia-0), we applied a multitiered approach including physiological measurements, high-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolut</span></strong>ion x-ray microcomputed tomography, and modeling at a range of scales to characterize (1) <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> decline during dehydration; (2) its basis in the hydraulic conductances of leaf xylem and outside-xylem pathways (<i>K</i><sub>ox</sub>); (3) the dependence of its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics on irradiance; (4) its impact on diurnal patterns of stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate; and (5) its influence on gas exchange and survival under simulated drought regimes. Arabidopsis leaves showed strong vulnerability to dehydration diurnally in both gas exchange and hydraulic conductance, despite lack of xylem embolism or conduit collapse above the turgor loss point, indicating a pronounced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">sensit</span></strong>ivity of <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> to dehydration. <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> increased under higher irradiance in well-hydrated leaves across the full range of water potential, but no shift in <i>K</i><sub>leaf</sub> vulnerability was observed. Modeling indicated that responses to dehydration and irradiance are likely attributable to changes in membrane permeability and that a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic <i>K</i><sub>ox</sub> would contribute strongly to stomatal closure, improving performance, survival, and efficient water use during drought. These findings for Columbia-0 provide a baseline for assessing variation across genotypes in hydraulic traits and their influence on gas exchange during dehydration.</p>

VIPP1 Involved in Chloroplast Membrane Integrity Has GTPase Activity in Vitro
<p>VESICLE-INDUCING PROTEIN IN PLASTID1 (VIPP1) is conserved among oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and appears to have diverged from the bacterial PspA protein. VIPP1 localizes to the chloroplast envelope and thylakoid membrane, where it forms homooligomers of high molecular mass. Although multiple roles of VIPP1 have been inferred, including thylakoid membrane formation, envelope maintenance, membrane fusion, and regulation of photosynthetic activity, its <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">precis</span></strong>e role in chloroplast membrane quality <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> remains unknown. VIPP1 forms an oligomer through its amino-terminal domain and triggers membrane fusion in an Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. We previously demonstrated that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) VIPP1 also exhibits <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ic complex disassembly in response to osmotic and heat stresses in vivo. These results suggest that VIPP1 mediates membrane fusion/remodeling in chloroplasts. Considering that protein machines that regulate intracellular membrane fusion/remodeling events often require a capacity for GTP binding and/or hydrolysis, we questioned whether VIPP1 has similar <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es. We conducted an in vitro assay using a purified VIPP1-His fusion protein expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells. VIPP1-His showed GTP hydrolysis activity that was inhibited competitively by an unhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTPγS, and that depends on GTP binding. It is particularly interesting that the ancestral PspA from <i>E. coli</i> also possesses GTP hydrolysis activity. Although VIPP1 does not contain a canonical G domain, the amino-terminal α-helix was found to be important for both GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis as well as for oligomer formation. Collectively, our results reveal that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">properti</span></strong>es of VIPP1/PspA are similar to those of GTPases.</p>

A Model of Leaf Coordination to Scale-Up Leaf Expansion from the Organ to the Canopy
<p>Process-based crop growth models are popular tools with which to analyze and understand the impact of crop management, genotype-by-environment interactions, or climate change. The ability to predict leaf area development is critical to predict crop growth, particularly under conditions of limited resources. Here, we aimed at deciphering growth coordination rules between wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i>) plant organs (i.e. between leaves within a stem, between laminae and sheaths, and between the mainstem and axillary tillers) to model the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of canopy development. We found a unique relationship between laminae area and leaf rank for the mainstem and its tillers, which was robust across a range of sowing dates and plant densities. Robust relationships between laminae and sheath areas also were found, highlighting the tight <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of organ growth within and between phytomers. These relationships identified at the phytomer scale were used to develop a simulation model of leaf area <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics at the canopy level that was integrated in the wheat model SiriusQuality. The model was then evaluated using several independent experiments. The model accurately predicts leaf area <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics under different scenarios of nitrogen and water limitations. It accounted for 85%, 64%, and 73% of the variability of the surface area of leaf cohorts, total leaf area index, and total green area index, respectively. The process-based model of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">dynam</span></strong>ics of leaf area described here is a key element to quantify the value of candidate traits for use in plant breeding and to project the impact of climate change on wheat growth.</p>

<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the oscillator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian oscillator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf oscillator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell oscillator is different from the average plant oscillator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell oscillator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Genetic Control of Plasticity in Root Morphology and Anatomy of Rice in Response to Water Deficit
<p>Elucidating the genetic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> of rooting behavior under water-deficit stress is essential to breed climate-robust rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) cultivars. Using a diverse panel of 274 <i>indica</i> genotypes grown under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> and water-deficit conditions during vegetative growth, we phenotyped 35 traits, mostly related to root morphology and anatomy, involving 45,000 root-scanning images and nearly 25,000 cross sections from the root-shoot junction. The phenotypic plasticity of these traits was quantified as the relative change in trait value under water-deficit compared with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> conditions. We then carried out a genome-wide association analysis on these traits and their plasticity, using 45,608 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms. One hundred four significant loci were detected for these traits under <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong> conditions, 106 were detected under water-deficit stress, and 76 were detected for trait plasticity. We predicted 296 (<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">control</span></strong>), 284 (water-deficit stress), and 233 (plasticity) a priori candidate genes within linkage dis<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">equilibrium</span></strong> blocks for these loci. We identified key a priori candidate genes regulating root growth and development and relevant alleles that, upon validation, can help improve rice adaptation to water-deficit stress.</p>

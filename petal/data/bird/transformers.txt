<i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) and the Circadian Control of Stomatal Aperture
<p>The endogenous circadian (∼24 h) system allows plants to anticipate and adapt to daily environmental changes. Stomatal aperture is one of the many processes under circadian control; stomatal opening and closing occurs under constant conditions, even in the absence of environmental cues. To understand the significance of circadian-mediated anticipation in stomatal opening, we have generated <i>SGC</i> (specifically guard cell) Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants in which the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator gene <i>CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1</i> (<i>CCA1</i>) was overexpressed under the control of the guard-cell-specific promoter, <i>GC1.</i> The <i>SGC</i> plants showed a loss of ability to open stomata in anticipation of daily dark-to-light changes and of circadian-mediated stomatal opening in constant light. We observed that under fully watered and mild drought conditions, <i>SGC</i> plants outperform wild type with larger leaf area and biomass. To investigate the molecular basis for circadian control of guard cell aperture, we used large-scale qRT-PCR to compare circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator gene expression in guard cells compared with the “average” whole-leaf <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator and examined gene expression and stomatal aperture in several lines of plants with misexpressed <i>CCA1</i>. Our results show that the guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator is different from the average plant <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. Moreover, the differences in guard cell <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator function may be important for the correct regulation of photoperiod pathway genes that have previously been reported to control stomatal aperture. We conclude by showing that CONSTANS and FLOWERING LOCUS T, components of the photoperiod pathway that regulate flowering time, also control stomatal aperture in a daylength-dependent manner.</p>

Quantum oscillations of electrical resistivity in an insulator
<p>In metals, orbital motions of conduction electrons on the Fermi surface are quantized in magnetic fields, which is manifested by quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in electrical resistivity. This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here, we report a notable exception in an insulator—ytterbium dodecaboride (YbB<sub>12</sub>). The resistivity of YbB<sub>12</sub>, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in metals, exhibits distinct quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations. These unconventional <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations arise from the insulating bulk, even though the temperature dependence of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lation amplitude follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of metals with a large effective mass. Quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in the magnetic torque are also observed, albeit with a lighter effective mass.</p>

Spectacular Oscillations in Plant Isoprene Emission under Transient Conditions Explain the Enigmatic CO<sub>2</sub> Response<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Plant isoprene emissions respond to light and temperature similarly to photosynthesis, but CO<sub>2</sub> dependencies of isoprene emission and photosynthesis are profoundly different, with photosynthesis increasing and isoprene emission decreasing with increasing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration due to reasons not yet understood. We studied isoprene emission, net assimilation rate, and chlorophyll fluorescence under different CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the strong isoprene emitter hybrid aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus tremuloides</i>), and used rapid changes in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> concentrations or light level to induce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations. As isoprene-emitting species support very high steady-state chloroplastic pool sizes of the primary isoprene substrate, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP), which can mask the effects of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>latory dynamics on isoprene emission, the size of the DMADP pool was experimentally reduced by either partial inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis pathway by fosmidomycin-feeding or by changes in ambient gas concentrations leading to DMADP pool depletion in intact leaves. In feedback-limited conditions observed at low O<sub>2</sub> and/or high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration under which the rate of photosynthesis is governed by the limited rate of ATP and NADPH formation due to low chloroplastic phosphate levels, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in photosynthesis and isoprene emission were repeatedly induced by rapid environmental modifications in both partly fosmidomycin-inhibited leaves and in intact leaves with in vivo reduced DMADP pools. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in net assimilation rate and isoprene emission in feedback-inhibited leaves were in the same phase, and relative changes in the pools of photosynthetic metabolites and DMADP estimated by in vivo kinetic methods were directly proportional through all <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations induced by different environmental perturbations. We conclude that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in isoprene emission provide direct experimental evidence demonstrating that the response of isoprene emission to changes in ambient gas concentrations is controlled by the chloroplastic reductant supply.</p>

Transcriptome and Degradome Sequencing Reveals Dormancy Mechanisms of <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> Seeds<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Seeds with physiological dormancy usually experience primary and secondary dormancy in the nature; however, little is known about the differential regulation of primary and secondary dormancy. We combined multiple approaches to investigate cytological changes, hormonal levels, and gene expression dynamics in <i>Cunninghamia lanceolata</i> seeds during primary dormancy release and secondary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that protein bodies in the embryo cells coalesced during primary dormancy release and then separated during secondary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion. Transcriptomic profiling demonstrated that expression of genes negatively regulating gibberellic acid (GA) sensitivity reduced specifically during primary dormancy release, whereas the expression of genes positively regulating abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis increased during secondary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion. Parallel analysis of RNA ends revealed uncapped transcripts for ∼55% of all unigenes. A negative correlation between fold changes in expression levels of uncapped versus capped mRNAs was observed during primary dormancy release. However, this correlation was loose during secondary dormancy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion. Our analyses suggest that the reversible changes in cytology and gene expression during dormancy release and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion are related to ABA/GA balance. Moreover, mRNA degradation functions as a critical posttranscriptional regulator during primary dormancy release. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding physiological dormancy in seeds.</p>

Molecular Biology and Evolution
A Photoreceptor Contributes to the Natural Variation of Diapause Induction in <i>Daphnia magna</i>
<p>Diapause is an adaptation that allows organisms to survive harsh environmental conditions. In species occurring over broad habitat ranges, both the timing and the intensity of diapause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion can vary across populations, revealing patterns of local adaptation. Understanding the genetic architecture of this fitness-related trait would help clarify how populations adapt to their local environments. In the cyclical parthenogenetic crustacean <i>Daphnia magna</i>, diapause <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion is a phenotypic plastic life history trait linked to sexual reproduction, as asexual females have the ability to switch to sexual reproduction and produce resting stages, their sole strategy for surviving habitat deterioration. We have previously shown that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of resting stage production correlates with changes in photoperiod that indicate the imminence of habitat deterioration and have identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) responsible for some of the variation in the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of resting stages. Here, new data allows us to anchor the QTL to a large scaffold and then, using a combination of a new mapping panel, targeted association mapping and selection analysis in natural populations, to identify candidate genes within the QTL. Our results show that variation in a rhodopsin photoreceptor gene plays a significant role in the variation observed in resting stage <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion. This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the link between diapause and day-length perception that has been suggested in diverse arthropod taxa.</p>

p53 dynamics in response to DNA damage vary across cell lines and are shaped by efficiency of DNA repair and activity of the kinase ATM
<p>Cellular systems show a wide range of signaling dynamics. Many of these dynamics are highly stereotyped, such as <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations at a fixed frequency. However, most studies looking at the role of signaling dynamics focus on one or a few cell lines, leaving the diversity of dynamics across tissues or cell lines a largely unexplored question. We focused on the dynamics of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which regulates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. We established live-cell reporters for 12 cancer cell lines expressing wild-type p53 and quantified p53 dynamics in response to double-strand break–inducing DNA damage. In many of the tested cell lines, we found that p53 abundance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lated in response to ionizing radiation or the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic neocarzinostatin and that the periodicity of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations was fixed. In other cell lines, p53 abundance dynamically changed in different ways, such as a single broad pulse or a continuous <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion. By combining single-cell assays of p53 signaling dynamics, small-molecule screening in live cells, and mathematical modeling, we identified molecules that perturbed p53 dynamics and determined that cell-specific variation in the efficiency of DNA repair and the activity of the kinase ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) controlled the signaling landscape of p53 dynamics. Because the dynamics of wild-type p53 varied substantially between cell lines, our study highlights the limitation of using one line as a model system and emphasizes the importance of studying the dynamics of other signaling pathways across different cell lines and genetic backgrounds.</p>

Arbitrary spin-to–orbital angular momentum conversion of light
<p>Optical elements that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong> the spin angular momentum (SAM) of light into vortex beams have found applications in classical and quantum optics. These elements—SAM-to–orbital angular momentum (OAM) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong>ers—are based on the geometric phase and only permit the conversion of left- and right-circular polarizations (spin states) into states with opposite OAM. We present a method for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong>ing arbitrary SAM states into total angular momentum states characterized by a superposition of independent OAM. We designed a metasurface that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong>s left- and right-circular polarizations into states with independent values of OAM and designed another device that performs this operation for elliptically polarized states. These results illustrate a general material-mediated connection between SAM and OAM of light and may find applications in producing complex structured light and in optical communication.</p>

Coupling between distant biofilms and emergence of nutrient time-sharing
<p>Bacteria within communities can interact to organize their behavior. It has been unclear whether such interactions can extend beyond a single community to coordinate the behavior of distant populations. We discovered that two <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> biofilm communities undergoing metabolic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations can become coupled through electrical signaling and synchronize their growth dynamics. Coupling increases competition by also synchronizing demand for limited nutrients. As predicted by mathematical modeling, we confirm that biofilms <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolv</span></strong>e this conflict by switching from in-phase to antiphase <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations. This results in time-sharing behavior, where each community takes turns consuming nutrients. Time-sharing enables biofilms to counterintuitively increase growth under reduced nutrient supply. Distant biofilms can thus coordinate their behavior to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolv</span></strong>e nutrient competition through time-sharing, a strategy used in engineered systems to allocate limited resources.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
A Cycloheximide-Sensitive Step in Transverse Microtubule Array Patterning
<p>The growth properties of individual cells within a tissue determine plant morphology, and the organization of the cytoskeleton, particularly the microtubule arrays, determines cellular growth properties. We investigated the mechanisms governing the formation of transverse microtubule array patterns in axially growing Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) epidermal hypocotyl cells. Using quantitative imaging approaches, we mapped the transition of the cortical microtubule arrays into a transverse coaligned pattern after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion with auxin and gibberellic acid. Hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion led to an early loss of microtubule plus end density and a rotation toward oblique patterns. Beginning 30 min after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion, transverse microtubules appeared at the cell’s midzone concurrently with the loss of longitudinal polymers, eventually progressing apically and basally to remodel the array pattern. Based on the timing and known hormone-signaling pathways, we tested the hypothesis that the later events require de novo gene expression and, thus, constitute a level of genetic control over transverse patterning. We found that the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) resulted in a selective and reversible loss of transverse patterns that were replaced with radial-like pinwheel arrays exhibiting a split bipolar architecture centered at the cell’s midzone. Experiments using hormone <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion and CHX revealed that pinwheel arrays occur when transverse microtubules increase at the midzone but longitudinal microtubules in the split bipolar architecture are not suppressed. We propose that a key regulatory mechanism for creating the transverse microtubule coalignment in axially growing hypocotyls involves the expression of a CHX-sensitive factor that acts to suppress the nucleation of the longitudinally oriented polymers.</p>

BIG Regulates Dynamic Adjustment of Circadian Period in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythms with a period near 24 h, but the molecular basis of the regulation of the period of the circadian clockis poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that metabolites affect the free-running period of the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), with endogenous sugars acting as an accelerator and exogenous nicotinamide acting as a brake. Changes in circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator period are thought to adjust the timing of biological activities through the process of entrainment, in which the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator becomes synchronized to rhythmic signals such as light and dark cycles as well as changes in internal metabolism. To identify the molecular components associated with the dynamic adjustment of circadian period, we performed a forward genetic screen. We identified Arabidopsis mutants that were either period insensitive to nicotinamide (<i>sin</i>) or period oversensitive to nicotinamide (<i>son</i>). We mapped <i>son1</i> to <i>BIG</i>, a gene of unknown molecular function that was shown previously to play a role in light signaling. We found that <i>son1</i> has an early entrained phase, suggesting that the dynamic alteration of circadian period contributes to the correct timing of biological events. Our data provide insight into how the dynamic period adjustment of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators contributes to establishing a correct phase relationship with the environment and show that BIG is involved in this process.</p>

Sucrose and Ethylene Signaling Interact to Modulate the Circadian Clock
<p>Circadian clocks drive rhythmic physiology and metabolism to optimize plant growth and performance under daily environmental fluctuations caused by the rotation of the planet. Photosynthesis is a key metabolic process that must be appropriately timed to the light-dark cycle. The circadian clock contributes to the regulation of photosynthesis, and in turn the daily accumulation of sugars from photosynthesis also feeds back to regulate the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. We have previously shown that <i>GIGANTEA</i> (<i>GI</i>) is required to sustain Suc-dependent circadian rhythms in darkness. The mechanism by which Suc affects the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator in a <i>GI</i>-dependent manner was unknown. Here, we identify that Suc sustains rhythms in the dark by stabilizing GI protein, dependent on the F-box protein <i>ZEITLUPE</i>, and implicate <i>CONSTITUTIVE TRIPLE RESPONSE1</i> (<i>CTR1</i>), a negative regulator of ethylene signaling. Our identification of a role for CTR1 in the response to Suc prompted a reinvestigation of the effects of ethylene on the circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator. We demonstrate that ethylene shortens the circadian period, conditional on the effects of Suc and requiring <i>GI</i>. These findings reveal that Suc affects the stability of circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator proteins and can mask the effects of ethylene on the circadian system, identifying novel molecular pathways for input of sugar to the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) circadian network.</p>

Simultaneous high-resolution pH and spectrophotometric recordings of oxygen binding in blood microvolumes
<p>Oxygen equilibrium curves have been widely used to understand oxygen transport in numerous organisms. A major challenge has been to monitor oxygen binding characteristics and concomitant pH changes as they occur <i>in vivo</i>, in limited sample volumes. Here we report a technique allowing highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolv</span></strong>ed and simultaneous monitoring of pH and blood pigment saturation in minute blood volumes. We equipped a gas diffusion chamber with a broad-range fibre-optic spectrophotometer and a micro-pH optode and recorded changes of pigment oxygenation along oxygen partial pressure (<i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub>) and pH gradients to test the setup. Oxygen binding parameters derived from measurements in only 15 μl of haemolymph from the cephalopod <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> showed low instrumental error (0.93%) and good agreement with published data. Broad-range spectra, each <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolv</span></strong>ing 2048 data points, provided detailed insight into the complex absorbance characteristics of diverse blood types. After consideration of photobleaching and intrinsic fluorescence, pH optodes yielded accurate recordings and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolv</span></strong>ed a sigmoidal shift of 0.03 pH units in response to changing <i>P</i><sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> from 0 to 21 kPa. Highly <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolv</span></strong>ed continuous recordings along pH gradients conformed to stepwise measurements at low rates of pH changes. In this study we showed that a diffusion chamber upgraded with a broad-range spectrophotometer and an optical pH sensor accurately characterizes oxygen binding with minimal sample consumption and manipulation. We conclude that the modified diffusion chamber is highly suitable for experimental biologists who demand high flexibility, detailed insight into oxygen binding as well as experimental and biological accuracy combined in a single setup.</p>

Artifactual mutations resulting from DNA lesions limit detection levels in ultrasensitive sequencing applications
<p>The need in cancer research or evolutionary biology to detect rare mutations or variants present at very low frequencies (<10<sup>−5</sup>) poses an increasing demand on lowering the detection limits of available methods. Here we demonstrated that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>able DNA lesions introduce important error sources in ultrasensitive technologies such as single molecule PCR (smPCR) applications (e.g. droplet-digital PCR), or next-generation sequencing (NGS) based methods. Using templates with known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>able lesions (8-oxoguanine, deaminated 5-methylcytosine, uracil, and DNA heteroduplexes), we assessed with smPCR and duplex sequencing that templates with these lesions were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed very efficiently by proofreading polymerases (except uracil), leading to G->T, and to a lesser extent, to unreported G->C substitutions at 8-oxoguanine lesions, and C->T transitions in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed uracil containing templates. Long heat incubations common in many DNA extraction protocols significantly increased the number of G->T substitutions. Moreover, in ∼50-80% smPCR reactions we observed the random <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation preference of only one of both DNA strands explaining the known ‘PCR jackpot effect’, with the result that a lesion became indistinguishable from a true mutation or variant. Finally, we showed that artifactual mutations derived from uracil and 8-oxoguanine could be significantly reduced by DNA repair enzymes.</p>

Aging impairs both primary and secondary RIG-I signaling for interferon induction in human monocytes
<p>Adults older than 65 account for most of the deaths caused by respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infections, but the underlying mechanisms for this susceptibility are poorly understood. IAV RNA is detected by the cytosolic sensor retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I), which induces the production of type I interferons (IFNs) that curtail the spread of the virus and promote the elimination of infected cells. We have previously identified a marked defect in the IAV-inducible secretion of type I IFNs, but not proinflammatory cytokines, in monocytes from older (>65 years) healthy human donors. We found that monocytes from older adults exhibited decreased abundance of the adaptor protein TRAF3 (tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 3) because of its increased proteasomal degradation with age, thereby impairing the primary RIG-I signaling pathway for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of type I IFNs. We determined that monocytes from older adults also failed to effectively stimulate the production of the IFN regulatory transcription factor IRF8, which compromised IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion through secondary RIG-I signaling. IRF8 played a central role in IFN <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion in monocytes, because knocking down IRF8 in monocytes from younger adults was sufficient to replicate the IFN defects observed in monocytes from older adults, whereas restoring IRF8 expression in older adult monocytes was sufficient to restore RIG-I–induced IFN responses. Aging thus compromises both the primary and secondary RIG-I signaling pathways that govern expression of type I IFN genes, thereby impairing antiviral resistance to IAV.</p>

The tumor as organizer model
<p>In 1924, Hans Spemann and Hilde Mangold reported that a small collection of cells taken from a gastrulating newt embryo could, when transplanted into a separate embryo, coax the newly adjacent cells to form a second embryonic axis (<i>1</i>). This collection of embryonic cells came to be called the “organizer,” and its identification codified the concept of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion—that cells influence their neighbors to change fate, often in dramatic fashion. Importantly, the organizer does not actually “organize” the embryo; rather, it initiates a cascade of sequential <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion events that ultimately give the embryo its shape. In the decades since this landmark observation, it has become clear that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion plays a ubiquitous role in both embryonic and adult tissues, and that secreted and/or membrane-associated factors mediate the process. How does the embryonic organizer model apply to the various features of malignant progression, including stroma formation, metastatic spread, and tumor heterogeneity?</p>

However, Brillouin interactions are markedly weak in conventional silicon photonic waveguides, stifling progress toward silicon-based Brillouin lasers. The recent advent of hybrid photonic-phononic waveguides has revealed Brillouin interactions to be one of the strongest and most tailorable nonlinearities in silicon.

A bioinspired flexible organic artificial afferent nerve
<p>The distributed network of receptors, neurons, and synapses in the somatosensory system efficiently processes complex tactile information. We used flexible organic electronics to mimic the functions of a sensory nerve. Our artificial afferent nerve collects pressure information (1 to 80 kilopascals) from clusters of pressure sensors, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong>s the pressure information into action potentials (0 to 100 hertz) by using ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators, and integrates the action potentials from multiple ring <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lators with a synaptic transistor. Biomimetic hierarchical structures can detect movement of an object, combine simultaneous pressure inputs, and distinguish braille characters. Furthermore, we connected our artificial afferent nerve to motor nerves to construct a hybrid bioelectronic reflex arc to actuate muscles. Our system has potential applications in neurorobotics and neuroprosthetics.</p>

Calibrated mitotic oscillator drives motile ciliogenesis
<p>Cell division and differentiation depend on massive and rapid organelle remodeling. The mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator, centered on the cyclin-dependent kinase 1–anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (CDK1-APC/C) axis, spatiotemporally coordinates this reorganization in dividing cells. Here we discovered that nondividing cells could also implement this mitotic clocklike regulatory circuit to orchestrate subcellular reorganization associated with differentiation. We probed centriole <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation in differentiating mouse-brain multiciliated cells. These postmitotic progenitors fine-tuned mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator activity to drive the orderly progression of centriole production, maturation, and motile ciliation while avoiding the mitosis commitment threshold. Insufficient CDK1 activity hindered differentiation, whereas excessive activity accelerated differentiation yet drove postmitotic progenitors into mitosis. Thus, postmitotic cells can redeploy and calibrate the mitotic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator to uncouple cytoplasmic from nuclear dynamics for organelle remodeling associated with differentiation.</p>

Optical imaging of surface chemistry and dynamics in confinement

High-temperature quantum oscillations caused by recurring Bloch states in graphene superlattices
<p>Cyclotron motion of charge carriers in metals and semiconductors leads to Landau quantization and magneto-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>latory behavior in their properties. Cryogenic temperatures are usually required to observe these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations. We show that graphene superlattices support a different type of quantum <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lation that does not rely on Landau quantization. The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations are extremely robust and persist well above room temperature in magnetic fields of only a few tesla. We attribute this phenomenon to repetitive changes in the electronic structure of superlattices such that charge carriers experience effectively no magnetic field at simple fractions of the flux quantum per superlattice unit cell. Our work hints at unexplored physics in Hofstadter butterfly systems at high temperatures.</p>

Macrophage function in tissue repair and remodeling requires IL-4 or IL-13 with apoptotic cells
<p>Tissue repair is a subset of a broad repertoire of interleukin-4 (IL-4)– and IL-13–dependent host responses during helminth infection. Here we show that IL-4 or IL-13 alone was not sufficient, but IL-4 or IL-13 together with apoptotic cells induced the tissue repair program in macrophages. Genetic ablation of sensors of apoptotic cells impaired the proliferation of tissue-resident macrophages and the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of anti-inflammatory and tissue repair genes in the lungs after helminth infection or in the gut after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of colitis.

Identification of Genes Encoding Enzymes Catalyzing the Early Steps of Carrot Polyacetylene Biosynthesis
<p>Polyacetylenic lipids accumulate in various Apiaceae species after pathogen attack, suggesting that these compounds are naturally occurring pesticides and potentially valuable resources for crop improvement. These compounds also promote human health and slow tumor growth. Even though polyacetylenic lipids were discovered decades ago, the biosynthetic pathway underlying their production is largely unknown. To begin filling this gap and ultimately enable polyacetylene engineering, we studied polyacetylenes and their biosynthesis in the major Apiaceae crop carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i> subsp. <i>sativus</i>). Using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, we identified three known polyacetylenes and assigned provisional structures to two novel polyacetylenes. We also quantified these compounds in carrot leaf, petiole, root xylem, root phloem, and root periderm extracts. Falcarindiol and falcarinol predominated and accumulated primarily in the root periderm. Since the multiple double and triple carbon-carbon bonds that distinguish polyacetylenes from ubiquitous fatty acids are often introduced by Δ12 oleic acid desaturase (FAD2)-type enzymes, we mined the carrot genome for <i>FAD2</i> genes. We identified a <i>FAD2</i> family with an unprecedented 24 members and analyzed public, tissue-specific carrot RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed members with root periderm-enhanced expression. Six candidate genes were heterologously expressed individually and in combination in yeast and Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), resulting in the identification of one canonical FAD2 that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong>s oleic to linoleic acid, three divergent FAD2-like acetylenases that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong> linoleic into crepenynic acid, and two bifunctional FAD2s with Δ12 and Δ14 desaturase activity that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong> crepenynic into the further desaturated dehydrocrepenynic acid, a polyacetylene pathway intermediate. These genes can now be used as a basis for discovering other steps of falcarin-type polyacetylene biosynthesis, to modulate polyacetylene levels in plants, and to test the in planta function of these molecules.</p>

Flavodiiron-Mediated O<sub>2</sub> Photoreduction Links H<sub>2</sub> Production with CO<sub>2</sub> Fixation during the Anaerobic Induction of Photosynthesis
<p>Some microalgae, such as <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>, harbor a highly flexible photosynthetic apparatus capable of using different electron acceptors, including carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), protons, or oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), allowing survival in diverse habitats. During anaerobic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of photosynthesis, molecular O<sub>2</sub> is produced at photosystem II, while at the photosystem I acceptor side, the reduction of protons into hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) by the plastidial [FeFe]-hydrogenases primes CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Although the interaction between H<sub>2</sub> production and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation has been studied extensively, their interplay with O<sub>2</sub> produced by photosynthesis has not been considered. By simultaneously measuring gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence, we identified an O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction mechanism that functions during anaerobic dark-to-light transitions and demonstrate that flavodiiron proteins (Flvs) are the major players involved in light-dependent O<sub>2</sub> uptake. We further show that Flv-mediated O<sub>2</sub> uptake is critical for the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation but is not involved in the creation of the micro-oxic niches proposed previously to protect the [FeFe]-hydrogenase from O<sub>2</sub>. By studying a mutant lacking both hydrogenases (HYDA1 and HYDA2) and both Flvs (FLVA and FLVB), we show that the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of photosynthesis is strongly delayed in the absence of both sets of proteins. Based on these data, we propose that Flvs are involved in an important intracellular O<sub>2</sub> recycling process, which acts as a relay between H<sub>2</sub> production and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation.</p>

Selective Elimination of Membrane-Damaged Chloroplasts via Microautophagy
<p>Plant chloroplasts constantly accumulate damage caused by visible wavelengths of light during photosynthesis. Our previous study revealed that entire photodamaged chloroplasts are subjected to vacuolar digestion through an autophagy process termed chlorophagy; however, how this process is induced and executed remained poorly understood. In this study, we monitored intracellular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of chlorophagy in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves and found that mesophyll cells damaged by high visible light displayed abnormal chloroplasts with a swollen shape and 2.5 times the volume of normal chloroplasts. In wild-type plants, the activation of chlorophagy decreased the number of swollen chloroplasts. In the autophagy-deficient <i>autophagy</i> mutants, the swollen chloroplasts persisted, and dysfunctional chloroplasts that had lost chlorophyll fluorescence accumulated in the cytoplasm. Chloroplast swelling and subsequent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of chlorophagy were suppressed by the application of exogenous mannitol to increase the osmotic pressure outside chloroplasts or by overexpression of VESICLE INDUCING PROTEIN IN PLASTID1, which maintains chloroplast envelope integrity. Microscopic observations of autophagy-related membranes showed that swollen chloroplasts were partly surrounded by autophagosomal structures and were engulfed directly by the tonoplast, as in microautophagy. Our results indicate that an elevation in osmotic potential inside the chloroplast due to high visible light-derived envelope damage results in chloroplast swelling and serves as an <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion factor for chlorophagy, and this process mobilizes entire chloroplasts via tonoplast-mediated sequestering to avoid the cytosolic accumulation of dysfunctional chloroplasts.</p>

The Phosphate Fast-Responsive Genes <i>PECP1</i> and <i>PPsPase1</i> Affect Phosphocholine and Phosphoethanolamine Content<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Phosphate starvation-mediated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of the HAD-type phosphatases PPsPase1 (AT1G73010) and PECP1 (AT1G17710) has been reported in Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>). However, little is known about their in vivo function or impact on plant responses to nutrient deficiency. The preferences of PPsPase1 and PECP1 for different substrates have been studied in vitro but require confirmation in planta. Here, we examined the in vivo function of both enzymes using a reverse genetics approach. We demonstrated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 affect plant phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine content, but not the pyrophosphate-related phenotypes. These observations suggest that the enzymes play a similar role in planta related to the recycling of polar heads from membrane lipids that is triggered during phosphate starvation. Altering the expression of the genes encoding these enzymes had no effect on lipid composition, possibly due to compensation by other lipid recycling pathways triggered during phosphate starvation. Furthermore, our results indicated that PPsPase1 and PECP1 do not influence phosphate homeostasis, since the inactivation of these genes had no effect on phosphate content or on the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of molecular markers related to phosphate starvation. A combination of transcriptomics and imaging analyses revealed that PPsPase1 and PECP1 display a highly dynamic expression pattern that closely mirrors the phosphate status. This temporal dynamism, combined with the wide range of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion levels, broad expression, and lack of a direct effect on Pi content and regulation, makes PPsPase1 and PECP1 useful molecular markers of the phosphate starvation response.</p>

Gene Duplication and Aneuploidy Trigger Rapid Evolution of Herbicide Resistance in Common Waterhemp<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>An increase in gene copy number is often associated with changes in the number and structure of chromosomes, as has been widely observed in yeast and eukaryotic tumors, yet little is known about stress-induced chromosomal changes in plants. Previously, we reported that the <i>EPSPS</i> (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene, the molecular target of glyphosate, was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed at the native locus and on an extra chromosome in glyphosate-resistant <i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>. Here, we report that the extra chromosome is a ring chromosome termed extra circular chromosome carrying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed <i>EPSPS</i> (ECCAE). The ECCAE is heterochromatic, harbors four major <i>EPSPS</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>ed foci, and is sexually transmitted to 35% of the progeny. Two highly glyphosate resistant (HGR) <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants with a chromosome constitution of 2n = 32+1 ECCAE displayed soma cell heterogeneity. Some cells had secondary ECCAEs, which displayed size polymorphisms and produced novel chromosomal variants with multiple gene <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation foci. We hypothesize that the ECCAE in the soma cells of HGR <i>A. tuberculatus</i> plants underwent breakage-fusion-bridge cycles to generate the observed soma cell heterogeneity, including de novo <i>EPSPS</i> gene integration into chromosomes. Resistant soma cells with stable <i>EPSPS</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">amplifi</span></strong>cation events as de novo insertions into chromosomes may survive glyphosate selection pressure during the sporophytic phase and are plausibly transmitted to germ cells leading to durable glyphosate resistance in <i>A. tuberculatus</i>. This is the first report of early events in aneuploidy-triggered de novo chromosome integration by an as yet unknown mechanism, which may drive rapid adaptive evolution of herbicide resistance in common waterhemp.</p>

Gene Regulation and Survival under Hypoxia Requires Starch Availability and Metabolism
<p>Plants respond to hypoxia, often caused by submergence, by expressing a specific set of genes that contribute to acclimation to this unfavorable environmental condition. Genes induced by low oxygen include those encoding enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism and fermentation, pathways that are required for survival. Sugar availability is therefore of crucial importance for energy production under hypoxia. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) plants require starch for surviving submergence as well as for ensuring the rapid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of genes encoding enzymes required for anaerobic metabolism. The starchless <i>pgm</i> mutant is highly susceptible to submergence and also fails to induce anaerobic genes at the level of the wild type. Treating wild-type plants under conditions inducing sugar starvation results in a weak <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of alcohol dehydrogenase and other anaerobic genes. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of gene expression under hypoxia requires transcription factors belonging to group VII ethylene response factors (ERF-VII) that, together with plant Cys oxidases, act as an oxygen-sensing mechanism. We show that repression of this pathway by sugar starvation occurs downstream of the hypoxia-dependent stabilization of ERF-VII proteins and independently of the energy sensor protein kinases SnRK1.1 (SNF1-related kinase 1.1).</p>

Biochemical Principles and Functional Aspects of Pipecolic Acid Biosynthesis in Plant Immunity
<p>The nonprotein amino acid pipecolic acid (Pip) regulates plant systemic acquired resistance and basal immunity to bacterial pathogen infection. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the lysine (Lys) aminotransferase AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1 (ALD1) mediates the pathogen-induced accumulation of Pip in inoculated and distal leaf tissue. Here, we show that ALD1 transfers the α-amino group of <sc>l</sc>-Lys to acceptor oxoacids. Combined mass spectrometric and infrared spectroscopic analyses of in vitro assays and plant extracts indicate that the final product of the ALD1-catalyzed reaction is enaminic 2,3-dehydropipecolic acid (DP), whose formation involves consecutive transamination, cyclization, and isomerization steps. Besides <sc>l</sc>-Lys, recombinant ALD1 transaminates <sc>l</sc>-methionine, <sc>l</sc>-leucine, diaminopimelate, and several other amino acids to generate oxoacids or derived products in vitro. However, detailed in planta analyses suggest that the biosynthesis of 2,3-DP from <sc>l</sc>-Lys is the major in vivo function of ALD1. Since <i>ald1</i> mutant plants are able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong> exogenous 2,3-DP into Pip, their Pip deficiency relies on the inability to form the 2,3-DP intermediate. The Arabidopsis reductase ornithine cyclodeaminase/μ-crystallin, alias SYSTEMIC ACQUIRED RESISTANCE-DEFICIENT4 (SARD4), <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong>s ALD1-generated 2,3-DP into Pip in vitro. SARD4 significantly contributes to the production of Pip in pathogen-inoculated leaves but is not the exclusive reducing enzyme involved in Pip biosynthesis. Functional <i>SARD4</i> is required for proper basal immunity to the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>. Although <i>SARD4</i> knockout plants show greatly reduced accumulation of Pip in leaves distal to <i>P. syringae</i> inoculation, they display a considerable systemic acquired resistance response. This suggests a triggering function of locally accumulating Pip for systemic resistance <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion.</p>

Molecular Regulation of Temperature-Dependent Floral Induction in <i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>
<p>The vegetative-to-reproductive phase change in tulip (<i>Tulipa gesneriana</i>) is promoted by increasing temperatures during spring. The warm winters of recent years interfere with this process and are calling for new adapted cultivars. A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms would be of help, but unlike the model plant Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), very little is known about floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion in tulip. To shed light on the gene regulatory network controlling flowering in tulip, RNA sequencing was performed on meristem-enriched tissue collected under two contrasting temperature conditions, low and high. The start of reproductive development correlated with rounding of the shoot apical meristem and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of <i>TGSQA</i> expression, a tulip gene with a high similarity to Arabidopsis <i>APETALA1</i>. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed the overrepresentation of genes potentially involved in floral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion, bulb maturation, and dormancy establishment. Expression analysis revealed that <i>TERMINAL FLOWER1</i> (<i>TgTFL1</i>) and <i>SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1-like1</i> (<i>TgSOC1-like1</i>) might be repressors, whereas <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> likely is an activator, of flowering. Subsequently, the flowering time-associated expression of eight potential flowering time genes was confirmed in three tulip cultivars grown in the field. Additionally, heterologous functional analyses in Arabidopsis resulted in flowering time phenotypes in line with <i>TgTFL1</i> being a floral repressor and <i>TgSOC1-like2</i> being a floral activator in tulip. Taken together, we have shown that long before morphological changes occur in the shoot apical meristem, the expression of floral repressors in tulip is suppressed by increased ambient temperatures, leading either directly or indirectly to the activation of potential flowering activators shortly before the commencement of the phase change.</p>

Ligand-dependent Notch signaling strength orchestrates lateral induction and lateral inhibition in the developing inner ear
<p>During inner ear development, Notch exhibits two modes of operation: lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion, which is associated with prosensory specification, and lateral inhibition, which is involved in hair cell determination. These mechanisms depend respectively on two different ligands, jagged 1 (Jag1) and delta 1 (Dl1), that rely on a common signaling cascade initiated after Notch activation. In the chicken otocyst, expression of Jag1 and the Notch target Hey1 correlates well with lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion, whereas both Jag1 and Dl1 are expressed during lateral inhibition, as are Notch targets Hey1 and Hes5. Here, we show that Jag1 drives lower levels of Notch activity than Dl1, which results in the differential expression of Hey1 and Hes5. In addition, Jag1 interferes with the ability of Dl1 to elicit high levels of Notch activity. Modeling the sensory epithelium when the two ligands are expressed together shows that ligand regulation, differential signaling strength and ligand competition are crucial to allow the two modes of operation and for establishing the alternate pattern of hair cells and supporting cells. Jag1, while driving lateral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion on its own, facilitates patterning by lateral inhibition in the presence of Dl1. This novel behavior emerges from Jag1 acting as a competitive inhibitor of Dl1 for Notch signaling. Both modeling and experiments show that hair cell patterning is very robust. The model suggests that autoactivation of proneural factor Atoh1, upstream of Dl1, is a fundamental component for robustness. The results stress the importance of the levels of Notch signaling and ligand competition for Notch function.</p>

Zebrafish Foxi1 provides a neuronal ground state during inner ear induction preceding the Dlx3b/4b-regulated sensory lineage
<p>Vertebrate inner ear development is a complex process that involves the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of a common territory for otic and epibranchial precursors and their subsequent segregation into otic and epibranchial cell fates. In zebrafish, the otic-epibranchial progenitor domain (OEPD) is induced by Fgf signaling in a Foxi1- and Dlx3b/4b-dependent manner, but the functional differences of Foxi1 and Dlx3b/4b in subsequent cell fate specifications within the developing inner ear are poorly understood. Based on pioneer tracking (PioTrack), a novel Cre-dependent genetic lineage tracing method, and genetic data, we show that the competence to embark on a neuronal or sensory fate is provided sequentially and very early during otic placode <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion. Loss of Foxi1 prevents neuronal precursor formation without affecting hair cell specification, whereas loss of Dlx3b/4b inhibits hair cell but not neuronal precursor formation. Consistently, in Dlx3b/4b- and Sox9a-deficient <i>b380</i> mutants almost all otic epithelial fates are absent, including sensory hair cells, and the remaining otic cells adopt a neuronal fate. Furthermore, the progenitors of the anterior lateral line ganglia also arise from the OEPD in a Foxi1-dependent manner but are unaffected in the absence of Dlx3b/4b or in <i>b380</i> mutants. Thus, in addition to otic fate Foxi1 provides neuronal competence during OEPD <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion prior to and independently of the Dlx3b/4b-mediated sensory fate of the developing inner ear.</p>

MPs were prepared from ECs and venous blood from patients with ACS (n=30) and from healthy volunteers (n=4) by sequential centrifugation. The level of endothelial senescence was assessed as senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity using flow cytometry, oxidative stress using the redox-sensitive probe dihydroethidium, tissue factor activity using an enzymatic Tenase assay, the level of target protein expression by Western blot analysis, platelet aggregation using an aggregometer, and shear stress using a cone-and-plate viscometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Senescence, as assessed by senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, was induced by the passaging of porcine coronary artery ECs from passage P1 to P4, and was associated with a progressive shedding of procoagulant MPs. Exposure of P1 ECs to MPs shed from senescent P3 cells or circulating MPs from ACS patients induced increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, oxidative stress, early phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and Akt, and upregulation of p53, p21, and p16. Ex vivo, the prosenescent effect of circulating MPs from ACS patients was evidenced only under conditions of low shear stress. Depletion of endothelial-derived MPs from ACS patients reduced the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of senescence. Prosenescent MPs promoted EC thrombogenicity through tissue factor upregulation, shedding of procoagulant MPs, endothelial nitric oxide synthase downregulation, and reduced nitric oxide–mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation.

High-performance light-emitting diodes based on carbene-metal-amides
<p>Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) promise highly efficient lighting and display technologies.

Key to this performance is their rapid and efficient utilization of triplet states. Using time-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolv</span></strong>ed spectroscopy, we establish that luminescence via triplets occurs within 350 nanoseconds at ambient temperature, after reverse intersystem crossing to singlets. We find that molecular geometries exist at which the singlet-triplet energy gap (exchange energy) is close to zero, so that rapid interconversion is possible. Calculations indicate that exchange energy is tuned by relative rotation of the donor and acceptor moieties about the bridge. Unlike other systems with low exchange energy, substantial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator strength is sustained at the singlet-triplet degeneracy point.</p>

Structures of the cyanobacterial circadian oscillator frozen in a fully assembled state
<p>Cyanobacteria have a robust circadian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator, known as the Kai system. Reconstituted from the purified protein components KaiC, KaiB, and KaiA, it can tick autonomously in the presence of adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP). The KaiC hexamers enter a natural 24-hour reaction cycle of autophosphorylation and assembly with KaiB and KaiA in numerous diverse forms. We describe the preparation of stoichiometrically well-defined assemblies of KaiCB and KaiCBA, as monitored by native mass spectrometry, allowing for a structural characterization by single-particle cryo–electron microscopy and mass spectrometry. Our data reveal details of the interactions between the Kai proteins and provide a structural basis to understand periodic assembly of the protein <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lator.</p>

Lipid transport by TMEM24 at ER–plasma membrane contacts regulates pulsatile insulin secretion
<p>Insulin is released by β cells in pulses regulated by calcium and phosphoinositide signaling. Here, we describe how transmembrane protein 24 (TMEM24) helps coordinate these signaling events. We showed that TMEM24 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–anchored membrane protein whose reversible localization to ER-plasma membrane (PM) contacts is governed by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations in cytosolic calcium. A lipid-binding module in TMEM24 transports the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] precursor phosphatidylinositol between bilayers, allowing replenishment of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> hydrolyzed during signaling. In the absence of TMEM24, calcium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">oscil</span></strong>lations are abolished, leading to a defect in triggered insulin release. Our findings implicate direct lipid transport between the ER and the PM in the control of insulin secretion, a process impaired in patients with type II diabetes.</p>

Gliogenic LTP spreads widely in nociceptive pathways
<p>Learning and memory formation involve long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength. A fundamental feature of LTP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion in the brain is the need for coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity.

Attosecond dynamics through a Fano resonance: Monitoring the birth of a photoelectron
<p>The dynamics of quantum systems are encoded in the amplitude and phase of wave packets. However, the rapidity of electron dynamics on the attosecond scale has precluded the complete characterization of electron wave packets in the time domain. Using spectrally <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolv</span></strong>ed electron interferometry, we were able to measure the amplitude and phase of a photoelectron wave packet created through a Fano autoionizing resonance in helium. In our setup, replicas obtained by two-photon transitions interfere with reference wave packets that are formed through smooth continua, allowing the full temporal reconstruction, purely from experimental data, of the resonant wave packet released in the continuum. In turn, this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">resolv</span></strong>es the buildup of the autoionizing resonance on an attosecond time scale. Our results, in excellent agreement with ab initio time-dependent calculations, raise prospects for detailed investigations of ultrafast photoemission dynamics governed by electron correlation, as well as coherent control over structured electron wave packets.</p>

Glucose-Regulated <i>HLP1</i> Acts as a Key Molecule in Governing Thermomemory
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in response to heat stress (HS) is indispensable for conferring thermotolerance. Glc, a fundamental signaling and metabolic molecule, provides energy to stressed seedlings to combat stress. The recovery of stressed plants from detrimental HS in response to Glc is largely mediated by HSPs, but the mechanistic basis of this thermotolerance is not well defined. In this study, we show that Glc has a prominent role in providing thermotolerance. Glc-mediated thermotolerance involves HSP <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion via the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR)-E2Fa signaling module. Apart from HSPs, TOR-E2Fa also regulates the Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) ortholog of human <i>Hikeshi</i>, named <i>HIKESHI</i>-<i>LIKE PROTEIN1</i> (<i>HLP1</i>). Expression of <i>proHLP1</i>::<i>GUS</i> in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) after HS coincides with TOR-E2Fa expression, substantiating a role for TOR-E2Fa-HLP1 in providing thermotolerance. We also demonstrate that Glc along with heat could induce proliferation activity in the SAM after HS recovery, which was arrested by the TOR inhibitor AZD-8055. Molecular and physiological studies suggest that HS-activated heat stress transcription factor A1s also positively regulate <i>HLP1</i> transcription, suggesting convergence of the Glc and HS signaling pathways. Loss of functional HLP1 causes HS hypersensitivity, whereas HLP1 overexpressors display increased thermotolerance. HLP1 binds to the promoters of Glc-regulated HS-responsive genes and promotes chromatin acetylation. In addition, Glc modifies the chromatin landscape at thermomemory-related loci by promoting H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Glc-primed accumulation of H3K4me3 at thermomemory-associated loci is mediated through HLP1. These findings reveal the novel function of Glc-regulated <i>HLP1</i> in mediating thermotolerance/thermomemory response.</p>

Molecular Mechanisms Preventing Senescence in Response to Prolonged Darkness in a Desiccation-Tolerant Plant
<p>The desiccation-tolerant plant <i>Haberlea rhodopensis</i> can withstand months of darkness without any visible senescence. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this adaptation to prolonged (30 d) darkness and subsequent return to light. <i>H. rhodopensis</i> plants remained green and viable throughout the dark treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that darkness regulated several transcription factor (TF) genes. Stress- and autophagy-related TFs such as <i>ERF8</i>, <i>HSFA2b</i>, <i>RD26</i>, <i>TGA1</i>, and <i>WRKY33</i> were up-regulated, while chloroplast- and flowering-related TFs such as <i>ATH1</i>, <i>COL2</i>, <i>COL4</i>, <i>RL1</i>, and <i>PTAC7</i> were repressed. <i>PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4</i>, a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and promoter of senescence, also was down-regulated. In response to darkness, most of the photosynthesis- and photorespiratory-related genes were strongly down-regulated, while genes related to autophagy were up-regulated. This occurred concomitant with the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASES (SnRK1) signaling pathway genes, which regulate responses to stress-induced starvation and autophagy. Most of the genes associated with chlorophyll catabolism, which are induced by darkness in dark-senescing species, were either unregulated (<i>PHEOPHORBIDE A OXYGENASE, PAO; RED CHLOROPHYLL CATABOLITE REDUCTASE, RCCR</i>) or repressed (<i>STAY GREEN-LIKE</i>, <i>PHEOPHYTINASE</i>, and <i>NON-YELLOW COLORING1</i>). Metabolite profiling revealed increases in the levels of many amino acids in darkness, suggesting increased protein degradation. In darkness, levels of the chloroplastic lipids digalactosyldiacylglycerol, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol decreased, while those of storage triacylglycerols increased, suggesting degradation of chloroplast membrane lipids and their conversion to triacylglycerols for use as energy and carbon sources. Collectively, these data show a coordinated response to darkness, including repression of photosynthetic, photorespiratory, flowering, and chlorophyll catabolic genes, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of autophagy and SnRK1 pathways, and metabolic reconfigurations that enable survival under prolonged darkness.</p>

Candidate Enzymes for Saffron Crocin Biosynthesis Are Localized in Multiple Cellular Compartments
<p>Saffron is the dried stigmas of <i>Crocus sativus</i> and is the most expensive spice in the world. Its red color is due to crocins, which are apocarotenoid glycosides that accumulate in the vacuole to a level up to 10% of the stigma dry weight. Previously, we characterized the first dedicated enzyme in the crocin biosynthetic pathway, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase2 (CsCCD2), which cleaves zeaxanthin to yield crocetin dialdehyde. In this work, we identified six putative <i>aldehyde dehydrogenase</i> (<i>ALDH</i>) genes expressed in <i>C. sativus</i> stigmas. Heterologous expression in <i>Escherichia coli</i> showed that only one of corresponding proteins (CsALDH3I1) was able to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong> crocetin dialdehyde into the crocin precursor crocetin. CsALDH3I1 carries a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain, similar to that of the <i>Neurospora crassa</i> membrane-associated apocarotenoid dehydrogenase YLO-1. We also characterized the UDP-glycosyltransferase CsUGT74AD1, which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong>s crocetin to crocins 1 and 2′. In vitro assays revealed high specificity of CsALDH3I1 for crocetin dialdehyde and long-chain apocarotenals and of CsUGT74AD1 for crocetin. Following extract fractionation, CsCCD2, CsALDH3I1, and CsUGT74AD1 were found in the insoluble fraction, suggesting their association with membranes or large insoluble complexes. Analysis of protein localization in both <i>C. sativus</i> stigmas and following transgene expression in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves revealed that CsCCD2, CsALDH3I, and CsUGT74AD1 were localized to the plastids, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the cytoplasm, respectively, in association with cytoskeleton-like structures. Based on these findings and current literature, we propose that the endoplasmic reticulum and cytoplasm function as transit centers for metabolites whose biosynthesis starts in the plastid and are accumulated in the vacuole.</p>

SIAMESE-RELATED1 Is Regulated Posttranslationally and Participates in Repression of Leaf Growth under Moderate Drought
<p>The plant cell cycle is tightly regulated by factors that integrate endogenous cues and environmental signals to adapt plant growth to changing conditions. Under drought, cell division in young leaves is blocked by an active mechanism, reducing the evaporative surface and conserving energy resources. The molecular function of cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory proteins (CKIs) in regulating the cell cycle has already been well studied, but little is known about their involvement in cell cycle regulation under adverse growth conditions. In this study, we show that the transcript of the CKI gene <i>SIAMESE-RELATED1</i> (<i>SMR1</i>) is quickly induced under moderate drought in young Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) leaves. Functional characterization further revealed that SMR1 inhibits cell division and affects meristem activity, thereby restricting the growth of leaves and roots. Moreover, we demonstrate that SMR1 is a short-lived protein that is degraded by the 26S proteasome after being ubiquitinated by a Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. Consequently, overexpression of a more stable variant of the SMR1 protein leads to a much stronger phenotype than overexpression of the native SMR1. Under moderate drought, both the <i>SMR1</i> transcript and SMR1 protein accumulate. Despite this <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion, <i>smr1</i> mutants do not show overall tolerance to drought stress but do show less growth inhibition of young leaves under drought. Surprisingly, the growth-repressive hormone ethylene promotes <i>SMR1</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion, but the classical drought hormone abscisic acid does not.</p>

PROHIBITIN3 Forms Complexes with ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 to Regulate Stress-Induced Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis
<p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a major defense signal in plants. In Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>), the chloroplast-localized isochorismate pathway is the main source of SA biosynthesis during abiotic stress or pathogen infections. In the first step of the pathway, the enzyme ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1 (ICS1) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong>s chorismate to isochorismate. An unknown enzyme subsequently <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong>s isochorismate to SA. Here, we show that ICS1 protein levels increase during UV-C stress. To identify proteins that may play roles in SA production by regulating ICS1, we analyzed proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with ICS1 via mass spectrometry. The ICS1 complexes contained a large number of peptides from the PROHIBITIN (PHB) protein family, with PHB3 the most abundant. PHB proteins have diverse biological functions that include acting as scaffolds for protein complex formation and stabilization. PHB3 was reported previously to localize to mitochondria. Using fractionation, protease protection, and live imaging, we show that PHB3 also localizes to chloroplasts, where ICS1 resides. Notably, loss of PHB3 function led to decreased ICS1 protein levels in response to UV-C stress. However, <i>ICS1</i> transcript levels remain unchanged, indicating that ICS1 is regulated posttranscriptionally. The <i>phb3</i> mutant displayed reduced levels of SA, the SA-regulated protein PR1, and hypersensitive cell death in response to UV-C and avirulent strains of <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and, correspondingly, supported increased growth of <i>P. syringae</i>. The expression of a <i>PHB3</i> transgene in the <i>phb3</i> mutant complemented all of these phenotypes. We suggest a model in which the formation of PHB3-ICS1 complexes stabilizes ICS1 to promote SA production in response to stress.</p>

Transcription Factor-Mediated Control of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Vegetative Tissues
<p>Plants accumulate secondary metabolites to adapt to environmental conditions. These compounds, here exemplified by the purple-colored anthocyanins, are accumulated upon high temperatures, UV-light, drought, and nutrient deficiencies, and may contribute to tolerance to these stresses. Producing compounds is often part of a more broad response of the plant to changes in the environment. Here we investigate how a transcription-factor-mediated program for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis also has effects on formation of specialized cell structures and changes in the plant root architecture. A systems biology approach was developed in tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) for coordinated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of biosynthesis of anthocyanins, in a tissue- and development-independent manner. A transcription factor couple from <i>Antirrhinum</i> that is known to control anthocyanin biosynthesis was introduced in tomato under control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. By application of dexamethasone, anthocyanin formation was induced within 24 h in vegetative tissues and in undifferentiated cells. Profiles of metabolites and gene expression were analyzed in several tomato tissues. Changes in concentration of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds were observed in all tested tissues, accompanied by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of the biosynthetic pathways leading from Glc to anthocyanins. A number of pathways that are not known to be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were observed to be regulated. Anthocyanin-producing plants displayed profound physiological and architectural changes, depending on the tissue, including root branching, root epithelial cell morphology, seed germination, and leaf conductance. The inducible anthocyanin-production system reveals a range of phenomena that accompanies anthocyanin biosynthesis in tomato, including adaptions of the plants architecture and physiology.</p>

Light Signaling-Dependent Regulation of Photoinhibition and Photoprotection in Tomato<xref><sup>1</sup></xref>
<p>Photoreceptor-mediated light signaling plays a critical role in plant growth, development, and stress responses but its contribution to the spatial regulation of photoinhibition and photoprotection within the canopy remains unclear. Here, we show that low-red/far-red (<i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>) ratio light conditions significantly alleviate PSII and PSI photoinhibition in the shade leaves of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>) plants. This protection is accompanied by a phytochrome A-dependent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of LONG HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5). HY5 binds to the promoter of <i>ABA INSENSITIVE</i>5 (<i>ABI5</i>), triggering <i>RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG1</i> (<i>RBOH1</i>)-dependent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in the apoplast. Decreased levels of <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcripts increased cold-induced photoinhibition and abolished <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-induced alleviation of photoinhibition. <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> illumination induced nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll <i>a</i> fluorescence and increased the activities of Foyer-Halliwell-Asada cycle enzymes and cyclic electron flux (CEF) around PSI. In contrast, decreased <i>HY5</i>, <i>ABI5</i>, and <i>RBOH1</i> transcript levels abolished the positive effect of <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i> on photoprotection. Loss of <i>PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5</i>-dependent CEF led to increased photoinhibition and attenuated <i>L</i>-<i>R</i>/<i>FR</i>-dependent NPQ. These data demonstrate that HY5 is an important hub in the cross talk between light and cold response pathways, integrating ABA and reactive oxygen species signaling, leading to the attenuation of photoinhibition by enhanced <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of photoprotection in shade leaves.</p>

The RING-Type E3 Ligase XBAT35.2 Is Involved in Cell Death Induction and Pathogen Response
<p>XBAT35 belongs to a subfamily of Arabidopsis (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) RING-type E3s that are similar in domain architecture to the rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) XA21 Binding Protein3, a defense protein. The <i>XBAT35</i> transcript undergoes alternative splicing to produce two protein isoforms, XBAT35.1 and XBAT35.2. Here, we demonstrate that XBAT35.2 localizes predominantly to the Golgi and is involved in cell death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion and pathogen response. XBAT35.2, but not XBAT35.1, was found to trigger cell death when overexpressed in tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) leaves and does so in a manner that requires its RING domain. Loss of <i>XBAT35</i> gene function disrupts the plant’s ability to defend against pathogen attack, whereas overexpression of <i>XBAT35.2</i> enhances resistance to pathogens. XBAT35.2 was found to be unstable and promotes its own degradation, suggesting self-regulation. Inoculation with virulent and avirulent strains of the bacterial pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 results in a drastic reduction in the levels of ubiquitinated XBAT35.2 and an increase in the abundance of the E3. This implies that pathogen infection prohibits XBAT35.2 self-regulation and stabilizes the E3. In agreement with a role in defending against pathogens, XBAT35.2 interacts with defense-related Accelerated Cell Death11 (ACD11) in planta and promotes the proteasome-dependent turnover of ACD11 in cell-free degradation assays. In accordance with regulation by a stabilized XBAT35.2, the levels of ubiquitinated ACD11 increased considerably, and the abundance of ACD11 was reduced following pathogen infection. In addition, treatment of transgenic seedlings with a proteasome inhibitor results in the accumulation of ACD11, confirming proteasome-dependent degradation. Collectively, these results highlight a novel role for XBAT35.2 in cell death <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion and defense against pathogens.</p>

Different Routes for Conifer- and Sinapaldehyde and Higher Saccharification upon Deficiency in the Dehydrogenase CAD1
<p>In the search for renewable energy sources, genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve plant cell wall composition for biofuel and bioproducts generation. Lignin is a major factor determining saccharification efficiency and, therefore, is a prime target to engineer. Here, lignin content and composition were modified in poplar (<i>Populus tremula</i> × <i>Populus alba</i>) by specifically down-regulating <i>CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE1</i> (<i>CAD1</i>) by a hairpin-RNA-mediated silencing approach, which resulted in only 5% residual <i>CAD1</i> transcript abundance. These transgenic lines showed no biomass penalty despite a 10% reduction in Klason lignin content and severe shifts in lignin composition. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and thioacidolysis revealed a strong increase (up to 20-fold) in sinapaldehyde incorporation into lignin, whereas coniferaldehyde was not increased markedly. Accordingly, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based phenolic profiling revealed a more than 24,000-fold accumulation of a newly identified compound made from 8-8 coupling of two sinapaldehyde radicals. However, no additional cinnamaldehyde coupling products could be detected in the CAD1-deficient poplars. Instead, the transgenic lines accumulated a range of hydroxycinnamate-derived metabolites, of which the most prominent accumulation (over 8,500-fold) was observed for a compound that was identified by purification and nuclear magnetic resonance as syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Our data suggest that, upon down-regulation of <i>CAD1</i>, coniferaldehyde is <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong>ed into ferulic acid and derivatives, whereas sinapaldehyde is either oxidatively coupled into S′(8-8)S′ and lignin or <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">convert</span></strong>ed to sinapic acid and derivatives. The most prominent sink of the increased flux to hydroxycinnamates is syringyl lactic acid hexoside. Furthermore, low-extent saccharification assays, under different pretreatment conditions, showed strongly increased glucose (up to +81%) and xylose (up to +153%) release, suggesting that down-regulating <i>CAD1</i> is a promising strategy for improving lignocellulosic biomass for the sugar platform industry.</p>

BcXYG1, a Secreted Xyloglucanase from <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, Triggers Both Cell Death and Plant Immune Responses
<p>In search of <i>Botrytis cinerea</i> cell death-inducing proteins, we found a xyloglucanase (BcXYG1) that induced strong necrosis and a resistance response in dicot plants. Expression of the <i>BcXYG1</i> gene was strongly induced during the first 12 h post inoculation, and analysis of disease dynamics using PathTrack showed that a <i>B. cinerea</i> strain overexpressing <i>BcXYG1</i> produced early local necrosis, supporting a role of BcXYG1 as an early cell death-inducing factor. The xyloglucanase activity of BcXYG1 was not necessary for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of necrosis and plant resistance, as a mutant of BcXYG1 lacking the xyloglucanase enzymatic activity retained both functions. Residues in two exposed loops on the surface of BcXYG1 were found to be necessary for the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">induct</span></strong>ion of cell death but not to induce plant resistance. Further analyses showed that BcXYG1 is apoplastic and possibly interacts with the proteins of the plant cell membrane and also that the BcXYG1 cell death-promoting signal is mediated by the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases BAK1 and SOBIR1. Our findings support the role of cell death-inducing proteins in establishing the infection of necrotrophic pathogens and highlight the recognition of fungal apoplastic proteins by the plant immune system as an important mechanism of resistance against this class of pathogens.</p>

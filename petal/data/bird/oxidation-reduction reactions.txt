Room-temperature cycling of metal fluoride electrodes: Liquid electrolytes for high-energy fluoride ion cells
<p>Fluoride ion batteries are potential “next-generation” electrochemical storage devices that offer high energy density. At present, such batteries are limited to operation at high temperatures because suitable fluoride ion–conducting electrolytes are known only in the solid state. We report a liquid fluoride ion–conducting electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, wide operating voltage, and robust chemical stability based on dry tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts in ether solvents. Pairing this liquid electrolyte with a copper–lanthanum trifluoride (Cu@LaF<sub>3</sub>) core-shell cathode, we demonstrate reversible fluorination and defluorination reactions in a fluoride ion electrochemical cell cycled at room temperature. Fluoride ion–mediated electrochemistry offers a pathway toward developing capacities beyond that of lithium ion technology.</p>

A high-energy-density lithium-oxygen battery based on a reversible four-electron conversion to lithium oxide
<p>Lithium-oxygen (Li-O<sub>2</sub>) batteries have attracted much attention owing to the high theoretical energy density afforded by the two-electron reduction of O<sub>2</sub> to lithium peroxide (Li<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). We report an inorganic-electrolyte Li-O<sub>2</sub> cell that cycles at an elevated temperature via highly reversible four-electron redox to form crystalline lithium oxide (Li<sub>2</sub>O). It relies on a bifunctional metal oxide host that catalyzes O–O bond cleavage on discharge, yielding a high capacity of 11 milliampere-hours per square centimeter, and O<sub>2</sub> evolution on charge with very low overpotential. Online mass spectrometry and chemical quantification confirm that oxidation of Li<sub>2</sub>O involves transfer of exactly 4 <i>e</i><sup>–</sup>/O<sub>2</sub>. This work shows that Li-O<sub>2</sub> electrochemistry is not intrinsically limited once problems of electrolyte, superoxide, and cathode host are overcome and that coulombic efficiency close to 100% can be achieved.</p>

The [4Fe4S] cluster of human DNA primase functions as a redox switch using DNA charge transport
<p>DNA charge transport chemistry offers a means of long-range, rapid redox signaling. We demonstrate that the [4Fe4S] cluster in human DNA primase can make use of this chemistry to coordinate the first steps of DNA synthesis. Using DNA electrochemistry, we found that a change in oxidation state of the [4Fe4S] cluster acts as a switch for DNA binding. Single-atom mutations that inhibit this charge transfer hinder primase initiation without affecting primase structure or polymerization. Generating a single base mismatch in the growing primer duplex, which attenuates DNA charge transport, inhibits primer truncation. Thus, redox signaling by [4Fe4S] clusters using DNA charge transport regulates primase binding to DNA and illustrates chemistry that may efficiently drive substrate handoff between polymerases during DNA replication.</p>

Worsening Renal Function in Patients With Acute Heart Failure Undergoing Aggressive Diuresis Is Not Associated With Tubular Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Worsening renal function (WRF) in the setting of aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure treatment may reflect renal tubular injury or simply indicate a hemodynamic or functional change in glomerular filtration. Well-validated tubular injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>ers, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and kidney injury molecule 1, are now available that can quantify the degree of renal tubular injury. The ROSE-AHF trial (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation–Acute Heart Failure) provides an experimental platform for the study of mechanisms of WRF during aggressive diuresis for acute heart failure because the ROSE-AHF protocol dictated high-dose loop diuretic therapy in all patients. We sought to determine whether tubular injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>ers are associated with WRF in the setting of aggressive diuresis and its association with <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">prognosi</span></strong>s.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients in the multicenter ROSE-AHF trial with baseline and 72-hour urine tubular injury <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>ers were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed (n=283). WRF was defined as a ≥20% decrease in glomerular filtration rate estimated with cystatin C.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Consistent with protocol-driven aggressive dosing of loop diuretics, participants received a median 560 mg IV furosemide equivalents (interquartile range, 300–815 mg), which induced a urine output of 8425 mL (interquartile range, 6341–10 528 mL) over the 72-hour intervention period. Levels of <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 did not change with aggressive diuresis (both <i>P</i>>0.59), whereas levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin decreased slightly (−8.7 ng/mg; interquartile range, −169 to 35 ng/mg; <i>P</i><0.001). WRF occurred in 21.2% of the population and was not associated with an increase in any marker of renal tubular injury: neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (<i>P</i>=0.21), <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase (<i>P</i>=0.46), or kidney injury molecule 1 (<i>P</i>=0.22). Increases in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, <i>N</i>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosaminidase, and kidney injury molecule 1 were paradoxically associated with improved survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.80 per 10 percentile increase; 95% confidence interval, 0.69–0.91; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Kidney tubular injury does not appear to have an association with WRF in the context of aggressive diuresis of patients with acute heart failure. These findings reinforce the notion that the small to moderate deteriorations in renal function commonly encountered with aggressive diuresis are dissimilar from traditional causes of acute kidney injury.</p></sec>

Phenotypic Consequences of a Genetic Predisposition to Enhanced Nitric Oxide Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Nitric oxide signaling plays a key role in the regulation of vascular tone and platelet activation. Here, we seek to understand the impact of a genetic predisposition to enhanced nitric oxide signaling on risk for cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, thus informing the potential utility of pharmacological stimulation of the nitric oxide pathway as a therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed the association of common and rare genetic variants in 2 genes that mediate nitric oxide signaling (Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 [<i>NOS3</i>] and Guanylate Cyclase 1, Soluble, Alpha 3 [<i>GUCY1A3</i>]) with a range of human phenotypes. We selected 2 common variants (rs3918226 in <i>NOS3</i> and rs7692387 in <i>GUCY1A3</i>) known to associate with increased <i>NOS3</i> and <i>GUCY1A3</i> expression and reduced mean arterial pressure, combined them into a genetic score, and standardized this exposure to a 5 mm Hg reduction in mean arterial pressure.

Application of Large-Scale Aptamer-Based Proteomic Profiling to Planned Myocardial Infarctions
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Emerging proteomic technologies using novel affinity-based reagents allow for efficient multiplexing with high-sample throughput. To identify early <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>ers of myocardial injury, we recently applied an aptamer-based proteomic profiling platform that measures 1129 proteins to samples from patients undergoing septal alcohol ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a human model of planned myocardial injury. Here, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed the scalability of this approach using a markedly expanded platform to study a far broader range of human proteins in the context of myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a highly multiplexed, expanded proteomic technique that uses single-stranded DNA aptamers to assay 4783 human proteins (4137 distinct human gene targets) to derivation and validation cohorts of planned myocardial injury, individuals with spontaneous myocardial infarction, and at-risk controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We found 376 target proteins that significantly changed in the blood after planned myocardial injury in a derivation cohort (n=20; <i>P</i><1.05E-05, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance, Bonferroni threshold). Two hundred forty-seven of these proteins were validated in an independent planned myocardial injury cohort (n=15; <i>P</i><1.33E-04, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance); >90% were directionally consistent and reached nominal significance in the validation cohort. Among the validated proteins that were increased within 1 hour after planned myocardial injury, 29 were also elevated in patients with spontaneous myocardial infarction (n=63; <i>P</i><6.17E-04). Many of the novel markers identified in our study are intracellular proteins not previously identified in the peripheral circulation or have functional roles relevant to myocardial injury. For example, the cardiac LIM protein, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein 3, is thought to mediate cardiac mechanotransduction and stress responses, whereas the mitochondrial ATP synthase F<sub>0</sub> subunit component is a vasoactive peptide on its release from cells.

miR-22 Is a Novel Mediator of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Modulation and Neointima Formation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>MicroRNA-22 (miR-22) has recently been reported to play a regulatory role during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from stem cells, but little is known about its target genes and related pathways in mature VSMC phenotypic modulation or its clinical implication in neointima formation following vascular injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We applied a wire-injury mouse model, and local delivery of AgomiR-22 or miR-22 inhibitor, as well, to explore the therapeutic potential of miR-22 in vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. Furthermore, normal and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed human femoral arteries were harvested, and various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models of VSMC phenotype switching were conducted to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>e miR-22 expression during VSMC phenotype switching.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Expression of miR-22 was closely regulated during VSMC phenotypic modulation. miR-22 overexpression significantly increased expression of VSMC marker genes and inhibited VSMC proliferation and migration, whereas the opposite effect was observed when endogenous miR-22 was knocked down. As expected, 2 previously reported miR-22 target genes, MECP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) and histone deacetylase 4, exhibited a regulatory role in VSMC phenotypic modulation. A transcriptional regulator and oncoprotein, EVI1 (ecotropic virus integration site 1 protein homolog), has been identified as a novel miR-22 target gene in VSMC phenotypic modulation. It is noteworthy that overexpression of miR-22 in the injured vessels significantly reduced the expression of its target genes, decreased VSMC proliferation, and inhibited neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries, whereas the opposite effect was observed with local application of a miR-22 inhibitor to injured arteries. We next <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed the clinical relevance of miR-22 expression and its target genes in human femoral arteries.

Long-Term Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Myocardial Infarction and Myocardial Injury

All diagnoses were adjudicated as per the universal definition of myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, nonfatal myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) and noncardiovascular death. To explore competing risks, cause-specific hazard ratios were obtained using Cox regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The adjudicated index diagnosis was type 1 or 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury in 1171 (55.2%), 429 (20.2%), and 522 (24.6%) patients, respectively.

YAP-mediated mechanotransduction determines the podocyte’s response to damage
<p>Podocytes are terminally differentiated cells of the kidney filtration barrier. They are subjected to physiological filtration pressure and considerable mechanical strain, which can be further increased in various kidney <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. When injury causes cytoskeletal reorganization and morphological alterations of these cells, the filtration barrier may become compromised and allow proteins to leak into the urine (a condition called proteinuria). Using time-resolved proteomics, we showed that podocyte injury stimulated the activity of the transcriptional coactivator YAP and the expression of YAP target genes in a rat model of glomerular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e before the development of proteinuria. Although the activities of YAP and its ortholog TAZ are activated by mechanical stress in most cell types, injury reduced YAP and TAZ activity in cultured human and mouse podocyte cell lines grown on stiff substrates. Culturing these cells on soft matrix or inhibiting stress fiber formation recapitulated the damage-induced YAP up-regulation observed in vivo, indicating a mechanotransduction-dependent mechanism of YAP activation in podocytes. YAP overexpression in cultured podocytes increased the abundance of extracellular matrix–related proteins that can contribute to fibrosis. YAP activity was increased in mouse models of diabetic nephropathy, and the YAP target <i>CTGF</i> was highly expressed in renal biopsies from glomerular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e patients. Although overexpression of human YAP in mice induced mild proteinuria, pharmacological inhibition of the interaction between YAP and its partner TEAD in rats ameliorated glomerular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and reduced damage-induced mechanosignaling in the glomeruli. Thus, perturbation of YAP-dependent mechanosignaling is a potential therapeutic target for treating some glomerular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es.</p>

Poly(ADP-ribose) drives pathologic α-synuclein neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease
<p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ic accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) underlies Parkinson’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (PD). The molecular mechanisms by which <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ic α-syn causes neurodegeneration in PD are not known. Here, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ic α-syn activates poly(adenosine 5′-diphosphate–ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), and PAR generation accelerates the formation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ic α-syn, resulting in cell death via parthanatos. PARP inhibitors or genetic deletion of PARP-1 prevented <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ic α-syn toxicity. In a feed-forward loop, PAR converted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ic α-syn to a more toxic strain. PAR levels were increased in the cerebrospinal fluid and brains of patients with PD, suggesting that PARP activation plays a role in PD pathogenesis. Thus, strategies aimed at inhibiting PARP-1 activation could hold promise as a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-modifying therapy to prevent the loss of dopamine neurons in PD.</p>

A new and reliable classification system for fractures of the navicular and associated injuries to the midfoot
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>Fractures of the navicular can occur in isolation but, owing   to the intimate anatomical and biomechanical relationships, are   often associated with other <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es to the neighbouring bones and   joints in the foot. As a result, they can lead to long-term morbidity   and poor function. Our aim in this study was to identify patterns   of injury in a new classification system of traumatic fractures   of the navicular, with consideration being given to the commonly associated   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es to the midfoot.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We undertook a retrospective review of 285 consecutive patients   presenting over an eight- year period with a fracture of the navicular.   Five common patterns of injury were identified and classified according   to the radiological features. Type 1 fractures are dorsal avulsion   <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es related to the capsule of the talonavicular joint. Type   2 fractures are isolated avulsion <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es to the tuberosity of   the navicular. Type 3 fractures are a variant of tarsometatarsal   fracture/dislocations creating instability of the medial ray. Type   4 fractures involve the body of the navicular with no associated   injury to the lateral column and type 5 fractures occur in conjunction   with disruption of the midtarsal joint with crushing of the medial   or lateral, or both, columns of the foot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In order to test the reliability and reproducibility of this   new classification, a cohort of 30 patients with a fracture of the   navicular were classified by six independent assessors at two separate   times, six months apart.

Targeting Chondroitin Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis in Pathological Remodeling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, and the search for novel therapeutic approaches continues. In the monogenic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e mucopolysaccharidosis VI, loss-of-function mutations in arylsulfatase B lead to myocardial accumulation of chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycans, manifesting as myriad cardiac symptoms. Here, we studied changes in myocardial CS in nonmucopolysaccharidosis failing hearts and assessed its generic role in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical cardiac remodeling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Healthy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed human and rat left ventricles were subjected to histological and immunostaining methods to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>e glycosaminoglycan distribution. Glycosaminoglycans were extracted and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed for quantitative and compositional changes with Alcian blue assay and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Expression changes in 20 CS-related genes were studied in 3 primary human cardiac cell types and THP-1–derived macrophages under each of 9 in vitro stimulatory conditions. In 2 rat models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical remodeling induced by transverse aortic constriction or isoprenaline infusion, recombinant human arylsulfatase B (rhASB), clinically used as enzyme replacement therapy in mucopolysaccharidosis VI, was administered intravenously for 7 or 5 weeks, respectively. Cardiac function, myocardial fibrosis, and inflammation were assessed by echocardiography and histology. CS-interacting molecules were assessed with surface plasmon resonance, and a mechanism of action was verified in vitro.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Failing human hearts displayed significant perivascular and interstitial CS accumulation, particularly in regions of intense fibrosis. Relative composition of CS disaccharides remained unchanged. Transforming growth factor–β induced CS upregulation in cardiac fibroblasts. CS accumulation was also observed in both the pressure-overload and the isoprenaline models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical remodeling in rats. Early treatment with rhASB in the transverse aortic constriction model and delayed treatment in the isoprenaline model proved rhASB to be effective at preventing cardiac deterioration and augmenting functional recovery. Functional improvement was accompanied by reduced myocardial inflammation and overall fibrosis. Tumor necrosis factor–α was identified as a direct binding partner of CS glycosaminoglycan chains, and rhASB reduced tumor necrosis factor–α—induced inflammatory gene activation in vitro in endothelial cells and macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CS glycosaminoglycans accumulate during cardiac <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical remodeling and mediate myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. rhASB targets CS effectively as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of heart failure.</p></sec>

Functional Metabolomics Characterizes a Key Role for <i>N</i>-Acetylneuraminic Acid in Coronary Artery Diseases

Functional metabolomics aims to translate metabolomics-derived <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>ers to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A cohort of 2324 patients who underwent coronary angiography from 4 independent centers was studied. A combination of ultra–performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode was used for untargeted analysis of metabolites in plasma. Significant differential metabolites were identified by cross-comparisons with and within CAD types, including normal coronary artery, nonobstructvie coronary atherosclerosis, stable angina, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction. A tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry–based approach using isotope-labeled standard addition was subsequently performed for targeted analysis of the metabolic marker <i>N</i>-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). A functional metabolomics strategy was proposed to investigate the role of Neu5Ac in the progression of CAD by using in vitro and in vivo models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified a total of 36 differential metabolites, 35 of which were confirmed with reference compounds. Elevation of Neu5Ac was observed in plasma during CAD progression in center 1 (<i>P</i>=4.0e-64, n=2019) and replicated in 3 independent centers (n=305). The increased level of Neu5Ac in plasma was confirmed by accurate targeted quantification. Mechanistically, Neu5Ac was able to trigger myocardial injury in vitro and in vivo by activation of the Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase signaling pathway through binding to RhoA and Cdc42, but not Rac1. Silencing neuraminidase-1, the enzyme that regulates Neu5Ac generation, ameliorated oxygen-glucose deprivation–induced injury in cardiomyocytes and ligation/isoprenaline-induced myocardial ischemia injury in rats. Pharmacological inhibition of neuraminidase by anti-influenza drugs, oseltamivir and zanamivir, also protected cardiomyocytes and the heart from myocardial injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Functional metabolomics identified a key role for Neu5Ac in acute myocardial infarction, and targeting neuraminidase-1 may represent an unrecognized therapeutic intervention for CAD.</p></sec>

Tomo-Seq Identifies SOX9 as a Key Regulator of Cardiac Fibrosis During Ischemic Injury
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Cardiac ischemic injury induces a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical remodeling response, which can ultimately lead to heart failure. Detailed mechanistic insights into molecular signaling pathways relevant for different aspects of cardiac remodeling will support the identification of novel therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Although genome-wide transcriptome analysis on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed tissues has greatly advanced our understanding of the regulatory networks that drive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical changes in the heart, this approach has been disadvantaged by the fact that the signals are derived from tissue homogenates. Here we used tomo-seq to obtain a genome-wide gene expression signature with high spatial resolution spanning from the infarcted area to the remote to identify new regulators of cardiac remodeling. Cardiac tissue samples from patients suffering from ischemic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e were used to validate our findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Tracing transcriptional differences with a high spatial resolution across the infarcted heart enabled us to identify gene clusters that share a comparable expression profile. The spatial distribution patterns indicated a separation of expressional changes for genes involved in specific aspects of cardiac remodeling, such as fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and calcium handling (<i>Col1a2</i>, <i>Nppa</i>, and <i>Serca2</i>). Subsequent correlation analysis allowed for the identification of novel factors that share a comparable transcriptional regulation pattern across the infarcted tissue. The strong correlation between the expression levels of these known marker genes and the expression of the coregulated genes could be confirmed in human ischemic cardiac tissue samples. Follow-up analysis identified SOX9 as common transcriptional regulator of a large portion of the fibrosis-related genes that become activated under conditions of ischemic injury. Lineage-tracing experiments indicated that the majority of COL1-positive fibroblasts stem from a pool of SOX9-expressing cells, and in vivo loss of <i>Sox9</i> blunted the cardiac fibrotic response on ischemic injury. The colocalization between SOX9 and COL1 could also be confirmed in patients suffering from ischemic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Based on the exact local expression cues, tomo-seq can serve to reveal novel genes and key transcription factors involved in specific aspects of cardiac remodeling.

Predator-driven natural selection on risk-taking behavior in anole lizards
<p>Biologists have long debated the role of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> in evolution, yet understanding of its role as a driver of adaptation is hampered by the scarcity of experimental studies of natural selection on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> in nature. After showing that individual <i>Anolis sagrei</i> lizards vary consistently in risk-taking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s, we experimentally established populations on eight small islands either with or without <i>Leiocephalus carinatus</i>, a major ground predator. We found that selection predictably favors different risk-taking <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s under different treatments: Exploratory <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> is favored in the absence of predators, whereas avoidance of the ground is favored in their presence. On predator islands, selection on <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> is stronger than selection on morphology, whereas the opposite holds on islands without predators. Our field experiment demonstrates that selection can shape <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al traits, paving the way toward adaptation to varying environmental contexts.</p>

Single-Cell Sequencing of the Healthy and Diseased Heart Reveals Cytoskeleton-Associated Protein 4 as a New Modulator of Fibroblasts Activation
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Genome-wide transcriptome analysis has greatly advanced our understanding of the regulatory networks underlying basic cardiac biology and mechanisms driving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. However, so far, the resolution of studying gene expression patterns in the adult heart has been limited to the level of extracts from whole tissues. The use of tissue homogenates inherently causes the loss of any information on cellular origin or cell type-specific changes in gene expression. Recent developments in RNA amplification strategies provide a unique opportunity to use small amounts of input RNA for genome-wide sequencing of single cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Here, we present a method to obtain high-quality RNA from digested cardiac tissue from adult mice for automated single-cell sequencing of both the healthy and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed heart.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>After optimization, we were able to perform single-cell sequencing on adult cardiac tissue under both homeostatic conditions and after ischemic injury.

Furthermore, applying single-cell sequencing on both the healthy and injured heart indicated the presence of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-specific cell subpopulations. As such, we identified cytoskeleton-associated protein 4 as a novel marker for activated fibroblasts that positively correlates with known myofibroblast markers in both mouse and human cardiac tissue.

Novel Adipokine, FAM19A5, Inhibits Neointima Formation After Injury Through Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor 2
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Obesity plays crucial roles in the development of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. However, the mechanisms that link obesity and cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es remain elusive. Compelling evidence indicates that adipokines play an important role in obesity-related cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. Here, we found a new adipokine-named family with sequence similarity 19, member A5 (FAM19A5), a protein with unknown function that was predicted to be distantly related to the CC-chemokine family. We aimed to test whether adipose-derived FAM19A5 regulates vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>y on injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>DNA cloning, protein expression, purification, and N-terminal sequencing were applied to characterize FAM19A5. Adenovirus infection and siRNA transfection were performed to regulate FAM19A5 expression. Balloon and wire injury were performed in vivo on the rat carotid arteries and mouse femoral arteries, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis, radioactive ligand-receptor binding assays, receptor internalization, and calcium mobilization assays were used to identify the functional receptor for FAM19A5.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We first characterized FAM19A5 as a secreted protein, and the first 43 N-terminal amino acids were the signal peptides. Both FAM19A5 mRNA and protein were abundantly expressed in the adipose tissue but were downregulated in obese mice. Overexpression of FAM19A5 markedly inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration and neointima formation in the carotid arteries of balloon-injured rats. Accordingly, FAM19A5 silencing in adipocytes significantly promoted vascular smooth muscle cell activation. Adipose-specific FAM19A5 transgenic mice showed greater attenuation of neointima formation compared with wild-type littermates fed with or without Western-style diet. We further revealed that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 was the functional receptor for FAM19A5, with a dissociation constant (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub>) of 0.634 nmol/L. Inhibition of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 or its downstream G12/13-RhoA signaling circumvented the suppressive effects of FAM19A5 on vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We revealed that a novel adipokine, FAM19A5, was capable of inhibiting postinjury neointima formation via sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2-G12/13-RhoA signaling.

CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> Mononuclear Phagocytes Orchestrate Autoimmune Cardiac Valve Inflammation and Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Valvular heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e is common and affects the mitral valve (MV) most frequently. Despite the prevalence of MV <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (MVD), the cellular and molecular pathways that initiate and perpetuate it are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>K/B.g7 T-cell receptor transgenic mice spontaneously develop systemic autoantibody-associated autoimmunity, leading to fully penetrant fibroinflammatory MVD and arthritis. We used multiparameter flow cytometry, intracellular cytokine staining, and immunofluorescent staining to characterize the cells in inflamed K/B.g7 MVs. We used genetic approaches to study the contribution of mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) to MVD in this model. Specifically, we generated K/B.g7 mice in which either CX3CR1 or CD301b/macrophage galactose <i>N</i>-acetylgalactosamine–specific lectin 2 (MGL2)–expressing MNPs were ablated. Using K/B.g7 mice expressing <i>Cx3Cr1</i>-Cre, we conditionally deleted critical inflammatory molecules from MNPs, including the Fc-receptor signal-transducing tyrosine kinase Syk and the cell adhesion molecule very late antigen–4. We performed complementary studies using monoclonal antibodies to block key inflammatory molecules. We generated bone marrow chimeric mice to define the origin of the inflammatory cells present in the MV and to determine which valve cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Finally, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed specimens from patients with rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e to correlate our findings to human <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>y.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>MNPs comprised the vast majority of MV-infiltrating cells; these MNPs expressed CX3CR1 and CD301b/MGL2. Analogous cells were present in human rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e valves. K/B.g7 mice lacking CX3CR1 or in which CD301b/MGL2-expressing MNPs were ablated were protected from MVD. The valve-infiltrating CD301b/MGL2<sup>+</sup> MNPs expressed tissue-reparative molecules including arginase-1 and resistin-like molecule α. These MNPs also expressed the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and interleukin-6, and antibody blockade of these cytokines prevented MVD. Deleting Syk from CX3CR1-expressing MNPs reduced their TNF and interleukin-6 production and also prevented MVD.

Particulate Matter Air Pollution Exposure and Heart Disease Mortality Risks by Race and Ethnicity in the United States
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Most US studies of mortality and air pollution have been conducted on largely non-Hispanic white study populations. However, many health and mortality outcomes differ by race and ethnicity, and non-Hispanic white persons experience lower air pollution exposure than those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic. This study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>es whether associations between air pollution and heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e mortality differ by race/ethnicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We used data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Survey linked to mortality records through December 2011 and annual estimates of fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) by census tract.

Cardioprotective Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Factor 2 by Suppressing Apoptosis and Necroptosis

Clinical Outcomes in 3343 Children and Adults With Rheumatic Heart Disease From 14 Low- and Middle-Income Countries
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>There are few contemporary data on the mortality and morbidity associated with rheumatic heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e or information on their predictors.

Two-thirds were female. Although patients were young (median age, 28 years; interquartile range, 18–40), the 2-year case fatality rate was high (500 deaths, 16.9%). Mortality rate was 116.3/1000 patient-years in the first year and 65.4/1000 patient-years in the second year. Median age at death was 28.7 years. Independent predictors of death were severe valve <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (hazard ratio [HR], 2.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80–3.11), congestive heart failure (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.70–2.72), New York Heart Association functional class III/IV (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.32–2.10), atrial fibrillation (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.10–1.78), and older age (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01–1.02 per year increase) at enrollment.

Late Outcomes of Mitral Valve Repair for Mitral Regurgitation Due to Degenerative Disease
<sec><title>Background—</title><p>The <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical spectrum of degenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es of the mitral valve (MV) that causes mitral regurgitation (MR) is broad, and there is limited information on late outcomes of MV repair in various subgroups of patients and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ies. This study <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>es this issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results—</title><p>All 840 patients who had MV repair for MR due to degenerative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es from 1985 to 2004 were prospectively followed with clinical and echocardiographic evaluations at biennial intervals up to 26 years, median of 10.4 years. Clinical, hemodynamic, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical variables were evaluated for their association with outcomes. Age, left ventricular ejection fraction, and functional class were predictors of late cardiac- and valve-related deaths by multivariable analysis. MV repair failed to restore life span to normal in patients with functional class IV. Thirty-eight patients had repeat MV surgery, and the probability of reoperation at 20 years was 5.9%. During the follow-up, recurrent severe MR developed in 37 patients, and moderate MR developed in 61. Age, isolated prolapse of the anterior leaflet, the degree of myxomatous changes in the MV, lack of mitral annuloplasty, and duration of cardiopulmonary bypass were associated with increased risk of recurrent MR. At 20 years, the freedom from recurrent severe MR was 90.7%, and the freedom from moderate or severe MR was 69.2%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions—</title><p>MV repair for degenerative MR restored life span to normal except in patients with symptoms at rest and impaired left ventricular function.

DDiT4L promotes autophagy and inhibits pathological cardiac hypertrophy in response to stress
<p>Physiological cardiac hypertrophy, in response to stimuli such as exercise, is considered adaptive and beneficial. In contrast, <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical cardiac hypertrophy that arises in response to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical stimuli such as unrestrained high blood pressure and oxidative or metabolic stress is maladaptive and may precede heart failure. We found that the transcript encoding DNA damage–inducible transcript 4-like (DDiT4L) was expressed in murine models of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical cardiac hypertrophy but not in those of physiological cardiac hypertrophy. In cardiomyocytes, DDiT4L localized to early endosomes and promoted stress-induced autophagy through a process involving mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Exposing cardiomyocytes to various types of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical stress increased the abundance of <i>DDiT4L</i>, which inhibited mTORC1 but activated mTORC2 signaling. Mice with conditional cardiac-specific overexpression of DDiT4L had mild systolic dysfunction, increased baseline autophagy, reduced mTORC1 activity, and increased mTORC2 activity, all of which were reversed by suppression of transgene expression. Genetic suppression of autophagy also reversed cardiac dysfunction in these mice. Our data showed that DDiT4L may be an important transducer of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>ical stress to autophagy through mTOR signaling in the heart and that DDiT4L could be therapeutically targeted in cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es in which autophagy and mTOR signaling play a major role.</p>

Understanding Lassa fever
<p>Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever prevalent in West Africa that has been gaining international attention as an emerging infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e with the potential to cause epidemics (<i>1</i>). Confirmed and suspected cases of Lassa fever have been steadily rising in Nigeria over the past 3 years. Laboratory-confirmed cases have increased from 106 in 2016 to 143 in 2017 and had already reached 562 by November 2018 (<i>2</i>). Part of defining the scope of the problem is trying to assess whether this is a true increase in the number of people afflicted by the infection, due to either changes in the virus itself or the geographical spread of the vector (rodents of the <i>Mastomys</i> spp.), or a reflection of higher rates of detection and diagnosis secondary to the increased attention and interest of clinicians and laboratorians (<i>1</i>). Lassa fever outbreaks illustrate the issues associated with the response and management of emerging infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es: How do you plan the public health, clinical, and community responses to a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e while you are still learning about the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and the ecological factors contributing to the spread of the pathogen? On page 74 of this issue, Kafetzopoulou <i>et al.</i> (<i>3</i>) present the results of a rapid genomic study of Lassa virus (LASV) from the cases of 2018, which have improved understanding of how the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e has been spreading in Nigeria and have led to informed and targeted <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-control strategies. The study also further describes the use of a new and compact genomic sequencing device, which may start playing a larger role in defining other emerging infectious <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e outbreaks in real time.</p>

Transcriptome-wide isoform-level dysregulation in ASD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder
<p>Most genetic risk for psychiatric <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e lies in regulatory regions, implicating pathogenic dysregulation of gene expression and splicing. However, comprehensive assessments of transcriptomic organization in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>ed brains are limited. In this work, we integrated genotypes and RNA sequencing in brain samples from 1695 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, as well as controls. More than 25% of the transcriptome exhibits differential splicing or expression, with isoform-level changes capturing the largest <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e effects and genetic enrichments. Coexpression networks isolate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-specific neuronal alterations, as well as microglial, astrocyte, and interferon-response modules defining previously unidentified neural-immune mechanisms. We integrated genetic and genomic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study, prioritizing <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e loci likely mediated by cis effects on brain expression. This transcriptome-wide characterization of the molecular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>y across three major psychiatric disorders provides a comprehensive resource for mechanistic insight and therapeutic development.</p>

Connecting neuronal circuits for movement
<p>Movement is the most common final output of nervous system activity and is essential for survival. But what makes this seemingly trivial statement so scientifically challenging? Neurons that contribute to when and how our body moves are distributed throughout the nervous system. Thus, even a simple movement such as arm flexion requires the coordinated activation of many different neuronal populations across multiple brain regions. A key question is how the nervous system produces diverse and precise actions aligned with the organisms' <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al needs. These processes are affected in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es such as Parkinson's or Huntington's, in which aberrant motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> dominates. Recent studies are transformative in how we think about the control of movement. A common denominator of these studies is that brain regions that contribute to motor <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> can no longer be considered as interacting boxes. Instead, deep circuit-level insight based on specific neuronal populations emerges as being critical to revealing motor system organization and understanding its function. It is likely that insights at this level can also help to design more specific and direct interventions for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es of the motor system and neuroprosthetics applied after <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es.</p>

Phenotype risk scores identify patients with unrecognized Mendelian disease patterns
<p>Genetic association studies often <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>e features independently, potentially missing subpopulations with multiple phenotypes that share a single cause. We describe an approach that aggregates phenotypes on the basis of patterns described by Mendelian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. We mapped the clinical features of 1204 Mendelian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es into phenotypes captured from the electronic health record (EHR) and summarized this evidence as phenotype risk scores (PheRSs). In an initial validation, PheRS distinguished cases and controls of five Mendelian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. Applying PheRS to 21,701 genotyped individuals uncovered 18 associations between rare variants and phenotypes consistent with Mendelian <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. In 16 patients, the rare genetic variants were associated with severe outcomes such as organ transplants. PheRS can augment rare-variant interpretation and may identify subsets of patients with distinct genetic causes for common <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es.</p>

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
<i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> Induces the Expression of a MicroRNA to Suppress the Immune Response in Rice
<p>MicroRNAs play crucial roles in plant responses to pathogen infections. The rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, caused by the fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i>, is the most important <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>). To explore the microRNA species that participate in rice immunity against the rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, we compared the expression of small RNAs between mock- and <i>M. oryzae</i>-treated rice. We found that infection by <i>M. oryzae</i> strain Guy11 specifically induced the expression of rice miR319 and, consequently, suppressed its target gene <i>TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR1</i> (<i>OsTCP21</i>), which encodes a transcription factor. Using transgenic rice that overexpresses miR319b (OE) or expresses <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res (which is resistant to miR319-mediated silencing), we found that <i>OsTCP21</i> is a positive regulator of the rice defense response against the blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. When wild-type and miR319b-OE rice were infected by Guy11, multiple jasmonic acid (JA) synthetic and signaling components were suppressed, indicating that Guy11 suppresses JA signaling through inducing miR319. In particular, we found that <i>LIPOXYGENASE2</i> (<i>LOX2</i>) and <i>LOX5</i> were specifically suppressed by miR319 overexpression or by Guy11 infection. LOXs are the key enzymes of JA synthesis, which catalyze the conversion of α-linoleic acid to hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid. The application of α-linoleic acid rescued <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e symptoms on the <i>OsTCP21</i>-Res rice but not wild-type rice, supporting our hypothesis that <i>OsLOX2</i> and <i>OsLOX5</i> are the key JA synthesis genes hijacked by Guy11 to subvert host immunity and facilitate pathogenicity. We propose that induced expression of <i>OsLOX2/5</i> may improve resistance to the rice blast <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

Neurohormonal changes associated with ritualized combat and the formation of a reproductive hierarchy in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>
<p>Dominance rank in animal societies is correlated with changes in both reproductive physiology and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. In some social insects, dominance status is used to determine a reproductive division of labor, where a few colony members reproduce while most remain functionally sterile. Changes in reproduction and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> in this context must be coordinated through crosstalk between the brain and the reproductive system. We investigated a role for biogenic amines in forming this connection in the ant <i>Harpegnathos saltator</i>. In this species, workers engage in an elaborate dominance tournament to establish a group of reproductive workers termed gamergates. We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed biogenic amine content in the brains of gamergates, inside-workers and foragers under stable colony conditions and found that gamergates had the highest levels of dopamine. Dopamine levels were also positively correlated with increased ovarian activity among gamergates. Next, we experimentally induced workers to compete in a reproductive tournament to determine how dopamine may be involved in the establishment of a new hierarchy. Dopamine levels rose in aggressive workers at the start of a tournament, while workers that were policed by their nestmates (a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> that inhibits ovarian activity) showed a rapid decline in dopamine. In addition to dopamine, levels of serotonin and tyramine differed among castes, and these changes could contribute to differences in caste-specific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al patterns observed among non-reproductive workers. Overall, these results provide support that biogenic amines link changes in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong> and dominance with reproductive activity in <i>H. saltator</i> as well as drive differences in worker task performance.</p>

Intra- and interspecific challenges modulate cortisol but not androgen levels in a year-round territorial damselfish
<p>Interactions between individuals of different species are commonplace in animal communities. Some <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s displayed during these interspecific social interactions may be very similar to those displayed during intraspecific social interactions. However, whether functional analogies between intra- and interspecific <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s translate at the proximate level into an overlap in their underlying endocrine mechanisms remains largely unknown. Because steroids both mediate social <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>s and respond to them, we approached this question by comparing the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al and steroid response of free-living dusky gregories (<i>Stegastes nigricans</i>) to standardized territorial intrusions (sTI) of either conspecific or heterospecific food competitors. <i>Stegastes nigricans</i> is a year-round territorial fish that ‘cultivates’ the algae on which it feeds and is highly aggressive to both intra- and interspecific intruders. <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>al differences between intra- and interspecific aggressive responses to sTI were marginal, and sTI tests caused an increase in cortisol levels that was positively related with the levels of aggression. In contrast, androgen levels did not increase in response to sTI, yet they showed a positive relationship with agonistic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">behavior</span></strong>. These results parallel a pattern that was first described for year-round territorial bird species. Furthermore, they suggest that changes in endocrine-hormone levels during territoriality might be independent of the species that induces the territorial response.</p>

The long-term clinical and radiological outcomes in patients who suffer recurrent injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament after reconstruction
<sec><title>Aims</title><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term clinical   and radiological outcome of patients who suffer recurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es   to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) after reconstruction and   require revision surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>From a consecutive series of 200 patients who underwent primary   reconstruction following rupture of the ACL, we identified 36 who   sustained a further rupture, 29 of whom underwent revision surgery.   Patients were reviewed prospectively at one, two, seven, 15 and   about 20 years after their original surgery. Primary outcome measures   were the number of further ruptures, the posterior tibial slope   (PTS), and functional and radiological outcomes. These were compared   with a gender and age matched cohort of patients who underwent primary   ACL reconstruction only.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At a mean follow-up of 18.3 years (14.3 to 20.2), 29 patients   had undergone revision surgery and within this revision group 11   had sustained more than three ruptures of the ACL (3 to 6). The   mean age at the time of revision reconstruction was 26.4 years (14   to 54). The mean PTS was significantly higher in those patients   who suffered a further injury to the ACL (11°) compared with the   control group (9°) (p < 0.001). The mean PTS in those patients   who sustained more than three ruptures was 12°.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients who suffer recurrent <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es to the ACL after reconstruction   have poorer functional and radiological outcomes than those who   suffer a single injury.

Axon degeneration and PGC-1α-mediated protection in a zebrafish model of α-synuclein toxicity
<p>α-synuclein (aSyn) expression is implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including Parkinson’s <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In animal models of these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es, axon <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>y often precedes cell death, raising the question of whether aSyn has compartment-specific toxic effects that could require early and/or independent therapeutic intervention. The relevance of axonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>y to degeneration can only be addressed through longitudinal, <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of different neuronal compartments. With current imaging methods, dopaminergic neurons do not readily lend themselves to such a task in any vertebrate system. We therefore expressed human wild-type aSyn in zebrafish peripheral sensory neurons, which project elaborate superficial axons that can be continuously imaged <i>in vivo</i>. Axonal outgrowth was normal in these neurons but, by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), many aSyn-expressing axons became dystrophic, with focal varicosities or diffuse beading. Approximately 20% of aSyn-expressing cells died by 3 dpf. Time-lapse imaging revealed that focal axonal swelling, but not overt fragmentation, usually preceded cell death. Co-expressing aSyn with a mitochondrial reporter revealed deficits in mitochondrial transport and morphology even when axons appeared overtly normal. The axon-protective protein Wallerian degeneration slow (WldS) delayed axon degeneration but not cell death caused by aSyn. By contrast, the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α, which has roles in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and reactive-oxygen-species detoxification, abrogated aSyn toxicity in both the axon and the cell body. The rapid onset of axonal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">patholog</span></strong>y in this system, and the relatively moderate degree of cell death, provide a new model for the study of aSyn toxicity and protection. Moreover, the accessibility of peripheral sensory axons will allow effects of aSyn to be studied in different neuronal compartments and might have utility in screening for novel <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e-modifying compounds.</p>

Disease Models & Mechanisms
Pharmacological preconditioning with erythropoietin attenuates the organ injury and dysfunction induced in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock
<p>Pre-treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) has been demonstrated to exert tissue-protective effects against ‘ischemia-reperfusion’-type <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">injuri</span></strong>es. This protection might be mediated by mobilization of bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are thought to secrete paracrine factors. These effects could be exploited to protect against tissue injury induced in cases where hemorrhage is foreseeable, for example, prior to major surgery. Here, we investigate the effects of EPO pre-treatment on the organ injury and dysfunction induced by hemorrhagic shock (HS). Recombinant human EPO (1000 IU/kg/day i.p.) was administered to rats for 3 days. Rats were subjected to HS on day 4 (pre-treatment protocol). Mean arterial pressure was reduced to 35±5 mmHg for 90 minutes, followed by resuscitation with 20 ml/kg Ringer’s lactate for 10 minutes and 50% of the shed blood for 50 minutes. Rats were sacrificed 4 hours after the onset of resuscitation. EPC (CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cell) mobilization was measured following the 3-day pre-treatment with EPO and was significantly increased compared with rats pre-treated with phosphate-buffered saline. EPO pre-treatment significantly attenuated organ injury and dysfunction (renal, hepatic and neuromuscular) caused by HS. In livers from rats subjected to HS, EPO enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt (activation), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β; inhibition) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS; activation). In the liver, HS also caused an increase in nuclear translocation of p65 (activation of NF-κB), which was attenuated by EPO. This data suggests that repetitive dosing with EPO prior to injury might protect against the organ injury and dysfunction induced by HS, by a mechanism that might involve mobilization of CD34<sup>+</sup>/flk-1<sup>+</sup> cells, resulting in the activation of the Akt-eNOS survival pathway and inhibition of activation of GSK-3β and NF-κB.</p>

Impact of Novel Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol Assessment on the Utility of Secondary Non-High-Density Lipoprotein-C and Apolipoprotein B Targets in Selected Worldwide Dyslipidemia Guidelines
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Selected dyslipidemia guidelines recommend non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) as secondary targets to the primary target of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). After considering 2 LDL-C estimates that differ in accuracy, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed: (1) how frequently non-HDL-C guideline targets could change management; and (2) the utility of apoB targets after meeting LDL-C and non-HDL-C targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed 2518 adults representative of the US population from the 2011 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ation Survey and 126 092 patients from the Very Large Database of Lipids study with apoB. We identified all individuals as well as those with high-risk clinical features, including coronary artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome who met very high- and high-risk guideline targets of LDL-C <70 and <100 mg/dL using Friedewald estimation (LDL-C<sub>F</sub>) and a novel, more accurate method (LDL-C<sub>N</sub>). Next, we <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">examin</span></strong>ed those not meeting non-HDL-C (<100, <130 mg/dL) and apoB (<80, <100 mg/dL) guideline targets. In those meeting dual LDL-C and non-HDL-C targets (<70 and <100 mg/dL, respectively, or <100 and <130 mg/dL, respectively), we determined the proportion of individuals who did not meet guideline apoB targets (<80 or <100 mg/dL).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 7% to 9% and 31% to 36% of individuals had LDL-C <70 and <100 mg/dL, respectively. Among those with LDL-C<sub>F</sub><70 mg/dL, 14% to 15% had non-HDL-C ≥100 mg/dL, and 7% to 8% had apoB ≥80 mg/dL. Among those with LDL-C<sub>F</sub><100 mg/dL, 8% to 10% had non-HDL-C ≥130 mg/dL and 2% to 3% had apoB ≥100 mg/dL. In comparison, among those with LDL-C<sub>N</sub><70 or 100 mg/dL, only ≈2% and ≈1% of individuals, respectively, had non-HDL-C and apoB values above guideline targets. Similar trends were upheld among those with high-risk clinical features: ≈0% to 3% of individuals with LDL-C<sub>N</sub><70 mg/dL had non-HDL-C ≥100 mg/dL or apoB ≥80 mg/dL compared with 13% to 38% and 9% to 25%, respectively, in those with LDL-C<sub>F</sub><70 mg/dL. With LDL-C<sub>F</sub> or LDL-C<sub>N</sub><70 mg/dL and non-HDL-C <100 mg/dL, 0% to 1% had apoB ≥80 mg/dL. Among all dual LDL-C<sub>F</sub> or LDL-C<sub>N</sub><100 mg/dL and non-HDL-C <130 mg/dL individuals, 0% to 0.4% had apoB ≥100 mg/dL. These findings were robust to sex, fasting status, and lipid-lowering therapy status.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>After more accurately estimating LDL-C, guideline-suggested non-HDL-C targets could alter management in only a small fraction of individuals, including those with coronary artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and other high-risk clinical features.

Genetic Architecture of the Cardiovascular Risk Proteome

Here we hypothesized that performing genome-wide association studies and exome array analyses on the levels of each of these 156 proteins might identify genetic determinants of risk-associated circulating factors and provide insights into early cardiovascular pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We studied the association of genetic variants with the plasma levels of each of the 156 Framingham Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e Risk Score–associated proteins using linear mixed-effects models in 2 population-based cohorts. We performed discovery analyses on plasma samples from 759 participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, an observational study of the offspring of the original Framingham Heart Study and their spouses, and validated these findings in plasma samples from 1421 participants of the MDCS (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study). To evaluate the utility of this strategy in identifying new biological pathways relevant to cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e pathophysiology, we performed studies in a cell-model system to experimentally validate the functional significance of an especially novel genetic association with circulating apolipoprotein E levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>We identified 120 locus-protein associations in genome-wide analyses and 41 associations in exome array analyses, the majority of which have not been described previously. These loci explained up to 66% of interindividual plasma protein-level variation and, on average, accounted for 3 times the amount of variation explained by common clinical factors, such as age, sex, and diabetes mellitus status. We described overlap among many of these loci and cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e genetic risk variants. Finally, we experimentally validated a novel association between circulating apolipoprotein E levels and the transcription factor phosphatase 1G. Knockdown of phosphatase 1G in a human liver cell model resulted in decreased apolipoprotein E transcription and apolipoprotein E protein levels in cultured supernatants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>We identified dozens of novel genetic determinants of proteins associated with the Framingham Cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e Risk Score and experimentally validated a new role for phosphatase 1G in lipoprotein biology.

Fibroblast-Specific Genetic Manipulation of p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase In Vivo Reveals Its Central Regulatory Role in Fibrosis
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>In the heart, acute injury induces a fibrotic healing response that generates collagen-rich scarring that is at first protective but if inappropriately sustained can worsen heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. The fibrotic process is initiated by cytokines, neuroendocrine effectors, and mechanical strain that promote resident fibroblast differentiation into contractile and extracellular matrix–producing myofibroblasts. The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α (<i>Mapk14</i> gene) is known to influence the cardiac injury response, but its direct role in orchestrating programmed fibroblast differentiation and fibrosis in vivo is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A conditional <i>Mapk14</i> allele was used to delete the p38α encoding gene specifically in cardiac fibroblasts or myofibroblasts with 2 different tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase–expressing gene–targeted mouse lines. Mice were subjected to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation and monitored for survival, cardiac function, and fibrotic remodeling. Antithetically, mice with fibroblast-specific transgenic overexpression of activated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6, a direct inducer of p38, were generated to investigate whether this pathway can directly drive myofibroblast formation and the cardiac fibrotic response.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In mice, loss of <i>Mapk14</i> blocked cardiac fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts and ensuing fibrosis in response to ischemic injury or chronic neurohumoral stimulation. A similar inhibition of myofibroblast formation and healing was also observed in a dermal wounding model with deletion of <i>Mapk14</i>. Transgenic mice with fibroblast-specific activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6–p38 developed interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in the heart, lung, and kidney as a result of enhanced myofibroblast numbers. Mechanistic experiments show that p38 transduces cytokine and mechanical signals into myofibroblast differentiation through the transcription factor serum response factor and the signaling effector calcineurin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These findings suggest that signals from diverse modes of injury converge on p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase within the fibroblast to program the fibrotic response and myofibroblast formation in vivo, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach with p38 inhibitors for future clinical application.</p></sec>

Antibody-Mediated Inhibition of Tspan12 Ameliorates Vasoproliferative Retinopathy Through Suppression of β-Catenin Signaling
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Anti-angiogenic biologicals represent an important concept for the treatment of vasoproliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es. However, the need for continued treatment, the presence of nonresponders, and the risk of long-term side effects limit the success of existing therapeutic agents. Although Tspan12 has been shown to regulate retinal vascular development, nothing is known about its involvement in neovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and its potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vasoproliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Rodent models of retinal neovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, including the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy and the very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model were <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed for Tspan/β-catenin regulation. Screening of a phage display of a human combinatorial antibody (Ab) library was used for the development of a high-affinity Ab against Tspan12. Therapeutic effects of the newly developed Ab on vascular endothelial cells were tested in vitro and in vivo in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor knockout mouse model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The newly developed anti-Tspan12 Ab exhibited potent inhibitory effects on endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the Ab inhibited the interaction between Tspan12 and Frizzled-4 and effectively modulates β-catenin levels and target genes in vascular endothelial cells. Tspan12/β-catenin signaling was activated in response to acute and chronic stress in the oxygen-induced retinopathy and very low density lipoprotein receptor mouse model of proliferative retinopathy. Intravitreal application of the Ab showed significant therapeutic effects in both models without inducing negative side effects on retina function. Moreover, combined intravitreal injection of the Ab with a known vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, Aflibercept, resulted in significant enhancement of the therapeutic efficacy of each monotherapy. Combination therapy with the Tspan12 blocking antibody can be used to reduce anti-vascular endothelial growth factor doses, thus decreasing the risk of long-term off-target effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Tspan12/β-catenin signaling is critical for the progression of vasoproliferative <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.

Phenotypic Characterization of <i>EIF2AK4</i> Mutation Carriers in a Large Cohort of Patients Diagnosed Clinically With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e with an emerging genetic basis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (<i>BMPR2</i>) are the commonest genetic cause of PAH, whereas biallelic mutations in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (<i>EIF2AK4</i>) are described in pulmonary veno-occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Here, we determine the frequency of these mutations and define the genotype-phenotype characteristics in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with PAH.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Whole-genome sequencing was performed on DNA from patients with idiopathic and heritable PAH and with pulmonary veno-occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis recruited to the National Institute of Health Research BioResource–Rare <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>es study. Heterozygous variants in <i>BMPR2</i> and biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> variants with a minor allele frequency of <1:10 000 in control data sets and predicted to be deleterious (by combined annotation-dependent depletion, PolyPhen-2, and <i>sorting intolerant from tolerant</i> predictions) were identified as potentially causal. Phenotype data from the time of diagnosis were also captured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Eight hundred sixty-four patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH and 16 with pulmonary veno-occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis were recruited.

Biallelic mutations in <i>EIF2AK4</i> were identified in 5 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e/pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis. Furthermore, 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PAH carried biallelic <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations. These patients had a reduced transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (K<sc>co</sc>; 33% [interquartile range, 30%–35%] predicted) and younger age at diagnosis (29 years; interquartile range, 23–38 years) and more interlobular septal thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography of the chest compared with patients with PAH without <i>EIF2AK4</i> mutations.

Median follow-up time was 12.6 (to a maximum of 28.2) years.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Fewer AF cases were observed in women (N=1796; 4.4%), than in men (N=2465; 6.4%). Cardiovascular risk factor distribution and lipid profile at baseline were less beneficial in men than in women, and cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e was more prevalent in men. Cumulative incidence increased markedly after the age of 50 years in men and after 60 years in women. The lifetime risk was similar (>30%) for both sexes.

Anti-Müllerian Hormone Trajectories Are Associated With Cardiovascular Disease in Women

However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship remain undetermined. Indications suggest that anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), an ovarian reserve marker, plays a physiological role outside of the reproductive system. Therefore, we investigated whether longitudinal AMH decline trajectories are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (CVD) occurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>This study included 3108 female participants between 20 and 60 years of age at baseline of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort. Participants completed ≥1 of 5 consecutive quinquennial visits between 1987 and 2010, resulting in a total follow-up time of 20 years. AMH was measured in 8507 stored plasma samples. Information on total CVD, stroke, and coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e was obtained through a hospital discharge registry linkage. The association of AMH trajectories with CVD was quantified with joint modeling, with adjustment for age, smoking, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone therapy use, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>By the end of follow-up, 8.2% of the women had suffered from CVD, 4.9% had suffered from coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, and 2.6% had experienced a stroke. After adjustment, each ng/mL lower <sub>log</sub>AMH level was associated with a 21% higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.36) and a 26% higher risk of coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–1.46). Each additional ng/mL/year decrease of <sub>log</sub>AMH was associated with a significantly higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–1.87) and coronary heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.12). No association between AMH and stroke was found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate that AMH trajectories in women are independently associated with CVD risk. Therefore, we postulate that the decline of circulating AMH levels may be part of the pathophysiology of the increased cardiovascular risk of earlier menopause. Confirmation of this association and elucidation of its underlying mechanisms are needed to place these results in a clinical perspective.</p></sec>

Prognostic Value of N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide, Troponin-T, and Growth-Differentiation Factor 15 in Adult Congenital Heart Disease
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>The number of patients with adult congenital heart <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e (ACHD) is rapidly increasing. To optimize patient management, there is a great need to accurately identify high-risk patients. Still, no <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>er has been firmly established as a clinically useful prognostic tool in this group. We studied the association of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 with cardiovascular events in ACHD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Clinically stable patients with ACHD who routinely visited the outpatient clinic between April 2011 and April 2013 underwent clinical assessment, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>er measurement (NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15) at the time of study inclusion. Patients were prospectively followed for the occurrence of cardiovascular events (death, heart failure, hospitalization, arrhythmia, thromboembolic events, and reintervention). Survival curves were derived by the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression was performed to investigate the relation between <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>ers and events with adjustment for multiple clinical and echocardiographic variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In total, 595 patients were included (median age, 33 years; interquartile range, 25–41 years; 58% male; 90% New York Heart Association class I). Patients were followed during a median of 42 (interquartile range, 37–46) months. Of the 3 evaluated <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>ers, NT-proBNP in the upper quartile (>33.3 pmol/L) was most strongly associated with cardiovascular events (n=165, adjusted hazard ratio, 9.05 [3.24–25.3], <i>P</i><0.001) and with death or heart failure (n=50, adjusted hazard ratio, 16.0 [2.04–126], <i>P</i><0.001). When NT-proBNP was <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">analyz</span></strong>ed as a continuous variable, similar findings were retrieved. The cumulative proportion of patients with death and heart failure was only 1% in the lowest 2 NT-proBNP quartiles. Elevated NT-proBNP (>14 pmol/L), elevated high-sensitive troponin-T (>14 ng/L), and elevated growth-differentiation factor 15 (>1109 ng/L) identified those patients at highest risk of cardiovascular events (log-rank <i>P</i><0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>NT-proBNP provides prognostic information beyond a conventional risk marker model in patients with ACHD and can reliably exclude the risk of death and heart failure. Elevated levels of NT-proBNP, high-sensitive troponin-T, and growth-differentiation factor 15 identify patients at highest risk of cardiovascular events. These <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">biomark</span></strong>ers therefore may play an important role in the monitoring and management of patients with ACHD.</p></sec>

Percutaneous Therapies for Peripheral Artery Disease
<p>Percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e continue to evolve with new techniques and devices. Although guidelines-recommended therapies have impacted cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, endovascular interventions have been shown to reduce limb pain, improve quality of life, and prolong walking distance for those with claudication and to reduce amputation rates among those with critical limb ischemia. Novel devices such as drug-eluting stents and drug-coated balloons have improved patency for moderate-length lesions, whereas others allow treatment of heavily calcified and tortuous segments. New adjunctive devices to cross lesions and reduce or modify associated plaque have also been developed, although level 1 data regarding their efficacy are sparse. There has also been a better mechanistic understanding of lower extremity endovascular treatment using tools such as intravascular ultrasound. This information has highlighted the need for better stent size selection for the femoropopliteal arterial segments and larger balloon diameters for the tibial arteries. Moreover, a wound perfusion approach with direct in-line flow, the so-called angiosome approach, and reconstruction of the pedal loop have been advocated for improved wound healing. Technical advances such as the tibiopedal access and reentry methods have allowed crossing of lesions that were considered no option for the endovascular approach in the past. Collectively, there has been increased awareness, interest, and commitment by various specialty societies and organizations to advance the treatment of peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e and critical limb ischemia. This is also evident by the recent coalition of 7 professional societies and organizations that represented >150 000 allied health professionals and millions of patients with peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e at the 2015 Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Analysis Committee meeting. The percutaneous therapies for peripheral artery <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e continue to evolve with longer follow-up with randomized data and larger prospective registries. In the future, it is hopeful that we will treat the lower extremity arteries according to segments, taking into account plaque morphology, luminal versus subintimal crossing, location, and stenotic versus occlusive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. Until then, we must identify the most cost-effective, efficacious, and safe treatment for each patient. The goal of this article is to aid the practicing vascular specialist consider the optimal choices for the management of patients with vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e.</p>

Distribution of Estimated 10-Year Risk of Recurrent Vascular Events and Residual Risk in a Secondary Prevention Population
<sec><title>Background:</title><p>Among patients with clinically manifest vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, the risk of recurrent vascular events is likely to vary. We assessed the distribution of estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events in a secondary prevention population. We also estimated the potential risk reduction and residual risk that can be achieved if patients reach guideline-recommended risk factor targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The SMART score (Second Manifestations of Arterial <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e) for 10-year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death was applied to 6904 patients with vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e. The risk score was externally validated in 18 436 patients with various manifestations of vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e from the TNT (Treating to New Targets), IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels), and CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events) trials. The residual risk at guideline-recommended targets was estimated by applying relative risk reductions from meta-analyses to the estimated risk for targets for systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, physical activity, and use of antithrombotic agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The external performance of the SMART risk score was reasonable, apart from overestimation of risk in patients with 10-year risk >40%. In patients with various manifestations of vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, median 10-year risk of a recurrent major vascular event was 17% (interquartile range, 11%–28%), varying from <10% in 18% to >30% in 22% of the patients. If risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, the residual 10-year risk would be <10% in 47% and >30% in 9% of the patients (median, 11%; interquartile range, 7%–17%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Among patients with vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e, there is very substantial variation in estimated 10-year risk of recurrent vascular events. If all modifiable risk factors were at guideline-recommended targets, half of the patients would have a 10-year risk <10%. These data suggest that even with optimal treatment, many patients with vascular <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">diseas</span></strong>e will remain at >20% and even >30% 10-year risk, clearly delineating an area of substantial unmet medical need.</p></sec>

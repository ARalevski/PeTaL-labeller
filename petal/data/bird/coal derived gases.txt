Methane production from coal by a single methanogen
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e is one of the largest unconventional natural gas resources. Although microbial activity may greatly contribute to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e formation, it is unclear whether the complex aromatic organic compounds present in <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong> can be used for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenesis. We show that deep subsurface–derived <i>Methermicoccus</i> <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogens can produce <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e from more than 30 types of methoxylated aromatic compounds (MACs) as well as from <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>s containing MACs. In contrast to known <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenesis pathways involving one- and two-carbon compounds, this “methoxydotrophic” mode of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenesis couples <i>O</i>-demethylation, CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, and possibly acetyl–coenzyme A metabolism. Because MACs derived from lignin may occur widely in subsurface sediments, methoxydotrophic <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ogenesis would play an important role in the formation of natural gas not limited to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">coal</span></strong>-bed <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e and in the global carbon cycle.</p>

Catalytic molten metals for the direct conversion of methane to hydrogen and separable carbon
<p>Metals that are active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e (Ni, Pt, Pd), when dissolved in inactive low–melting temperature metals (In, Ga, Sn, Pb), produce stable molten metal alloy <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s for pyrolysis of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e into hydrogen and carbon. All solid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s previously used for this reaction have been deactivated by carbon deposition. In the molten alloy system, the insoluble carbon floats to the surface where it can be skimmed off. A 27% Ni–73% Bi alloy achieved 95% <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e conversion at 1065°C in a 1.1-meter bubble column and produced pure hydrogen without CO<sub>2</sub> or other by-products. Calculations show that the active metals in the molten alloys are atomically dispersed and negatively charged. There is a correlation between the amount of charge on the atoms and their catalytic activity.</p>

Cobalt-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of enamides enabled by single-electron reduction
<p>Identifying <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> activation modes that exploit one-electron chemistry and overcome associated deactivation pathways will be transformative for developing first-row transition metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s with performance equal or, ideally, superior to precious metals. Here we describe a zinc-activation method compatible with high-throughput reaction discovery that identified scores of cobalt-phosphine combinations for the asymmetric hydrogenation of functionalized alkenes. An optimized <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> prepared from (<i>R</i>,<i>R</i>)-Ph-BPE {Ph-BPE, 1,2-bis[(2<i>R</i>,5<i>R</i>)-2,5-diphenylphospholano]ethane} and cobalt chloride [CoCl<sub>2</sub>·6H<sub>2</sub>O] exhibited high activity and enantioselectivity in protic media and enabled the asymmetric synthesis of the epilepsy medication levetiracetam at 200-gram scale with 0.08 mole % <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> loading. Stoichiometric studies established that the cobalt (II) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> precursor (<i>R</i>,<i>R</i>)-Ph-BPECoCl<sub>2</sub> underwent ligand displacement by <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol, and zinc promoted facile one-electron reduction to cobalt (I), which more stably bound the phosphine.</p>

Selective anaerobic oxidation of methane enables direct synthesis of methanol
<p>Direct functionalization of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e in natural gas remains a key challenge. We present a direct stepwise method for converting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e into <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol with high selectivity (~97%) over a copper-containing zeolite, based on partial oxidation with water. The activation in helium at 673 kelvin (K), followed by consecutive <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> exposures to 7 bars of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e and then water at 473 K, consistently produced 0.204 mole of CH<sub>3</sub>OH per mole of copper in zeolite. Isotopic labeling confirmed water as the source of oxygen to regenerate the zeolite active centers and renders <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol desorption energetically favorable. On the basis of in situ x-ray absorption spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, we propose a mechanism involving <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e oxidation at Cu<sup>II</sup> oxide active centers, followed by Cu<sup>I</sup> reoxidation by water with concurrent formation of hydrogen.</p>

Low-temperature activation of methane on the IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e undergoes highly facile C–H bond cleavage on the stoichiometric IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) surface. From temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy experiments, we found that <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e molecularly adsorbed as a strongly bound σ complex on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) and that a large fraction of the adsorbed complexes underwent C–H bond cleavage at temperatures as low as 150 kelvin (K). The initial dissociation probability of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110) decreased from 80 to 20% with increasing surface temperature from 175 to 300 K. We estimate that the activation energy for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e C–H bond cleavage is 9.5 kilojoule per mole (kJ/mol) lower than the binding energy of the adsorbed precursor on IrO<sub>2</sub>(110), and equal to a value of ~28.5 kJ/mol. Low-temperature activation may avoid unwanted side reactions in the development of catalytic processes to selectively convert <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e to value-added products.</p>

Identification of single-site gold catalysis in acetylene hydrochlorination

Particulate methane monooxygenase contains only mononuclear copper centers

The nature of the copper active site in the primary metabolic enzyme of these bacteria, particulate <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e monooxygenase (pMMO), has been controversial owing to seemingly contradictory biochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic results. We present biochemical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic characterization most consistent with two monocopper sites within pMMO: one in the soluble PmoB subunit at the previously assigned active site (Cu<sub>B</sub>) and one ~2 nanometers away in the membrane-bound PmoC subunit (Cu<sub>C</sub>). On the basis of these results, we propose that a monocopper site is able to catalyze <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e oxidation in pMMO.</p>

Entropy-driven stability of chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes
<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes are hollow cylinders that can grow centimeters long via carbon incorporation at the interface with a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>. They display semiconducting or metallic characteristics, depending on their helicity, which is determined during their growth. To support the quest for a selective synthesis, we develop a thermodynamic model that relates the tube-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> interfacial energies, temperature, and the resulting tube chirality. We show that nanotubes can grow chiral because of the configurational entropy of their nanometer-sized edge, thus explaining experimentally observed temperature evolutions of chiral distributions. Taking the chemical nature of the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> into account through interfacial energies, we derive structural maps and phase diagrams that will guide a rational choice of a <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> and growth parameters toward a better selectivity.</p>

Selective functionalization of methane, ethane, and higher alkanes by cerium photocatalysis
<p>With the recent soaring production of natural gas, the use of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e and other light hydrocarbon feedstocks as starting materials in synthetic transformations is becoming increasingly economically attractive, although it remains chemically challenging. We report the development of photocatalytic C–H amination, alkylation, and arylation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e, ethane, and higher alkanes under visible light irradiation at ambient temperature. High catalytic efficiency (turnover numbers up to 2900 for <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e and 9700 for ethane) and selectivity were achieved using abundant, inexpensive cerium salts as photo<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s. Ligand-to-metal charge transfer excitation generated alkoxy radicals from simple alcohols that in turn acted as hydrogen atom transfer <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s.

Aqueous Au-Pd colloids catalyze selective CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation to CH<sub>3</sub>OH with O<sub>2</sub> under mild conditions
<p>The selective oxidation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e, the primary component of natural gas, remains an important challenge in catalysis. We used colloidal gold-palladium nanoparticles, rather than the same nanoparticles supported on titanium oxide, to oxidize <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol with high selectivity (92%) in aqueous solution at mild temperatures. Then, using isotopically labeled oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as an oxidant in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>,</sub> we demonstrated that the resulting <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol incorporated a substantial fraction (70%) of gas-phase O<sub>2</sub>. More oxygenated products were formed than the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> consumed, suggesting that the controlled breakdown of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> activates <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e, which subsequently incorporates molecular oxygen through a radical process. If a source of methyl radicals can be established, then the selective oxidation of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e to <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>ol using molecular oxygen is possible.</p>

Vibrationally Promoted Dissociation of Water on Ni(111)

Prediction of higher-selectivity catalysts by computer-driven workflow and machine learning
<p><strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> design in asymmetric reaction development has traditionally been driven by empiricism, wherein experimentalists attempt to qualitatively recognize structural patterns to improve selectivity. Machine learning algorithms and chemoinformatics can potentially accelerate this process by recognizing otherwise inscrutable patterns in large datasets. Herein we report a computationally guided workflow for chiral <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> selection using chemoinformatics at every stage of development. Robust molecular descriptors that are agnostic to the <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> scaffold allow for selection of a universal training set on the basis of steric and electronic properties. This set can be used to train machine learning methods to make highly accurate predictive models over a broad range of selectivity space. Using support vector machines and deep feed-forward neural networks, we demonstrate accurate predictive modeling in the chiral phosphoric acid–catalyzed thiol addition to <i>N</i>-acylimines.</p>

Carbonyl catalysis enables a biomimetic asymmetric Mannich reaction

Background levels of methane in Mars’ atmosphere show strong seasonal variations
<p>Variable levels of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e in the martian atmosphere have eluded explanation partly because the measurements are not repeatable in time or location.

This variation is greater than that predicted from either ultraviolet degradation of impact-delivered organics on the surface or from the annual surface pressure cycle. The large seasonal variation in the background and occurrences of higher temporary spikes (~7 ppbv) are consistent with small localized sources of <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e released from martian surface or subsurface reservoirs.</p>

Lewis acid enhancement by hydrogen-bond donors for asymmetric catalysis
<p>Small-molecule dual hydrogen-bond (H-bond) donors such as ureas, thioureas, squaramides, and guanidinium ions enjoy widespread use as effective <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s for promoting a variety of enantioselective reactions. However, these <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s are only weakly acidic and therefore require highly reactive electrophilic substrates to be effective. We introduce here a mode of catalytic activity with chiral H-bond donors that enables enantioselective reactions of relatively unreactive electrophiles. Squaramides are shown to interact with silyl triflates by binding the triflate counterion to form a stable, yet highly Lewis acidic, complex. The silyl triflate-chiral squaramide combination promotes the generation of oxocarbenium intermediates from acetal substrates at low temperatures. Enantioselectivity in nucleophile additions to the cationic intermediates is then controlled through a network of noncovalent interactions between the squaramide <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> and the oxocarbenium triflate.</p>

Massive blow-out craters formed by hydrate-controlled methane expulsion from the Arctic seafloor

“Ab initio” synthesis of zeolites for preestablished catalytic reactions

Electrified methane reforming: A compact approach to greener industrial hydrogen production
<p>Electrification of conventionally fired chemical reactors has the potential to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and provide flexible and compact heat generation. Here, we describe a disruptive approach to a fundamental process by integrating an electrically heated catalytic structure directly into a steam-<strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">methan</span></strong>e–reforming (SMR) reactor for hydrogen production. Intimate contact between the electric heat source and the reaction site drives the reaction close to thermal equilibrium, increases <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> utilization, and limits unwanted byproduct formation. The integrated design with small characteristic length scales allows compact reactor designs, potentially 100 times smaller than current reformer platforms. Electrification of SMR offers a strong platform for new reactor design, scale, and implementation opportunities. Implemented on a global scale, this could correspond to a reduction of nearly 1% of all CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>

Here, we show that nitriles, largely viewed as insufficiently reactive, can be transformed directly to multifunctional unprotected homoallylic amines by enantioselective addition of a carbon-based nucleophile and diastereodivergent reduction of the resulting ketimine. Successful implementation requires that competing copper-based <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s be present simultaneously and that the slower-forming and less reactive one engages first. This challenge was addressed by incorporation of a nonproductive side cycle, fueled selectively by inexpensive additives, to delay the function of the more active <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>. The utility of this approach is highlighted by its application to the efficient preparation of the anticancer agent (+)-tangutorine.</p>

Catalytic palladium-oxyallyl cycloaddition
<p>Exploration of intermediates that enable chemoselective cycloaddition reactions and expeditious construction of fused- or bridged-ring systems is a continuous challenge for organic synthesis. As an intermediate of interest, the oxyallyl cation has been harnessed to synthesize architectures containing seven-membered rings via (4+3) cycloaddition. However, its potential to access five-membered skeletons is underdeveloped, largely due to the thermally forbidden (3+2) pathway. Here, the combination of a tailored precursor and a Pd(0) <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> generates a Pd-oxyallyl intermediate that cyclizes with conjugated dienes to produce a diverse array of tetrahydrofuran skeletons. The cycloaddition overrides conventional (4+3) selectivity by proceeding through a stepwise pathway involving a Pd-allyl transfer and ring closure sequence. Subsequent treatment of the (3+2) adducts with a palladium <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> converts the heterocycles to the carbocyclic cyclopentanones.</p>

Chiral Lewis acids integrated with single-walled carbon nanotubes for asymmetric catalysis in water

Assessment of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain
<p>Methane emissions from the U.S. oil and natural gas supply chain were estimated by using ground-based, facility-scale measurements and validated with aircraft observations in areas accounting for ~30% of U.S. gas production. When scaled up nationally, our facility-based estimate of 2015 supply chain emissions is 13 ± 2 teragrams per year, equivalent to 2.3% of gross U.S. gas production. This value is ~60% higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency inventory estimate, likely because existing inventory methods miss emissions released during abnormal operating conditions. Methane emissions of this magnitude, per unit of natural gas consumed, produce radiative forcing over a 20-year time horizon comparable to the CO<sub>2</sub> from natural gas combustion. Substantial emission reductions are feasible through rapid detection of the root causes of high emissions and deployment of less failure-prone systems.</p>

Activation of olefins via asymmetric Brønsted acid catalysis
<p>The activation of olefins for asymmetric chemical synthesis traditionally relies on transition metal <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s.

Although chemists have recently designed chiral Brønsted acid <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong>s to activate imines and carbonyl compounds, mimicking these enzymes to protonate simple olefins that then engage in asymmetric catalytic reactions has remained a substantial synthetic challenge. Here, we show that a class of confined and strong chiral Brønsted acids enables the catalytic asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of unbiased olefins. The methodology gives rapid access to biologically active 1,1-disubstituted tetrahydrofurans, including (–)-Boivinianin A.</p>

Selective formation of γ-lactams via C–H amidation enabled by tailored iridium catalysts

Activation of surface lattice oxygen in single-atom Pt/CeO<sub>2</sub> for low-temperature CO oxidation

Structural basis for methylphosphonate biosynthesis

The biosynthetic pathway of coenzyme F430 in methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea

Asymmetric nucleophilic fluorination under hydrogen bonding phase-transfer catalysis
<p>Common anionic nucleophiles such as those derived from inorganic salts have not been used for enantioselective catalysis because of their insolubility. Here, we report that merging hydrogen bonding and phase-transfer catalysis provides an effective mode of activation for nucleophiles that are insoluble in organic solvents. This catalytic manifold relies on hydrogen bonding complexation to render nucleophiles soluble and reactive, while simultaneously inducing asymmetry in the ensuing transformation. We demonstrate the concept using a chiral bis-urea <strong><span style="color:yellowgreen">catalyst</span></strong> to form a tridentate hydrogen bonding complex with fluoride from its cesium salt, thereby enabling highly efficient enantioselective ring opening of episulfonium ion. This fluorination method is synthetically valuable considering the scarcity of alternative protocols and points the way to wider application of the catalytic approach with diverse anionic nucleophiles.</p>

Cassini finds molecular hydrogen in the Enceladus plume: Evidence for hydrothermal processes
<p>Saturn’s moon Enceladus has an ice-covered ocean; a plume of material erupts from cracks in the ice.

We used the Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer onboard the Cassini spacecraft to detect molecular hydrogen in the plume. By using the instrument’s open-source mode, background processes of hydrogen production in the instrument were minimized and quantified, enabling the identification of a statistically significant signal of hydrogen native to Enceladus. We find that the most plausible source of this hydrogen is ongoing hydrothermal reactions of rock containing reduced minerals and organic materials.
